Extraction of Gold using the Borax Process. The borax process is also an environmentally-friendly method of extracting gold. Here the gold-bearing rock material is placed in a melting crucible and then borax (sodium borate) is added. The borax sinks the melting point of the ore mixture and makes the molten mass more fluid.

## Methods of Gold Mining - Geology In
Placer mining is the technique by which gold that has accumulated in a placer deposit is extracted. Placer deposits are composed of relatively loose material that makes tunneling difficult, and so most means of extracting it involve the use of water or dredging. Gold panning is mostly a manual technique of separating gold from other materials.

An artisanal miner or small-scale miner (ASM) is a subsistence miner who is not officially employed by a mining company, but works independently, mining minerals using their own resources, usually by hand.. Small-scale mining includes enterprises or individuals that employ workers for mining, but generally still using manually-intensive methods, working with hand tools.
