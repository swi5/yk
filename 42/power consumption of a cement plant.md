The production of 1 m³ of concrete requires 2,775 MJ of energy. This energy comes mostly from oil burning, which generates CO2. 2.775 MJ of energy is produced by 0.37 barrels of oil. Saving concrete, e.g. by adopting appropriate building solutions, means therefore not only reducing fossil fuels consumption, but also pollutant emissions.
