Borax anhydrous is an inorganic compound that has a white, fine crystal or powder appearace. Borax hydrates occur naturally in evaporite deposits produced by the repeated evaporation of seasonal lakes. Naturally occurring borax is refined by a process of recrystallization, but it can be produced synthetically from other boron compounds.

## Production of anhydrous borax from borax pentahydrate
As a result, anhydrous borax (Na2B4O7) is obtained including the following constituents as mass percentages; 68.24% B2O3 and 30.38% Na2O. The difficulties in the post-processing stage are overcome by the use of powder atomization unit and in the mean time, continuity in production is also established.

## Borax - What It Is and How It's Made - Puracy
The production of borax generally involves purifying and crystallizing processes to isolate it from brines or crude ore called tincal. Extracting borax from lake brines involves carbonating or evaporating the brine to create crystals. The products of the crystallization process are often turned into a powdered, dried product.
