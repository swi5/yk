## Greenpeace Complains China Is Approving More Coal Plants - Breitbart
Jul 20, 2022The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Greenpeace East Asia's distress that China is not only digging and burning more coal today, but it is still throwing up new coal-fired power plants at a dizzying rate, increasing its needs for tomorrow. China's 8.63 gigawatts of new coal plants in the first quarter of 2022 added nearly half as

## What Is Coal Power Plant and How Does it Work?
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station that burns coal to generate electricity. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station. The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin

## Analysis: Will China build hundreds of new coal plants in the 2020s?
Coal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel and still accounted for 57.7% of China's energy use in 2019, the data shows. Coal plants, which burn approximately 54% of all coal used in the country, provide 52% of generating capacity and 66% of electricity output - down from a peak of 81% in 2007. Coal-fired power capacity grew by around 40
