## The Effects Of Temperature On Concrete During Installation (PICP)
High temperatures during placing can also increase the voids in concrete, and this can severely affect its durability. High temperatures also tend to decrease the workability of concrete, and this makes it more difficult for proper consolidation. The fast hydration leads to concrete gaining its initial strength early and difficulties when it is

## The Effects Of Temperature On Concrete During Installation (PICP)
Temperatures during the manufacture and placing of concrete can affect its setting time and final strength. When temperatures are high, this can lead to cracks, and many mass concrete works use chilled water for the mixing process to control the temperature of the concrete and reduce the chances of cracking and damage.

In autogenous milling, temperature can significantly influence the grinding efficiency, particularly if the temperature falls below about 10°C. these efficiency changes can be reduced by preventing recycle water from becoming chilled, and by thawing frozen rock before grinding.
