## Seven countries with the largest iron ore reserves in the world
1. Australia - 48 billion tonnes. Australia is home to the largest reserves of iron ore worldwide, with an estimated 48 billion tonnes identified as of 2019. The majority of the country's iron ore resources are located in the state of Western Australia, particularly the Pilbara region, with much of the remainder based in South Australia.

## By products of bauxite?f
Aluminium can be extracted (uneconomically) from some clays but the most common aluminium ore is a material called bauxite. First the aluminium ore needs to be mined, then the bauxite is refined into alumina (aluminium oxide). Large amounts of electricity are used to smelt the alumina into aluminium metal.
