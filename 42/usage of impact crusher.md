## How does an impact crusher work? | RUBBLE MASTER
Impact crushers reduce mineral materials such as concrete, asphalt and natural rock in size to produce a valuable commodity product. A fast spinning rotor throws the material against a solid stationary impact wall. The striking and impacting causes the material to shatter into smaller pieces. The result is a very homogenous and cubical product

## Impact vs cone crushers: Which is more effective? - Quarry
The smaller the output size, the more competitive impact crushers become because their percentage of finished product in the first pass is considerably higher than cone crushers. Combined with an upgrade to wear parts materials, this can allow impact crushers to reach a lower wear-cost ratio (per tonne) than cone crushers (see Table 1).
