## Natural Stone: Problems and Solutions for the use in outdoor areas 
In climate zones, exposed to frost and thaw, the stone surface is permanently stressed. Usually limestone is more sensitive to frost than hard stones (e.g. granite). To protect the stone against chipping and weathering, an impregnation is highly recommended. The impregnation will keep the vapour permeability of the stone.

## Limestone, scaling, fouling in water - Vesi Process
Hard water may cause a film on glass shower doors, shower walls, and bathtubs. Hair washed in hard water may feel sticky and look dull. Hard water creates white deposits (limestone) inside the pipes and also outside the pipes at the joints. This is why limestone is, after the taste, the second ground of not drinking tap water.

## In Sect. 4 an-selbsthilfegruppe
In Sect. 4 an example application of the Gaussian process predictor of runup inside a morphodynamic model of coastal dune erosion to build a hybrid model (Goldstein and Coco, 2015; Krasnopolsky and Fox-Rabinovitz, 2006) that can generate ensemble output is presented. What Is Erosion and Deposition? Pablo's little adventure is an example of what's always happening in nature.
