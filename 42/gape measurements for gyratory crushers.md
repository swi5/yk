## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The gyratory crushers crush to reduce the size by a maximum of about one-tenth its size. Usually, metallurgical operations require greater size reduction; hence, the products from the primary crushers are conveyed to secondary or cone crushers where further reduction in size takes place. Here, the maximum reduction ratio is about 8:1.

## Checking Crusher Gap -Measuring Crusher Chamber Spacing
A lump of lead, whose dimensions are greater than the gap of the crusher, is lowered through the crusher while the crusher is running. The lead is pulled back through the crusher very slowly to be sure that it is flattened as far as it can be. The narrowest point on the lead is then measured. This will be the SET POINT of the crusher.
