## How does the iron ore beneficiation process work? - Quora
Answer (1 of 2): At its basic level, iron ore beneficiation consists of the following steps: 1. Crush and grind to a sufficiently fine size that the iron oxide minerals are broken free of the gangue minerals like silica (Liberation) 2. Physically sort the mineral grains to produce a concentrate
