The belt conveyor comprises a belt that rests on top of a smooth metal bed or rollers. When the distance is long, belt conveyors with rollers are the most suitable option, as the rollers help to reduce friction. It is not necessary for belt conveyors to be straight. They also can turn corners with a special attachment.
