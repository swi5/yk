## Iron Ore Analysis & Process Optimization Solutions
This saves mining operations multiple millions in USD every month since iron ore beneficiation increases significantly the costs per ton of ore. Control of the moisture content on the mining conveyor belt (NIR) together with accurate monitoring of the composition of iron ore before shipment guaranties constant ore quality to avoids penalties.

## Mining Exploration Process - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Mining is a high risk enterprise and as the British SAS motto says "who dares wins" or "you snooze you lose". Generally much of the exploration industry is now supported by the efforts of the junior exploration companies with the Majors depending on the Juniors discoveries but there is a problem with an industry model that relies on juniors.

## How Is The Iron Ore Mined? - FTM Machinery
Therefore, the mining of iron ore has been controlled by several large companies. Iron ore is the main component of steel and accounts for 95% of the world's metal use each year. The world's largest single iron ore producer is the Brazilian mining company called Vale, which produces more than 350 million tons of iron ore per year.

The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

The first and most obvious is the process of open pit mining. Huge tracts of land are stripped to bare rock. Today, depleted mining sites are commonly used as landfills, then covered over and landscaped.  The process of extracting iron from ore produces great quantities of poisonous and corrosive gases. In practice, these gases are scrubbed

To be competitive, iron ore mining need to be done on a very large scale. There are two mining methods which are commonly employed. They are (i) surface mining, (ii) underground or shaft mining. The decision to employ underground or surface mining techniques is dependent on the proximity of the ore body to the surface.

manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Manganese (Mn) is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 °C (2,271 °F). Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such as sulfur and oxygen and adds important physical properties to the metal.
