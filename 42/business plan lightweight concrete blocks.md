Concrete is considered to be lightweight is the density is not more than 2200kg/m 3 (the density of normal weight concrete is assumed to be between 2300kg/m 3 and 2400kg/m 3) and a proportion of the aggregate should have a density of less than 2000kg/m 3.

## How to Make Lightweight Concrete Blocks | DoItYourself
Mix Water. To begin the process, add five gallons of water to the mixer. If you are planning on changing the color of the blocks, then insert dyes, colorants or other tinting additives at this time. Once everything is thoroughly mixed, proceed to the next step. If using a mixer is not an option, you can create concrete blocks by hand.

A lightweight concrete block is an engineering control that may help reduce heavy lifting and carrying. The lightweight concrete block is a concrete masonry unit (CMU) made of expanded aggregate to reduce the density and weight compared to standard concrete block. Weights vary significantly, but are less heavy than CMUs' with denser aggregates.
