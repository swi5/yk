The first step of Beneficiation is to crush or grind the coal to liberate the coaly matter from ashy matter which can theoretically yield complete liberation. In the case of intergrown texture, finer grinding up to a few micron size is necessary for complete liberation whereas for free dirt ordinary crushing is sufficient (Kumar, D., 1982).

## Dry beneficiation of fine coal using a fluidized dense medium bed
A commercial dry coal cleaning plant (50 2 6 mm feed) using an air-dense medium fluidized bed has been established in China. It is an important clean coal technology (CCT) due to insufficient water. 44 Highly Influential View 1 excerpt Modularized dry coal beneficiation technique based on gas-solid fluidized bed Yue-min Zhao, Gongmin Li, +4 authors

methods. Fine coal retains more water, which lowers its heating value. Drying the coal is costly and it is difficult to achieve the required moisture content. Consequently, coal fines are often discarded. An estimated 8% of the total energy value of mined coal is lost1. Fluidized bed technology is often used to dry coal thermally, but this
