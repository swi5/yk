## End Uses of Landfills | Geoengineer
The method most commonly applied in the case of landfill end-uses is through the use of PV (photovoltaic) cells (Prajnasmita Mohapatra, et al, 2012). Within the realm of photovoltaic cells, there are two PV technologies that have been used extensively in commercial solar applications; crystalline silicon and thin film (USEPA, 2013).

##  Landfills in Malaysia: Past, Present and Future - UM
In Malaysia, the absence of an integrated waste management system resulted with more than 10.40 million tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) being disposed off into landfills annually. This highlights the importance of landfills in MSW management in Malaysia. However, sustainable landfilling technology is yet to be achieved.

## Trends in sustainable landfilling in Malaysia, a developing country 
Abstract. In Malaysia, landfills are being filled up rapidly due to the current daily generation of approximately 30 000 tonnes of municipal solid waste. This situation creates the crucial need for improved landfilling practices, as sustainable landfilling technology is yet to be achieved here. The objective of this paper is to identify and

Landfills are located, designed, operated and monitored to ensure compliance with federal regulations. They are also designed to protect the environment from contaminants, which may be present in the waste stream. Landfills cannot be built in environmentally-sensitive areas, and they are placed using on-site environmental monitoring systems.

Landfill space fills up fast. Americans generate about 4.4 pounds of trash per day, and while some of it is recyclable, most ends up in the dump. Now, many local landfills are closing because there's no more room. In 1990, there were 6,326 active landfills in the United States. As of 2018, that number is now down to 1,269.
