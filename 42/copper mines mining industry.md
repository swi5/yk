Apr 13, 2021Copper is one of the most commonly-used metals worldwide, and many of the largest mining companies are involved in its extraction from the earth. The reddish-gold metal has a range of industrial uses, and is often used in electronics due to its high electrical conductivity and its ability to be easily shaped into wiring.

A major copper and sulphur mine opened in the Eastern Townships around 1860, which was also when asbestos was first mined.  The growth of the mining industry, which coincided with large-scale industrial expansion elsewhere, quickly made Québec an important source of minerals for the most highly industrialized areas of North America.
