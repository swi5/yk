## Complete Guide: Testing Cleavage of a Mineral like a PRO
Types of Cleavage Minerals. Most people are confused when it is cleavage as it is commonly not clear why somebody uses comparatives like perfect, good, and poor, but others star counting directions, and third use cubic, rhombic and basal. So it is a different description of cleavage, and now we will explain how to combine them like a PRO!

Before going to the types of minerals first of all we need to discuss minerals. Minerals are inorganic solid compounds found in nature that are formed by geological processes. Different types of minerals are found in the earth's crust some of them are unnamed as well. And among the minerals found only 30 of them are most common and important.

Rocks and minerals are important for learning about earth materials, structure, and systems. Studying these natural objects incorporates an understanding of earth science, chemistry, physics, and math. The learner can walk away with an understanding of crystal geometry, the ability to visualize 3-D objects, or knowing rates of crystallization.
