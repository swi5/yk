Since the turbine creates rotational motion, it is particularly suitable for driving electric generators. For example, in 2014, the U.S. About 85% of all the electricity in the U.S. was generated using steam turbines . A turbo generator is a steam turbine connected to an electric generator. Steam turbines were developed years before gas turbines.

## Modeling Conveyor Screws (AKA, flight screws, spiral screws)
Does anyone knows of a add-in tool for SolidWorks 2004 that will greatly help you design Conveyor Screws (AKA, flight screws, spiral screws) I need to develop a small Powder Dispensing Unit that will use a small motor rotating the 1.5-inch screw, which moves forward and dispenses the granulated type powder inside the hopper.

##  Screw Conveyor
best conveyor design. Since the Screw Conveyor selected is based on a maximum volume control of material to be handled, surge loads, overloads and choke feeding must be accounted for in the conveyor design. Screw feeders are popularly used for this control and are discussed in other pages of this catalog. CLASSIFY YOUR MATERIAL
