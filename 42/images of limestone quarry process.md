The quarrying process is also known as "extraction.". This procedure consists of removing blocks or large pieces of stone from a previously identified geological deposit. The different methods used to quarry or extract the limestone depends on the specific properties of the limestone deposit itself, including density, bedding planes, and depth.

Limestone fines are a controversial material and we recommend doing a little research before you make this choice. Make sure you avoid using round rocks like pea gravel under your walkway because they do not pack in as well. Crushed rock has more mechanical bond, because the broken and jagged edges lock together better than round ones do.

Limestone. Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime. It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate ( CaCO3 ). Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium.
