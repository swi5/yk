The beneficiation of coal, particularly for export, results in more than 65Mt of coal discards being produced every year. About 21 percent of the run-of-mine coal produced is exported, and 21 percent is used locally (excluding power-station coal).

Coal seams are relatively thick and close to the surface, which allows for low-cost mining; a quarter of South Africa's bituminous coal is between 15-50 m below the surface and much of the remainder between 50-200m. Half of reserves are in seams 4-6m thick and a further third in 2-4m seams (Petrick Commission, 1975).
