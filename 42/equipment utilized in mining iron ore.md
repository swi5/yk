Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.

## Iron Mining Process - Minnesota Iron
Iron Mining Process. From blasting to crushing to separation - more than 85% of the iron mined in the United States is mined in northeastern Minnesota to make our nation's steel. Blasting Taconite is a very hard rock. Using explosives, the taconite is blasted into small pieces.  The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism
