## Geophysical and Geotechnical Approaches in Developing  - SpringerLink
A study of a foundation depth has been carried out using the geophysical method to construct a gas engine power plant, operating at 130 MW in Ladong, Aceh Province. Vertical electrical sounding (VES) is a geophysical technique that uses direct current to determine subsurface resistivity. The method was employed at three stations for subsurface soil resistivity analysis by utilizing the

##  The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Accident: OECD/NEA Nuclear Safety
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (NPP) accident that occurred on 11 March 2011 following a massive earthquake and tsunami was one of the most severe accidents ever experienced at a nuclear power plant and will have to be dealt with for many years by those in charge of nuclear safety (operators, safety bodies). Following the

## Geotechnical groutingnthey
Grouting is a technique used to improve the engineering properties of soils and rocks. In this paper two types of micro-cements have been tested: a fast-reacting cement, composed by pure clinker (MasterRoc MP 650) and a slow-reacting cement with 80% slag (MasterRoc MP 680). Injection tests were performed in a column filled with the Hostun sand.
