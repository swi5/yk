## Limestone | Density, Heat Capacity, Thermal Conductivity
Limestone - Thermal Conductivity. Thermal conductivity of Limestone is 1.3 W/ (m·K). The heat transfer characteristics of a solid material are measured by a property called the thermal conductivity, k (or λ), measured in W/m.K. It is a measure of a substance's ability to transfer heat through a material by conduction.
