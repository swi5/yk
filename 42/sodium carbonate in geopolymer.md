## Sodium carbonate
Sodium carbonate, Na 2 C O 3, (also known as washing soda, soda ash and soda crystals) is the inorganic compound with the formula Na 2 CO 3 and its various hydrates. All forms are white, odourless, water-soluble salts that yield moderately alkaline solutions in water. Historically, it was extracted from the ashes of plants growing in sodium

The sodium carbonate in the powdered mixture has a median particle size ranging from 80 to 200 microns to improve its solubility. This median particle size range can be achieved by milling the sodium carbonate prior to storage in hopper 16. The geopolymer cement from blender 18 is stored in silo 22 before transport to a concrete plant. The

## A novel method to produce dry geopolymer cement powder
According to researchers [1], [19], [20], three steps are suggested in the geopolymerization process: (1) dissolution in alkaline solution; (2) reorganization and diffusion of dissolved ions with formation of small coagulated structures and (3) polycondensation of soluble species to form hydrated products.

## Geopolymer Concrete - The Eco Friendly Alternate to Concrete - NBM&CW
Geopolymer concrete (GPC) is an eco friendly product which uses industrial waste by-products such as fly ash (waste from thermal power plants) and ground granulated Blast Furnace Slag (waste from Iron production) as complete replacement for cement in concrete. As a result of this geopolymer concrete reduces CO 2 emissions by 80%.

## Novel synthesis of lightweight geopolymer matrices from fly ash through 
The lightweight geopolymer matrices were synthesized by mixing Class F fly ash with an activating solution. The activating agents used in this study were Na 2 CO 3 (a basic salt) and sodium silicate (waterglass). Reagent grade sodium carbonate powder of 99.98% purity and a specific gravity of 2.54 g/cm 3 was used.

During geosynthesis kaolinite clay (naturally included in the Giza limestone) first reacts with caustic soda (see chemical formula 2). To manufacture this caustic soda, one uses Egyptian natron (sodium carbonate) and lime (coming from plant ashes) (see chemical formula 1). The so obtained caustic soda, NaOH, will react with clay.

## (PDF) Effect of Sodium Silicate Types on the High Calcium Geopolymer 
Geopolymer mortars were produced by replacement of high calcium fly ash with cement at the percentages of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 100%. Sodium hydroxide was used as the activator and sodium

## Geopolymer-carbonated apatite nanocomposites with magnesium and 
Geopolymer and geopolymer-carbonated apatite showed higher hardness, compressive strength, and modulus elasticity compared with geopolymer-carbonated apatite containing Mg 2+ and/or Sr 2+. Nevertheless, all samples showed mechanical properties that could be applied as dental restoration materials.

## Alteration in molecular structure of alkali activated slag with various 
This is in line with the study of Pouhet et al. 19 that sodium carbonate was formed in the pore solution of metakaolin-based geopolymer under natural carbonation, while sodium bicarbonate was observed at 50% CO 2.
