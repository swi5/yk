Crushing. Crushers, whether large primary crushers or secondary cone crushers and impact crushers are large generators of dust. The air movement through the crushers can generate high velocity dust moving through the process. Dry Fog can be used for treating the dust as it is moving through the process and capture the airborne dust particulate.

Specifically, excess water addition to coal and coke used for boiler fuel results in a BTU penalty. The more water added, the greater this penalty. Methods to improve dust suppression while limiting the addition of water include the use of a 'dry fog' or the addition of surfactant chemicals to water, which is then applied as a spray or foam.
