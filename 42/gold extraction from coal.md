Coal mining began in Alabama in the early 1830's, and large-scale mining began with the opening of the Montevallo mine in 1856. (1) Conse­quently, the story of gold mining and the men who worked the mines in the state prior to 1860 is practically legendary. (2) Gold was first discovered in East Alabama about 1830. Already it had been found in

## Modern alchemy: Russian scientists discover how to extract gold from coal
The discovery of gold lacing in coal is the result of 15 years of study from different fields. To create the gold, smoke created in burning coal goes through a hundred-fold purifying system. The residue is then flushed through a filter with water, allowing a gold concentrate to be extracted that is later used to make the precious metal. via GIPHY.
