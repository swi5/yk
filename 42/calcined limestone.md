## Studies have shown shell as a fertilizer increases crop productivity 
Oyster Shell vs Seashells as a fertilizer, 11:30 PM Hey guys, I was doing some searching and I can't seem to figure out something that should be simple. So I know that crushed oyster shells is a common ingredient used instead of limestone and that figs love the ever living hell out of it. Plus it gives you some calcium which is great.

## Calcination
The root of the word calcination refers to its most prominent use, which is to remove carbon from limestone through combustion to yield calcium oxide (quicklime). This calcination reaction is CaCO 3 (s) → CaO (s) + CO 2 (g). Calcium oxide is a crucial ingredient in modern cement, and is also used as a chemical flux in smelting.

## What is Lime: Lime vs Limestone - Mintek Resources
Once crushed and sized, the limestone is fed into kilns where it is calcined, basically cooked, at temperatures as high as 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. During this progression the extreme heat causes the limestone to chemically release carbon dioxide (CO2). The end result is lime. Products Lime can be manufactured in a number of different end products.

A thorough application of pulverized limestone tilled into the soil raises the pH to a neutral level, increasing crop yields and improving overall soil health.

## Calcined clay limestone cements (LC) | Semantic Scholar
Calcined clay limestone cements (LC) The use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) to replace part of the clinker in cement is the most successful strategy to reduce CO2 emissions in the global cement industry. However, limited supplies of conventional SCMs make it difficult to take this strategy further unless new types of SCMs become

In order to analyze HCl and SO 2 retention in fluidized bed combustors of coal and wastes, chlorination and sulphation of calcined limestone were investigated at 1023 K and atmospheric pressure using thermogravimetry. The rate of chlorination of calcined limestone slightly depended on its particle size and was kept almost constant against the progress of chlorination.
