Beasley River, located near Tom Price in Western Australia, is an inferred resource of approximately 400 million tonnes of pisolitic ore. The geographical and geological characteristics of the Beasley River deposit complement and enhance the pisolite resources available to the Robe participants at Pannawonica and elsewhere in the Robe valley.

## Robe River - Pannawonica iron ore mine - Wood Mac
Pannawonica is one of two mines in Robe River JV and is operated by majority owner Rio Tinto. It has annual production of 34 million tonnes. Due to the simplistic nature of mining pisolite ore, Pannawonica is one of Rio Tinto's lowest cost mines. The mine also has the lowest strip ratio of any Rio Tinto mine at 0.4:1, assisting in keeping costs

## The origin of terrestrial pisoliths and pisolitic iron ore deposits 
Typically occurring near or on the surface in deeply weathered terrains, pisoliths are spheroidal soil components, ranging up to 5 mm in diameter and consist of a core containing aggregated soil particles, mineral particles such as quartz, hematite, or lithic fragments, surrounded by one or more concentric layers forming a distinct cortex.

A pisolite is a sedimentary rock made of pisoids, which are concretionary grains - often of calcium carbonate, but sometimes of rarer minerals - which resemble ooids but are always more than 2 mm in diameter. These grains are approximately spherical and have concentric layers reaching 10 mm in diameter.
