## Full Guide To Calcite vs. Quartz (This Is The Difference)
Calcite is a much softer stone compared to quartz. Quartz rates 7, while calcite rates 3 in hardness on the Mohs scale. If you're unfamiliar, the Mohs scale of hardness determines a stone's hardness by measuring how scratch-resistant it is. According to this scale, a stone can scratch any other mineral with a lower score.

## Difference Between Calcite and Dolomite
Dolomite differs from calcite because of the presence of magnesium. • Calcite reacts quickly with acids and produce carbon dioxide bubbles. But dolomite is weakly reacts with acids producing bubbles very slowly. When hot acids or powdered dolomite is used they may react quickly. • Dolomite is slightly harder and denser than calcite.

The term "marble" is used for the stone that is built into everything from worktops, floors, walls and even the walls of houses and offices. Although dolomite marble slab is harder than typical calcite or marble, it is not as hard as granite, because it reacts weakly with acid and can still be easily scratched and scratched.

Calcite also forms flat, rhomboid "poker chip" crystals, but dolomite does not. Calcite responds vigorously to acid, while dolomite responds less vigorously. Calcite is 3 on the Mohs Scale of Hardness, but dolomite is only Mohs 4-4.5. One other difference you may see is the smoothness of the crystal faces on your specimen.

## The Difference Between - Rock and Minerals 4Him
Selenite can look similar to calcite, but the main identifier is that selenite is very soft. Gypsum is a 2 and calcite is a 3. It's only a difference of 1 on the Mohs scale, but it's a huge difference because a fingernail has a hardness of 2.5. You can scratch selenite with your fingernail but not calcite. Calcite has a ton of unique identifiers.

## Frontiers | Automated mineralogy (SEM-EDS) approach to sandstone 
Dolomite (D) occurs as dispersed crystals with ferroan-dolomite (Df) rims. Calcite (Ca) cement sits on top of ferroan dolomite suggesting that calcite was the last carbonate cement to devlop. Gypsum cement (GA) has developed after the ferroan dolomite and calcite and this sulphate cement has here occluded most of the pores.
