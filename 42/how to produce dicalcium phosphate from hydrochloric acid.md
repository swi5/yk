##  Dicalcium Phosphate From Rock Phosphate
•Dicalcium phosphate shows the most commonly used production method is known as the "wet acid" route in which rock phosphate is reacted with sulphuric acid to produce phosphoric acid. After concentration and purification to reduce the level of undesirable elements, this phosphoric acid is reacted with a calcium source such as quick lime

## Monocalcium phosphate
Monocalcium phosphate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2 ("AMCP" or "CMP-A" for anhydrous monocalcium phosphate). It is commonly found as the monohydrate ("MCP" or "MCP-M"), Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2 ·H 2 O. Both salts are colourless solids. They are used mainly as superphosphate fertilizers and are also popular leavening agents.
