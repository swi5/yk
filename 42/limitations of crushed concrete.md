3. Concrete has Low Toughness. Ability of a material to consume impact energy is called toughness. It is the area under the load displacement curve. Another limitation of concrete is that compared to steel, the concrete has significantly low toughness. Toughness of concrete is only 1-2% of steel.

Eco-friendliness is another big benefit of crushed concrete. Using this material helps slow down the production of new concrete and also frees up space in landfills. It prevents demolished concrete from sitting around taking up space and puts it to good use. Depending on how you have it installed, it's also rather permeable.
