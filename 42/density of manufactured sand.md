## Density Of Cement Sand and Aggregate in Kg/M3 - HPD TEAM
The density of coarse sand varies between 1450 and 2082 kg/m3 depending on the situation, such as wet, dry, loose, dry packed, or wet packed. Sand can be either natural or man-made. Natural sand is gathered from river basins, while manufactured sand (m sand) is produced by crushing stones in a crusher mill.
