With coal, this approach is problematic. According to Schenck, coal density changes with size, moisture and a variety of other factors. Therefore, even if an operation were processing coal of equal dimensions, each piece may have a different density. In light of this reality, gravimetric weigh feeders are the better option.

Ralph Hardgrove, a Babcock & Wilcox retiree who joined Stock Equipment Company in 1961 (at 70 years of age), led the feeder's development into general industry acceptance by the mid-1960s, when most large coal-fired boilers included gravimetric feed systems in their design. The first Stock gravimetric feeder operated from 1957 to 1992, to be
