## Iron ore pricing explained - Fastmarkets
In general, higher purity ores help increase hot metal yields in the blast furnace, and also lower production cost by reducing the amount of coke required. For these reasons, the rule of thumb is "higher Fe grade, higher price.". Iron ore also differs in physical form. Fines require sintering (agglomeration into crude pellets) prior to use

Pellets are small balls of iron ore used in steel production. They are one of the important sources of iron in the manufacture of steel. Pellet production is the basis of the steel production process. Steel pellets are made from iron ore powder with additives such as limestone, dolomite, olivine and binder bentonite.

A $2 fee on a $10, 14 day advance is the equivalent of an 521% APR. Even at $100, the APR equivalent is 260%. Even ignoring the potential APR equivalent, the "cash advance" structure and short repayment timeframe would appear to violate Facebook advertising and Apple and Google app policies outlined above.

## Iron ore fluxed pellets and their physical properties
The crushing strength of the fluxed pellets produced increased with increasing the amount of bentonite addition. This is because, as stated before, the cementing action of bentonite improved the resistance of pellets to breakage- This is particularly noticeable in the case of limestone pellets as well as fluxed iron ore pellets.
