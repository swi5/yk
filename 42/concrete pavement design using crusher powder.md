## Crushed concrete wichita ksert-durch-elf
The evolution of crushed concrete in Haysville, KS has seen products like type 1 and type 2 with reduced fines which has become a favorite with spots pitch producers. The grading certificates for these types of materials now only show particle size and material make up! The use of the material is now down to the architects or engineers.

Insuring the use of quality concrete. Concrete for pavements should be designed to reach 4000 psi compressive strength at 28 days. But an even more important characteristic of quality concrete is durability. It must stand up over time, through all kinds of traffic, wet and dry weather, and freeze/thaw cycles, if these are a factor.
