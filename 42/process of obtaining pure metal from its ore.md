The process is called phytomining and it can also be used to extract metals from contaminated land. Brassicas (the cabbage family) can extract metals including cadmium, cobalt and nickel. Copper can also be extracted by displacement from a copper salt solution using scrap iron. Pure copper (99Â·99%) is needed for good electrical conductivity

## Extraction of Metals: Methods, Processes Involved, Minerals, and Ores
May 7, 2021On passing the current through the electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode dissolves into the electrolyte. An equivalent amount of pure metal from the electrolyte is deposited on the cathode. The soluble impurities go into the solution, whereas, the insoluble impurities settle down at the bottom of the anode and are known as anode mud.

## process of separating pure metals from it ore
The process of extracting the metal from the ore may be divided generally into two broad steps:-- the reduction of the combined metal in the ore to the free metal by the use of energy in one or other of its forms; the purification of the metal obtained. This is known as refining.
