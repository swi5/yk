## Belt Conveyor Structural Design - Standards
Experts, What standard do your companies use in the design of the structures that support belt conveyors? The structural verification itself isn't really an issue. The loads and load combinations, however, can create some interesting discussions. The belt conveyor isn't a building to be designed as per ASCE 7-05 or AISE Nr 13 and neither is a mobile machine to comply with ISO 5049-1, AS-4324

A troughed belt conveyor consists of a wide belt typically running on three idler rolls. The outer wing rollers are sloped upwards to form the trough shape. The troughed belt then travels over the idler sets to transport the load. A conventional troughed belt conveyor has the following components: • Idlers.

Experts, What standard do your companies use in the design of the structures that support belt conveyors? The structural verification itself isn't really an issue. The loads and load combinations, however, can create some interesting discussions. The belt conveyor isn't a building to be designed as per ASCE 7-05 or AISE Nr 13 and neither is a mobile machine to comply with ISO 5049-1, AS-4324

Carcass. The carcass is the most important part of a conveyor belt, as it has to absorb the tensile stresses imposed on the belt to convey the material and to comply with all mechanical and thermal requirements. The purpose of the rubber covers is to protect the carcass. The quality of the covers depends on the application of the conveyor belt.

Motor and Gearbox Specifications. When carrying out belt conveyor load calculation, the total payload on the belt conveyor as well as the area the load will take up on the conveyor need to be considered. Most belt conveyors are designed with the belt being dragged over a stainless steel deck. This causes friction between the belt and the deck.

## Material Live load on a Belt Conveyor - Structural engineering general 
Conveyors are uniformly loaded normally. A belt speed at 160 FPM means in one minute, 6666.67 Lb of material is spread out over 160 feet. OR 6666.67/160 = 41.67 Say 42 PLF material load. This is most likely not conservative, because conveyors are run overloaded all the time in industrial operations. StrP88 (Civil/Environmental) (OP)
