## Biological beneficiation of kaolin: A review on iron removal
Therefore, the first beneficiation step to make these raw materials commercially valuable is to effectively eliminate iron oxides from kaolinite clays and vice versa (Poorni and Natarajan, 2013). The iron removal processes can be categorized as physical, chemical, or a combination of both (Prasad et al., 1991, de Mesquita et al., 1996).
