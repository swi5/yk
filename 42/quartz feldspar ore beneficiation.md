and secondary crushers and ground by jaw crushers, cone crushers, and rod mills until it is reduced to less than 841 um (20 mesh). A froth flotation process is used for most feldspar ore beneficiation. Feldspar Occurrence (an example) The Spruce Pine (in US) alaskite is a light coloured, medium- to coarse-grained feldspar-quartz-muscovite rock.
