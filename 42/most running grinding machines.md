## In Grinding, Coolant Application Matters - SME
I use a flow rate based upon the grinding power created during the process, because the more aggressive a cycle is, the more coolant is applied. With conventional abrasive wheels, a flow rate of 2 gpm/hp is effective. For superabrasive wheels, a flow rate close to 1 gpm/hp (3.8 L/min/hp) works well.
