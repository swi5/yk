## The diatomaceous earth is used to insulate boilers and steam pipes because
Shells of diatoms are highly resistant to decomposition due to the presence of silica and are deposited in ocean beds leading to the formation of the diatomaceous earth. This is used as filters because its silica content makes it chemically inactive and uncompressible during insulation. Thus, the correct answer is option D. Was this answer helpful?
