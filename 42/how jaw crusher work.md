However, there are many exceptions to this general rule. A Jaw Crusher reduces large size rocks or ore by placing the rock into compression. A fixed jaw, mounted in a "V" alignment is the stationary breaking surface, while the movable jaw exerts force on the rock by forcing it against the stationary plate.

In a double-toggle jaw crusher, the moving crusher jaw is driven by the eccentric shaft that moves the front and rear toggles up and down. Each shaft revolution causes the moving crusher jaw to close at the downstroke and open up during the upstroke. The toggle is kept in place by spring-loaded tension rod.

## Talcumbookdate
Talcum powder works great as a silicone mold release agent, but on molds that have fewer details. For example, a half-sphere mold or gem-shaped mold.

This is because the powder does not cover the mold properly, so it wont prevent the resin from sticking to these areas.
