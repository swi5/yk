Residual soil are formed 'in-situ' that is formed in their original position by the breaking up of parent rocks, e.g. Black Soil, Red soil, Laterite Soil, Desert Soil etc. Soils that are transported through various agents of soil erosion like wind and running water, e.g. Alluvial Soil. Soils are classified into the following types- Alluvial

## What is an example of transported soil? - Short-Facts
The main difference between the transported soil and the residual soil is that the transported soil is blown or washed away from its parent rock . The residual soil is the one that remains a place of formation. Residual soils remain above their parent rock, and their characteristics depend on the characteristics of the parent rock.

Sep 4, 2021The biggest difference between residual soil and transported soil is that transported soil, by its very definition, has to go somewhere. It is somehow moved away from the original location and the original rock from which it was created. Residual soil, on the other hand, stays more or less in the same place. Because of this, residual soil tends

Formation of Soil. Primarily soils are formed from rocks through physical and chemical weathering. If weathered rock material remains over a parent rock then the soils are known as Residual soils.If weathered material is transported and deposited at some other location then the soils are called Transported Soil.The transporting agency may be water, wind, glaciers or gravity force.
