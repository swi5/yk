Raw materials of the cement plant are mostly from open-pit mines, and the ore size of large mines can reach 1.5-1.8m. In the preparation of cement raw materials, we first need to crush limestone, gypsum, clay and other materials into proper size to facilitate the subsequent transportation and storage, at the same time make full preparations for the next process (cement raw materials grinding).

## Concrete Crushing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The desired concrete crushing failures shown in Figs. 1.24 and 1.25 can only be achieved if IC, CDC and PE debonding can be prevented from occurring before the design load to cause concrete crushing. However, this may not always be possible; in which case, it may be necessary to design for either IC or CDC debonding to occur at the design load so that concrete crushing will not occur.
