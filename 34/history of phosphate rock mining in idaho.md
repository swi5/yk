Today, it is home to 17 Superfund sites, thanks to phosphate mining giants Simplot, Agrium, Monsanto and Rhodia. The phosphate here is primarily used as fertilizer and the herbicide RoundUp. Currently 16,987 acres have been mined with an additional 7,340 acres slated for development. In addition 15,000 acres have been leased and 50,000 acres

Mining first began in the United States in 1867 in South Carolina. Phosphate rock was discovered in central Florida in the 1880s, and because of the extensive, high-quality deposits and lower mining cost, it quickly became the leading phosphate-producing state.
