Crushed stone is available in a variety of sizes, from 3/8" to 4". Because it is literally crushed stone, there is no consistency to its shape. The edges tend to be sharper and it feels rougher to the touch than pea gravel. Also, most crushed stone will either be in a white or gray hue, giving you a more neutral look than the colorful pea gravel.
