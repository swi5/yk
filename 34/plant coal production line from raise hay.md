## Coal and its application in the cement production process
The selected coal oxide is much cheaper than 4A bran coal, so when put into production, it is still guaranteed to increase productivity and quality along with keeping the product cost. The solution of using coal oxide in the production of rotary kiln cement clinker has been applied by many cement factories many years ago.
