## What can Limestone be used for in construction?
It is not only cost-effective and affordable but also provides a long term and durable solution in construction. Limestone is a very strong construction material that can be used both indoors and outdoors. Since it is resistant to almost all kinds of weather, it provides the same looks and sturdiness for years to come.
