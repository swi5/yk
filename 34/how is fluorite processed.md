The same is used in production of hydrofluoric acid, which is used in a wide variety of industrial applications including glass etching. Fluorite tends to occur in well-formed isometric crystals, forming cubes and octahedrons. It also occurs in both massive and earthy forms, and as crusts or globular aggregates with radial fibrous texture.

Fluorite or fluorspar is the mineral form of calcium fluoride (CaF 2).The mineral may occur as massive (Fig. 1.15) or vein-type deposit, in association with metallic minerals forming a part of mineralization.The associated minerals include barite, calcite, quartz, galena, sphalerite, and pyrite (Fig. 1.16).The vein-type mineralization is of hydrothermal origin.
