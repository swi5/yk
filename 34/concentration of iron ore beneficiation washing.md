## ore washing beneficiation
The high grade hematite iron ores require simple crushing and washing. As the grade of ore is declining, run-of-mine ore needs intense washing before shipment. Depending upon the origin and mineralogical characteristics of the ore, beneficiation methods vary from simple crushing and screening to complex concentration processes.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Several methods/techniques such as washing, jigging, magnetic separation, gravity separation, and flotation etc. are used to enhance the Fe content of the Iron ore and to reduce its gangue content. These techniques are used in various combinations for the beneficiation of iron ores. For beneficiation of a particular iron ore the emphasis is
