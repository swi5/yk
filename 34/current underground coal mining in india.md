## Mining Methods - Indian Infrastructure
Primarily, there are two types of mining methods being used for the extraction of minerals and ores - surface/opencast mining and underground mining. The choice of method is largely determined by factors such as depth, geology of the mineral deposit and the cost of equipment. In India, surface mining is more prevalent, producing most of the

## Developments Made for Mechanised Extraction of Locked-Up Coal Pillars 
Underground mining in India has not boomed to that extent due to the less rock mechanics advances in B&P mining method. Depillaring continues to be one of the most challenging and hazardous activities in underground coal mining due to different accidents by roof/side falls and poor performance of structures. It is the main stage of production

## Mining accident
A mining accident is an accident that occurs during the process of mining minerals or metals. Thousands of miners die from mining accidents each year, especially from underground coal mining, although accidents also occur in hard rock mining.Coal mining is considered much more hazardous than hard rock mining due to flat-lying rock strata, generally incompetent rock, the presence of methane gas
