## Use Of Cone Crusher In Construction - Bright Hub Engineering
The cone crusher is a machine used in the construction industry for crushing different varieties of rocks and ores of varying hardness. Cone crushers have a stable structure, an efficient and simple adjustment, and are used extensively. The crusher functions by pushing on substances held between the fixed cone and the movable cone.

## How To Use Two Cones Crushers
All rock crushers can be classified as falling into two main groups. Compressive crushers that press the material until it breaks, and impact crushers using the principle of quick impacts to crush the material. Jaw crushers, gyratory crushers, and cone operate according to the compression principle.
