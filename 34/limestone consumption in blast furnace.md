Prepared iron ore (lump ore, pellets, sinter), coke, and limestone are charged into the top of the BF. A hot air blast (commonly enriched with oxygen) and often an auxiliary reductant (such as coal) are blown through the tuyeres near the bottom of the furnace (Huang and Andrade 2017).The hot air blast reacts with the coke in the burden (and any auxiliary reductant) to form reducing gases
