## What Is Hydraulic Mining - Realonomics
Large mining companies saw the potential for profit if they could find a way to process large quantities of gold bearing gravel in quick order. The process called hydraulic mining or "hydraulicking" became widely used. Hydraulic mining uses high pressure jets of water to dislodge sediment and material for processing.

## Hydraulic Gold Mining - History and Current Use
But hydraulic mining was still widely used in placer gold mines on Alaska in the early 20 th century. Today, hydraulic gold mining is only rarely practiced on an industrial scale, but gold mines on Alaska sometimes use it. It survives mostly in artisanal form in remote, undeveloped and largely unregulated areas of the world.

Hydraulic Mining. Where it is practicable, this is the simplest and most inexpensive method of placer mining. The mechanical equipment requirements consist only of pipe lines and giants. One feature, however, that is frequently overlooked in hydraulic mining is the matter of dumping facilities. This should always receive careful consideration.

## What Is Hydraulic Mining - Realonomics
Hydraulic mining was a variation on ground sluicing where the water delivered to the site would be shot through a nozzle at high pressure onto the face of the cliff thereby washing away tons of boulders gravel dirt and in the hopes of the miners ounces of gold.. Why is hydraulic mining bad? The hydraulic mining technique ruined fertile lands and caused fights between miners and farmers.
