## The Calculation of Roll Force and Torque in Hot Rolling Mills
Abstract. Equations are derived for the normal roll pressure, specific roll load and torque in hot rolling mills, using the condition for plastic deformation in rolling derived by Orowan, together with von Kármán's equation of equilibrium. Although applying strictly to the rolling of ideal plastic-rigid materials, these equations may be

## Chatter problems on a cold rolling mill - Innoval Technology
These defects were present in all the mill work rolls and were likely created during the chocking and de-chocking operations. Reconditioning the bearing races and improving the chocking operation eliminated the strip markings. Therefore the plant could, once again, manufacture products from its cold rolling mill with the highest surface quality.

In this configuration, there are two horizontally mounted rolls. The rolling mill motor drives either both rolls (top and bottom) or only one roll (normally the bottom roll) with the top roll rotating due to the friction between the roll and the work piece.

The production of sheet and strip material uses flat rolling techniques. Material is passed through the gap between two parallel, hardened steel rolls. The rolls rotate and pull the material into the roll gap, squeeze it so that the thickness of the material is reduced, and push the thinner material out the exit side of the roll gap.

In simple terms, cold rolling is the process of strengthening steel by changing its shape without using heat. Cold rolling, unlike hot rolling such as with hot rolled steel, can only occur when a metal is below its re-crystallization temperature. Where hot rolling is performed using high temperatures, cold rolling is performed at room temperature.

## 3 Roll Bending Machine (Working Principle and Rolling Process)
The following is the working principle drawing of symmetrical 3-roll bending machine. Driven roller Ⅱ, Ⅲ is driven by motor and reducer, which rotates in the same direction at the same speed (or in the opposite direction). Because of the friction between the roller and the plate, the plate is driven forward and the roller is rotated.
