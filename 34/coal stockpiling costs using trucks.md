When the stockpile dozer has a full blade of coal, the volume of coal may fill the draw down hole and reduce the risk. If there is little or no coal in front of the blade, the risk of the dozer going down into the draw down void increases. The dimensions of the dozer and the stockpile height influence the risk.
