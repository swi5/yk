It consists mainly of alumina and silica and has a higher LOI than Class C fly ash. Class F fly ash also has a lower calcium content than Class C fly ash. Replacement When used in portland cement, Class F fly ash can be used as a portland cement replacement ranging from 20-30% of the mass of cementitious material.

## Fly Ash as a Cementitious Material for Concrete - IntechOpen
Fly ash is considered as one of the largest generated industrial solid wastes or so-called industrial by-products, around the world particularly in China, India, and USA. The characteristics of fly ash allow it to be a geotechnical material to produce geopolymer cement or concrete as an alternative of ordinary Portland cement.

## Fly Ash Topic - American Concrete Institute
Fly ash is a by-product from the combustion of pulverized coal, and is widely used as an ingredient in hydraulic-cement concrete. Because it improves many desirable properties of concrete, it is introduced either as a separately batched material or as a component of blended cement. Fly ash reacts with the hydrating hydraulic cement to form a cementing medium.
