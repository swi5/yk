Water Pollution . Mining also causes water pollution which includes metal contamination, increased sediment levels in streams, and acid mine drainage. Pollutants released from processing plants, tailing ponds, underground mines, waste-disposal areas, active or abandoned surface or haulage roads, etc., act as the top sources of water pollution.

## What are the 3 environmental impacts of mineral extraction?
What are the environmental impacts of mining iron ore? The mining of iron ore is highly energy intensive and causes air pollution in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from diesel generators, trucks and other equipment. The mining of iron ore also causes water pollution of heavy metals and acid that drains from the mines.

## Metal Mining Pollution: A Serious Threat to Maine
Mining metals in deposits with high levels of sulfides, which are common in Maine, is especially dangerous. Mining companies search for metals like copper and zinc in deposits where iron sulfide is present in large quantities. Iron sulfide creates acid when exposed to air and water. This acid kills fish and other aquatic creatures.

Metallic sulfide mining (aka hard rock mining) is the practice of extracting metals such as nickel, gold and copper from a sulfide-rich ore body.

Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. The resulting chemicals in the water are sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can come out as solids to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage.

## What are the 3 environmental impacts of mineral extraction?
The mining of iron ore is highly energy intensive and causes air pollution in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from diesel generators, trucks and other equipment. The mining of iron ore also causes water pollution of heavy metals and acid that drains from the mines.

## Pollution From Mining - The World Counts
The water pollution is caused by acid that drains from the "Iron Mountain" mine, known as acid drainage. Acid drainage is serious stuff. With a pH value of 0, the groundwater near the "Iron Mountain" has been found to be 10,000 times more acidic than battery acid (this is VERY acidic). It's the highest concentration of acid in the world.

## Hydraulic mining environmental effectsnd-painting-passion
Mining is the extraction of minerals and other geological materials of economic value from deposits on the Earth. Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes.

Air Pollution. The toxicity of air pollution and dust may vary, but high levels of arsenic, lead, and radionuclides tend to pose the greatest risk. Air pollution occurs at mining sites during excavation and transportation. Blowing dust from AML sites is a common concern, as many mines are in arid western states.
