## grinding of plant extract
- BMC Plant . A non-grinding method is proposed by SIGMA (Extract-N-Amp Plant PCR kit). It is not based on enzymatic digestion of the cell wall and the leaf tissue usually does not appear to be degraded after the treatment with the lysis buffer. The DNA extract is extremely crude, of low DNA content and often contains PCR inhibitors. More

For example if you have 10 grams of cannabis at 15% THC. You take 10g x 15 = 1500 total mg of THC. So there would be a total of 1500mg potential THC. You then would take 1500 and multiply it by .877, which = 1315.5mg of THCa. So after cooking a recipe with 10g of Cannabis at 15%THC you would have a total of 1315.5mg of THCa.

## Plant extraction - Berkem - Extraction végétale
Plant extraction is a process that aims to extract certain components present in plants. It is a solid/liquid separation operation: a solid object (the plant) is placed in contact with a fluid (the solvent). The plant components of interest are then solubilised and contained within the solvent. The solution thus obtained is the desired extract.
