## Mine Planning and Production Guide | Grid - Mining | Grid
The process of mining can be narrowed down to 6 essential steps - Prospecting, Exploration, Planning, Development, Extraction, and Closure.  Prospecting. Prospecting is the first step in mining where a miner searches for the area with possible mineral or ore deposits. Historically, prospecting was done by roaming and visually examining the

Dr Nicola Careddu, ncareddu@unica. Building stone has been extracted from underground in certain parts of Europe for centuries. In the 20th century, stricter legislation has sometimes restricted opencast quarrying with the result that under favourable geological conditions, underground mining is adopted. The economic aspects are paramount.
