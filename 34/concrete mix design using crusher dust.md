## Sand or gravel under concrete slabyrelax.shop
Concrete slabs can develop voids from a variety of reasons, ranging from sliding soil beneath the slab displaced because of a lack of proper compression, to water erosion slowly washing away the soil over time. Voids can lead to a weakness in the slab, causing dips in the surface, tilting or cracks and breaks.

Results are expressed as mass per volume. For example, a given crushed limestone could weigh 93 lbs./ft.3. By knowing the DRUW of a coarse aggregate, the maximum nominal aggregate size and the fineness modulus of the fine aggregate, the weight of the coarse aggregate needed per cubic yard of concrete mix can be estimated.
