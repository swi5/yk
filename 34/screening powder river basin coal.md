## The production of a premium solid fuel from Powder River Basin coal 
This report describes our initial evaluation of a process designed to produce premium-quality solid fuel from Powder River Basin (PRB) coal. The process is based upon our experience gained by producing highly-reactive, high-heating-value char as part of a mild-gasification project. In the process, char containing 20 to 25 wt % volatiles and

The Powder River Basin coal boom started in the 1970s. The biggest mine by production volume, Black Thunder, opened in 1977. The company town of Wright sprang up at nearby Reno Junction, beginning with the 108-unit Cottonwood Mobile Home Park. As of 2012 there are 13 operating coalmines in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming.

The Powder River Basin is the largest source of coal in the U.S., primarily producing thermal coal used for power generation. Unlike eastern U.S. producers, the region has limited economic export opportunities, even when global coal prices are high. Coal production from the area slid about 10.6% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2019.
