## Is there a "magic number" GPM flow rate per ton? - GreenBuildingTalk
Ok. thanks. The manual for the system says that flow rates above 3 gpm per ton can actually cause water velocities in the exchanger that can erode the walls of the exchanger and cause leaks! I didn't know if I should/could throttle down the flow using the manifold in order to get about 3 to 3.5 gpm per ton.

Suggested Pipe Size for Compressed Air Flow at 100 PSI Length of Run, Feet. On a compressed air distribution system, pressure losses greater than 3% are considered excessive, and a well-designed system having a steady rate of air flow is usually designed for not more than a 1% loss or 1 PSI for a 100 PSI system.

Take the time from the watch and round figure up or down to nearest "5." So, if the timer reads 17 seconds, you would round up to 20 seconds. Divide 60 by that number. In the previous example, 60 divided by 20 is 3. The resultant number is the gallons-per-minute or GPM used. The faucet in this example uses 3 GPM.

Mar 14, 2018· Calculate a ton of cooling load using this formula: Cooling load = 500(1 US gal/min)(10 degrees Fahrenheit)/12,000_._ A 1-ton chiller is equal to 12,000 British thermal units. This amount of heat could theoretically melt 1 ton of ice in 24 hours. A cooling tower's job is to reduce the temperature of water through refrigeration.

## How to Calculate BTU's on CHW System - HVAC-Talk: Heating, Air 
You will need the mass flow rate and temperature differential. The formula is Q (BTU/hr) = (Mdot) (Cp) (delta-T). Mdot can be solved for if you gave a GPM value by assuming that the treated chilled water weighs about 8.33 lbm/gal. Converting gallons to mass and coverting the time to hours yields a constant of 499.
