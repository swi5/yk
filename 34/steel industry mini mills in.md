## Solved The development of mini-mills was a | Chegg
This problem has been solved! The development of mini-mills was a disruptive innovation in the steel industry. Before mini-mills, steel production had substantial economies of scale and steel companies had to be very large to take full advantage of those economies. Mini-mills eliminated the advantage of large size in steel production.

## How should steelmakers adapt at the dawn of the EAF mini-mill era in 
China's steel industry is on the cusp of a new era. Over the next decade, steel will increasingly be made by recycling domestic scrap in electric arc furnace (EAF) mini-mills as the government proceeds with policy-driven elimination of conventional induction furnaces (IF), and the replacement of integrated steel capacity.

## Case Study : Nucor Corp, From Bankruptcy To Steel Industry Giant
Continuing our study on steel we have come up with part 3 of the series (Nucor Corp) where we are studying Nucor Steel from the US, Nucor's journey from a very small mini-mill (a steel joist manufacturer) to a steel producer has been incredible. It is a case of how intangible assets in an organization and that to in an industry like steel can make it profitable.
