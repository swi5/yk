## Antimony Gold Ore Extraction
The successful cyanidation of gold ores containing appreciable amounts of arsenic or antimony sulphide minerals such as orpiment, realgar, and stibnite is usually difficult or even impossible.extractions are low and the solutions soon become foul. the gold in such ores could be free and uncoated, and no trouble in dissolving it in clean cyanide solutions would be.

its consumption of cyanide and oxygen [1]. Pre-aeration of ore prior to cyanidation and/or addition of lead nitrate can be beneficial for mitigating problems associated with sulphide minerals during cyanidation of gold [13,14,16].

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

## cyanidation of gold ores containing antimony
Cyanidation Of Gold Ores Containing Antimony. Gold containing antimony ore is a type of refractory gold in which gold is intimately associated with stibnite guo et al., 2017.When the traditional cyanidation method is used for gold extraction, thioantimonate by stibnite decomposition reacts with oxygen to form antimony acid salt, or antimony.

## 4 Extraction Processes for Gold-Pyrite Ore - Mining-pedia
2. The Extraction Processes of Gold-Pyrite Ore. The treatment principle of gold-pyrite ore is to separate the sulfide from the gangue and dissolve the gold in the cyanide solution. In order to remove antimony, arsenic, carbon and other substances that absorb fluoride, roasting treatment is required before cyanidation.
