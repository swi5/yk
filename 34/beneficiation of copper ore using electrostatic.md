Generally, the copper ore is crushed to 0-5mm or 0-9mm, and then grouped by winch or vibrating table: 1) Separation of lean and rich ore. Some sedimentary primary copper oxide ores are depleted due to mining, and heavy media and jigs are used to remove gangue to obtain massive concentrates. 2) Separation of coarse and fine ore.

## Beneficiation process of copper ore - Fodamon Machinery
Beneficiation process of copper ore. Generally use relatively simple processes, through a grinding fineness -200 mesh about 50% to 70%, 1 roughing, 2 or 3 times selected, 1 or 2 times sweep the election. Comparison of disseminated copper minerals, such as small size, may consider the stage of grinding and separation processes.

## How to Beneficiate Oxidized Copper Ores? - JXSC Machine
Sep 8, 2021Separation flotation method can also achieve good results for refractory oxidized copper ore. It is to crush the mineral to a certain particle size, mix 0.1% ~ 1.0% salt and 0.5% ~ 2.0% pulverized coal, and heat it to about 900 ℃ in oxygen isolation. The copper in the ore will precipitate on the carbon particle surface in metal state.
