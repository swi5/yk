The Refining Process. Refiners start with one of two types of gold: a doré bar or scrap. Doré bars are produced by miners and are about 80 percent pure. Refiners increase the purity by separating the other precious metals and less precious metals that are mined with it. Using induction heating, doré bars and scrap are turned into molten metal.

Acid Test: This is a simple test that capitalizes on the reaction of gold with acid to prove its originality. All you have to do is make a slight scratch on the surface and add a small drop of trioxo nitrate (v) acid (HNO3). If the gold does not react with the acid, this is a proof that we're dealing with real gold.

Next. Of all the methods of extracting gold & processing it from its ore, I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study. The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation, cyanidation and gravity concentration. Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.
