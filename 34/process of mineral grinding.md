## Grinding process - Literature
The main objective for a grinding process coupled with a froth flotation is liberation of valuable minerals from their associated gangue. Specifically, the goal is to maximize the exposed mineral surface in order to make froth flotation efficient. In Figure 1 a typical mineral locked into a gangue and a sample breakdown can be seen.

## Process control challenges and opportunities in mineral processing
The mineral content can double in a matter of minutes, changing the flow characteristics dramatically. The processes are complex, with many circulating loads. The operator not only has to think of what is coming, but also what is coming back. Grinding typically has two recirculating streams and flotation can have as many as 10.

## Mineral Processing 101: Tips From Mineral Processing Experts
The objective of mineral processing is to liberate and separate the valuable minerals from the gangue. In order to separate the valuable minerals from the gangue, it is necessary to crush and/or grind the rocks to a size where they are partially or fully exposed, or "liberated". The process of crushing and grinding is referred to as

## Introduction to Mineral Processing or Beneficiation - Sepro Labs
Grinding, the final stage used in the comminution process, is usually conducted in cylindrical tumbling mills where the particle size is reduced through a combination of impact and abrasion. The primary differences between these mills are in the ratio of diameter to the length of the cylinder and the type of grinding media employed.

## mineral grinding process
Grinding is a powdering or pulverizing process using the rock mechanical forces of impaction and attrition. The two main objectives for a grinding process are: To liberate individual minerals trapped in rock crystals (ores) and thereby open up for a subsequent enrichment in the form of separation.
