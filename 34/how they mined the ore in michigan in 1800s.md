## How World War II Affected the Marquette Iron Range
After the Jackson Mining Company began to grow more and more companies formed to seek profit from the mining industry. The Negaunee iron formation has been consistently mined from 1847 till current day. The mine industry flourished and fell, however for the mines to be continually mined for over 150 years is a remarkable feet.

The chemical reaction liquefied the iron and separated it from the other materials. A plaque at the site outlines the history of the furnace. The Sterling works soon began manufacturing ship anchors with their iron, and the business took off.

## Immigration to the Iron Range, | MNopedia
During the early twentieth century, the population of the Iron Range was among the most ethnically diverse in Minnesota. Tens of thousands of immigrants arrived from Finland, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Canada, England, and over thirty other places of origin. These immigrants mined the ore that made the Iron Range famous and built its communities.

Between 1500 and 1800, Bolivia, Peru and Mexico accounted for over 85 percent of world silver production and trade as it bolstered Spanish influence in the New World and elsewhere.

The truly interesting thing is that this Crete script was likely based on the language imitated from the Original People of the world (some call them Atlantians, Ancient Giants, or Lumerians), and if people from Crete came and mined in America, they would have used their own language, yet the Newberry tablet does not exactly resemble their acquired language form.

There is no doubt that copper was mined at Isle Royale thousands of years ago. Most likely this was done by indigenous miners who traded the copper with people who lived far to the south. These early mines found native copper in veins at the surface. They left behind pits and dumps. Mining by Europeans started in the 1800s on both the Keweenaw

The room and pillar method of mining is employed in all salt mines in Michigan, Ohio, and Ontario. The rooms vary in width from 30 to 60 ft and in height from approximately 17 to 40 ft. Pillar size is adjusted so that the extraction or recovery will attain a maximum of 70%. Actual mining is confined completely to the salt bed.

It is a long and narrow peninsula, which even at its center is no more than 20 miles (30km) from the coast. With a land area of only 1376 square miles, the coastline is 258 miles, so the proximity to the sea has historically meant that large parts of the economy and

Copper mining in the Upper Peninsula boomed, and from 1845 until 1887 (when it was exceeded by Butte, Montana) the Michigan Copper Country was the nation's leading producer of copper. In most years from 1850 through 1881, Michigan produced more than three-quarters of the nation's copper, and in 1869 produced more than 95% of the country's copper.
