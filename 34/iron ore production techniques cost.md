Jul 19, 2022Report summary. Our 2021 average total cash cost of Chinese iron ore mines is US$15/tonne higher compared to 2020 due to higher energy costs, strong RMB and higher royalties and levies because of higher iron ore prices in 2021. We expect costs to increase to around US$82/tonne due to higher diesel prices in 2022.

Ferrous metallurgy is the metallurgy of iron and its alloys.The earliest surviving prehistoric iron artifacts, from the 4th millennium BC in Egypt, were made from meteoritic iron-nickel. It is not known when or where the smelting of iron from ores began, but by the end of the 2nd millennium BC iron was being produced from iron ores in the region from Greece to India, and Sub-Saharan Africa.
