Situated on the coast, at Ronez, this quarry was opened in 1902 to supply a grey roadstone. Since that date, thousands of tons of granite chippings have been exported to England for use on roads. Although stronger than the ornamental granite, this grey stone has no natural grain, and is quite unsuitable for special work.
