## 8 Main Cement Ingredients & Their Functions - Civil Engineering
The main features of these cement ingredients along with their functions and usefulness or harmfulness are given below: Lime: Lime is calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide. The presence of lime in a sufficient quantity is required to form silicates and aluminates of calcium. Deficiency in lime reduces the strength of the property to the cement.

High content magnesia makes the cement unsound. Calcium Sulphate ( CaSO4): This ingredients is in the form og gypsum and its function is to increase the initial setting time of cement. Sulphur (S): A very small amount of sulphur is useful in making the sound of cement. If it in excess, it causes the cement to become unsound.

## Explained: Cement vs. concrete — their differences, and opportunities 
Calcium silica hydrates, or CSH, are the key to cement's solidity. As they form, they combine, developing tight bonds that lend strength to the material. These connections have a surprising byproduct — they make cement incredibly porous. Within the spaces between the bonds of CSH, tiny pores develop — on the scale of 3 nanometers.

## Sustainable Building Materials - Geopolymer Concrete
Geopolymer binders and concretes are high-strength and possess a range of specific properties. They are called "geopolymers" because the raw materials used for their production are mainly minerals of geological origin. Geopolymer cement is chemically inert to a range of aggressive substances, and remains sturdy in severe climates.

Classification: High Calcium Marl: CaO ≥ 45% ; Low calcium marl: CaO <45%. In some places, the composition of marl is close to the raw material for making cement. It can be directly fired into cement, which is called natural cement rock. Main mineral is calcite. White peony: also named chalk, it is a mixture of shells and of marine organisms.

Transite originated as a brand that Johns Manville, an American company, created in 1929 for a line of asbestos -cement products, including boards and pipes. In time it became a generic term for other companies' similar asbestos -cement products, and later an even more generic term for a hard, fireproof composite material, fibre cement boards, typically used in wall construction.

The environmental aspects involved in the production and use of cement, concrete and other building materials are of growing importance. CO2 emissions are 0.8-1.3 ton/ton of cement production in dry process. SO2 emission is also very high, but is dependent upon the type of fuel used. Energy consumption is also very high at KWT/ton of
