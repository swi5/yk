## Bauxite Beneficiation: Efficient Way to Remove Silica in Bauxite
The main component of bauxite is Al 2 O 3, containing a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, and other impurities. The main objective of bauxite beneficiation is to lower the concentration of reactive silica, and also to increase the alumina content. In addition, bauxite beneficiation can also be used for iron extraction or iron removal.

Before a bauxite deposit can be mined, it has to be identified and its economic and technical viability demonstrated.

Uranium mining poses even more environmental and even human health problems in Africa. The activity consumes a lot of water. In Arlit, a desert region in northern Niger, the miners claim to use 7 to 10 million m 3 of water per year to process the ore. It is therefore the fossil water tables that are emptied or contaminated.
