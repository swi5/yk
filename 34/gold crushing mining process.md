## Hard Rock Gold Mining - Mineral Processing
The current mainstream hard rock gold mining process is generally crushing, grinding, gravity separation. Through gravity separation and flotation, concentrates and tailings are extracted, or through chemical methods, after smelting, the products finally become finished gold. The type and extent of gold mining depend on the desired product.
