Impact Crushers are best used with softer rock, such as limestone and sandstone, and for recycling processed materials like concrete and asphalt. Impact crushers tend to produce more "fines" than Jaw crushers. Jaw Crushers have two opposing ribbed panels, or jaws, with one jaw moving forward and back to crush raw material against the fixed jaw.
