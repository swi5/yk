## What is Silica? | Crystalline Silica Dust | Silicate Exposure - 360training
Silica is the common name for silicon dioxide (SiO2), a mineral that makes up 59% of the earth's crust by mass. You can find it in soil, sand, granite, concrete, and more than 95% of known rocks on the planet. It comes in two forms: crystalline and non-crystalline (also called amorphous). Crystalline silica is the most dangerous form.

The "dangerous" part of DE is the amount of crystalline silica that is in it. Filter grade is 65% crystalline silica while food grade is less than 1/10 of 1%! The world health org. has said that diatomaceous earth is safe to breathe as long as the crystalline content is under 2%. Food grade is 20X lower than even that level!!".
