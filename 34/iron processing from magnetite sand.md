## Separation, upgrading, and mineralogy of placer magnetite in the black 
The black sand magnetite is a raw material to produce iron and steel. High content magnetite in the top meter beach sands of the north-west of El-Burullus Lake of Egypt is separated and mineralogically and geochemically investigated. Magnetite content obtained by laboratory techniques varies between 2.92 and 0.11 wt%, with 1.15 wt% average. It represents about one third of the total economic

## Banded iron formation - Sandatlas
Banded iron formation consists of layers of iron oxides (typically either magnetite or hematite) separated by layers of chert (silica-rich sedimentary rock). Each layer is usually narrow (millimeters to few centimeters). The rock has a distinctively banded appearance because of differently colored lighter silica- and darker iron-rich layers.

Magnetite is a form of iron oxide, Fe 3 O 4, which possesses uniquely iron in both the Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ oxidation states. Bearing the form of an inverse spinel, it's magnetic properties are highly valued. Addition of magnetite to soil is advantageous as it can later be removed easily by using magnets. It can occur naturally in soil, or be added as a soil treatment agent.

Magnetite is a mineral and one of the main iron ores, with the chemical formula Fe 2+ Fe 3+ 2 O 4.It is one of the oxides of iron, and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. With the exception of extremely rare native iron deposits, it is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth.
