Cadmium occurs naturally in the environment at low levels, usually with zinc, lead and copper ore deposits. It is one of the most toxic industrial and environmental heavy metals because of its long half-life and multifaceted deleterious effects (Domingo, 1994).High cadmium concentrations are often associated with industrial emission sources like mining and smelting operations.

## Current Energy Requirements in the Copper Producing Industries
An analysis of energy usage in the production of refined cathode copper was made from mining ore to cathode copper. In mining copper ore the greatest energy consumers are ore hauling and blasting. Another important factor is the "recovery efficiency" of the metallurgical processes used to extract the copper. The mining and mineral concentrating energies are directly proportional to the
