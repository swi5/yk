## The Environmental Impact of Faux & Natural Stone
And while natural stone would seem to fit the bill, it's important to keep in mind that stone quarrying has both aesthetic and environmental impacts on the earth, including erosion. It can also require a good deal more energy to transport to job sites because of its weight. Plus, as a natural product, it's also a finite resource.

## Is Quartz Sustainable? An Honest Look at the Facts
Quartz, therefore, is a nice compromise. It has the look of stone, but it functions much more like a solid surface. In fact, quartz is nearly indestructible. It is not prone to cracking or scratching. Moreover, the surface is not porous like natural stone. Therefore, it will not stain, and it is very easy to clean.

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Mining Industry?
Mining is the extraction of minerals and other geological materials of economic value from deposits on the Earth. Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes.
