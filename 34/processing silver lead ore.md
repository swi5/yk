##  Lead and Zinc - Energy
6.1 Process Overview 6.1.1 Lead and Zinc Ore Mining Lead and zinc ore is nearly always mined below the surface of the ground. Some veins of ore lie as deep as several thousand feet but most deposits lie close to the surface. Lead and zinc ore is mined almost exclusively in underground operations, though a few surface operations do exist.

## Silver mining
Ore processing. Once removed from the mine, silver-containing ore is crushed (commutation) into a fine powder to expose individual grains to chemical processing.As a byproduct of mining of lead and copper, silver ores are often purified by froth flotation.After froth flotation, silver is extracted by a cyanide process, akin to technology used for gold extraction.

More than 100 years later, ore is still being mined from the Broken Hill deposit and it has been the largest producer of lead-zinc-silver in Australia.  In the Northern Territory, the large McArthur River deposit is a major lead producer. Lead ore also is produced at Rosebery in Tasmania, and Elura in New South Wales.

## Lead Mining - Concentration process, flotation, filtering, roasting 
Lead is extracted from ores dug from under-ground mines. Lead is also found in conjunction with other metals such as silver and zinc. Lead materials are mined as a by- product of these other more valuable metals. Extracting the lead materials from the ore is a tedious process. First the lead ore is ground into small salt-like particles.

The ore has first to be separated from clays and other silicates ('gangue') after which the lead ore and the zinc ore are separated. The process used is froth flotation, a succession of stages each delivering a greater concentration

## How is Silver Mined? - APMEX
Silver also occurs alongside lead, copper and zinc ores, which is why nearly 50% of mined Silver today is obtained when processing other kinds of ore. Silver is separated from this ore using a chemical process known as smelting. To begin a new Silver mine, a system of multi-layered crosscuts are made.

## Extracting Lead Materials from Ore
Usually, lead is found in conjunction with other metals such as silver and zinc. Lead materials are mined as a by product of these other more valuable metals. Extracting the lead materials from the ore is a multi-step process. First the lead ore is ground into small particles that are less than 0.1mm, giving the ore a texture similar to table salt.
