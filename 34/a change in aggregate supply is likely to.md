## Aggregate Supply - Meaning, Long-run, Short-run Curve & Shifts
Aggregate supply (AS) depicts the total output of goods and services generated at a given time and price. It is a measure of economic production. The two types are long-run and short-run aggregate supply. It consists of four main components: labor force, capital, natural resources, entrepreneurial ability, and technological progress.

## Adverse Economic Shocks: Examples, Impacts, Solutions - Penpoin
An adverse supply shock occurs when aggregate supply changes dramatically and has negative consequences. Usually, it is identified with negative shocks. Negative shocks cause aggregate output to fall. And at the same moment, it also causes the price level to rise (inflation soars). This situation leads to what we call stagflation.

Aggregate Goods and Services Equilibrium and Changes. Before listing these, it is important to keep in mind that a change in the price level alone will not move the short run aggregate supply curve, because changes in the price level are built into the curve; the curve already indicates to us how various price levels will affect the quantity of goods and services produced in the short run.

Fiscal policy affects aggregate demand through changes in government spending and taxation. Those factors influence employment and household income, which then impact consumer spending and investment. Monetary policy impacts the money supply in an economy, which influences interest rates and the inflation rate.

Refer to Figure 2.2. Again, the variables that are likely to effect supply or demand are listed. The presumed direction of

## PART I: Multiple Choice - Cornell University
The aggregate supply curve is likely to be nearly vertical for output levels close to capacity because (a) interest rates are very high and therefore investment will be decreasing (b) aggregate demand is high (c) at output levels close to capacity the additional cost of producing more output is likely to be very high
