## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview - IntechOpen
Iron ore and iron ore pellets are important sources of iron for manufacturing steel. The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years, owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries, such as China and India. However, the content of iron ore in deposits has deteriorated and low-grade iron ore has been processed.

## Iron Ore Pellet Production - FEECO International Inc.
Pellets are a high-grade source of iron ore and are produced via a type of agitation agglomeration (wet granulation or tumble-growth agglomeration) known as pelletizing, and referred to in the iron ore sector as "balling.". The balling process is carried out utilizing either a rotary drum or disc pelletizer - otherwise known as a balling
