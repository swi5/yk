## CBG Bauxite (Aluminium Ore) Mining Operations
Bauxite processing Treatment of the run-of-mine bauxite consists mainly of crushing and drying before shipment. Ore wagons are tipped individually, the material being crushed to -100mm before stockpiling. After reclaim using bucket-wheel stacker-reclaimers, the ore is dried from an average of 12.5% moisture to 6.7% for shipping.
