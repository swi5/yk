## Coal mining and transportation - Energy Information Administration
Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

A Short Overview and Analysis. Coal is one of the most important commodities for Indonesia in terms of state revenue as it accounts for about 85 percent of the country's total mining revenue. Therefore, when global coal prices fell sharply from 2011 (amid a slowing global economy), Indonesia felt the impact. In a response to lower coal prices

Indonesia has significant coal and mineral deposits, with the majority of Indonesia's mining exports being thermal coal. Indonesia's close proximity to the large energy-consumption nations of China, India, Japan and Korea, coupled with low-cost production, have resulted in Indonesia being ranked as one of the world's largest exporters of thermal coal.

In Indonesia, coal has long been exploited to satisfy the avarice of those in power. Prior to the country's independence, in 1861, the Dutch colonial government began mining coal in Palaran, East Kalimantan, before kicking off production in Ombilin, West Sumatra, in 1892. In fact, Kalimantan and Sumatra islands are Indonesia's 'supermarket' of coal. As of 2020, coal reserves on the two islands
