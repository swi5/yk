## What are the Parts of a Conveyor Belt?
Main Components. A conveyor system is essentially comprised of three main parts: the belt support, the driving unit, and the pulley system. First, the belt support is a part that enables the belt to draw properly. It also supports and strengthens the belt, allowing it to withstand the weight of the materials it needs to transport.

## Belt Conveyor - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A troughed belt conveyor consists of a wide belt typically running on three idler rolls. The outer wing rollers are sloped upwards to form the trough shape. The troughed belt then travels over the idler sets to transport the load. A conventional troughed belt conveyor has the following components: • Idlers.

## Consider High-Speed Belt Conveyors | Chemical Processing
Allowable tolerances are substantially tighter for high-speed belt conveyor components than for their equivalent low-speed counterparts. In particular, to reduce vibration and noise and extend idler life, idler "total indicated runout" should not exceed 0.4 mm in the speed range of 6-9 m/s. Meeting such a tight tolerance is a great challenge.

A conveyor pulley is a mechanical device used to change the direction of the belt in a conveyor system, to drive the belt, and to tension the belt.Modern pulleys are made of rolled shells with flexible end disks and locking assemblies. Early pulley engineering was developed by Josef Sitzwohl in Australia in 1948 and later by Helmuth Lange and Walter Schmoltzi in Germany
