silver is much more soluble in zinc than in lead; silver/zinc alloys have higher melting points than pure zinc. At 863 K zinc is removed by transferring the lead to a 'dezincing kettle'. At this stage the desilvered lead contains about 0.6% zinc and 0.0004% silver. Dezincing is carried out by vacuum distillation at 860 K when the zinc vaporises.
