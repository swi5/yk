Three marls, each with slightly different characteristics, were substituted as road base for crushed stone. One of the marls was also stabilized with ordinary portland cement. Detailed monitoring was then undertaken periodically to determine their performance. The road pavement was constructed on an embankment to ensure good drainage.
