## hot and cold conveyor belt splicing - KOOKS
Cold splicing conveyor belt Cold splicing can be used for most conveyor belt applications. Depending on several factors, cold splicing can be the best choice in some cases. Cold splicing your conveyor belt can be more economical and practical than hot splicing, and can be a good solution for low tension operations without hot conveyed materials

A critical area of importance on any conveyor system is the splice, and in most applications there are two preferred types of splicing method: mechanical splicing, which joins belt ends by metal hinges or plates; and vulcanized splicing, which joins belt ends through heat and/or chemicals. Understanding the pros and cons of each method is

## Splicing Materials - Fenner
Quality splicing materials for conveyor belts. The belt splice is the weakest point in an operating conveyor belt. So the integrity of the splice is critical to minimising the risk of downtime. A strong belt splice relies on two, equally important factors: the skill of the operator; and the quality of the splicing materials being used.

## Vulcanizing conveyor belt splices: hot or cold - Martin Eng
In hot vulcanization, a special press applies both heat and pressure to the splice to cure the intermediary and cover materials into a high-strength joint. The press applies pressure consistently across all surfaces. Pressure can range from 34 to 1200 kilopascal (5 pounds per square inch to 175 per square inch), depending on the belt.
