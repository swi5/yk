Thus, by using this method of energy audit of coal handling plant we can find out the actual losses, method to rectify them and actual cost of the coal lost. In form of dust = 5 Kg = 5x 3.21. = 16.05 /-. Theft loss in wagon = Amount of coal feed in wagon = 100 ton. Amount of coal lest at last when it reaches the power plant = 70 ton.
