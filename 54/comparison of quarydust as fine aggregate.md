Abstract. This study tried to compare the flexural strength of concrete made with riversand and quarry dust as fine aggregate.River sand was collected from Osogbo, Osun State, replaced at 0-100% at intervals of 10% with quarry dust gotten from Wasimi, Osun State, Nigeria.Abstract Common river sand is expensive due to the excessive cost of transportation from natural sources.

## Seminar Report On Quarry Dust As Fine Aggregate In Concrete
Feb 13, 2011 This paper present a report on the possibility of developing high performance concrete (HPC) using quarry dust as part of fine aggregates. Quarry dust was used to replace 20% of sand in silica fume-quarry dust (SFQD) and silica fume (SF) concretes. Besides, silica fume was used as 10% replacement of cement in both SF and SFQD concretes.

## Study on Compressive Strength of Quarry Dust as Fine Aggregate in Concrete
Quarry dust satisfies the reason behind the alternative material as a substitute for sand at very low cost. It even causes burden to dump the crusher dust at one place which causes environmental pollution. From the results of experimental investigations conducted, it is concluded that the quarry dust can be used as a replacement for fine aggregate.

##  An Experimental Study on Quarry Dust as a Fine Aggregate for  - IJSER
fine aggregate with stone dust is found to be 8 to 10%. 5. Effective utilization of quarry dust in concrete can save the waste of quarry works; and also produces a greener concrete. 6. The further increasing the percentage of replacement can be made useful by adding the fly ash along with the quarry dust so that 100%
