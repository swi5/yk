## The Working Principle Of A Jaw Crusher - Editors Top
The working principle of the jaw crushers is very simple. Powered by a diesel or gas motor, the jaw crusher brakes materials in a crushing chamber. The materials are pushed inside the chamber from the top opening and when crushed they are released through the bottom opening. The crushing power of the jaw crushers depends on the size of the chamber.
