12.5 Iron And Steel Production - US EPA. The molten iron and slag are removed, or cast, from the furnace periodically. The casting process begins with drilling a hole, called the taphole, into the clay-filled iron notch at the base of the hearth. During casting, molten iron flows into runners that lead to transport ladles.

Iron Ore Coke 770kg - BHP. The coke is then added to a blast furnace with iron ore. Hot air and PCI are introduced, creating a ˚lame temperature over 2000ºC. The burning coal and coke produces carbon monoxide, which, along with the high temperature, converts the iron ore into a liquid. This molten 'pig iron' is transported to a steel

## Characterising the Blasting Properties of Iron Ore - AusIMM
Most iron ores occur in mine benches as complex mixtures of lithologies and ore types. This significantly complicates their characterisation for both blast design and fragmentation modelling. A great deal of technical and research effort has been applied to the development of models to predict fragmentation from rock blasting. A number of quite useful engineering models are currently available

The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon content (less than 0.08%) in contrast to that of cast iron (2.1% to 4%). It is a semi-fused mass of iron with fibrous slag inclusions (up to 2% by weight), which gives it a "grain" resembling wood that is visible when it is etched, rusted, or bent to the point of failure..

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
