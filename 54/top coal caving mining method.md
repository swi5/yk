Under the hydraulic roof support, coal is cut with shearer and the broken cut coal is loaded by armored face conveyor (AFC) to the belt conveyor which is parallel to the face advance (Brady and Brown, 1985). Longwall top coal caving (LTCC) is a comparatively new method for mining thick coal seams.

Longwall top coal caving (LTCC) is a relatively new method of mining thick coal seams that is currently achieving high productivity and efficiency in application, particularly in China. The technique is similar to traditional longwall mining in that a cutting head slices coal from the lower section of the coal seam onto a conveyor belt [.]

The preferred mining method for these thick coal seams is the Longwall Top Coal Caving (LTCC). The connection of both the top coal caving and its compactness are still rare; therefore, the capability of top coal caving mechanism is the most significant factor in LTCC that must be adequately explained and examined.
