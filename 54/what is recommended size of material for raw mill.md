## Importance of Raw Milk Quality on Processed Dairy Products
Generally, SPC values should be less than 10,000/ml. The legal maximum for producer milk is 100,000/ml. Extremely high counts in raw milk (e.g., due to poor cooling) can cause defects in raw milk that result in its rejection, due to off-odors and flavors such as sour, malty, or rancid. These and other microbial defects can carry over into products.
