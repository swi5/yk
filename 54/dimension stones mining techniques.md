Relation to Mining IMAR 7th Edition Dimension Stone is produced from quarrying. Quarry operations typically involve isolating a mass of stone by cutting it free from the parent mass on all sides but one. The isolated mass is then lifted or separated from the parent mass by breaking it free or by undercutting it with a wire or chain saw.
