## Limestone quarry, quarrying, cement raw materials
Quarrying. Most of the raw materials used are extracted from the earth through mining and quarrying and can be divided into the following groups: lime (calcareous), silica (siliceous), alumina (argillaceous), and iron (ferriferous). Since a form of calcium carbonate, usually limestone, is the predominant raw material, most plants are situated

Mining is usually a permitted use in the Industrial District. If zoned in the Agricultural District, a Special or Conditional Use Permit for Mining, with or without blasting, may be required. Quarrying solid rock, like limestone and granite, requires blasting, whereas mining sand and gravel generally does not.

Crushed stone is used for concrete aggregate, for road building, and, in the case of limestone, as flux in blast furnaces and for chemical applications. The quarrying technique consists of drilling and blasting to fragment the rock. A large number of charges are fired at one time, producing up to 20,000 tons of broken stone in one blast.
