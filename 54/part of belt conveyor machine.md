## Conveyors | Types and Uses of Industrial Conveyors - Ultimation
Conveyor types, categories and uses. Industrial conveyors have many different designs and uses. Common types are belt, roller, motorized roller and overhead conveyors. We categorize them as floor style (mounted on the floor) or overhead. Use them to move products, create buffers and deliver products in sequence for a production line.

## The working principle and characteristics of belt conveyor
Feb 19, 2021The belt conveyor is a conveyor belt that is supported by upper and lower rollers as a bearing member and a traction member. It bypasses the head and tail rollers to form a closed-loop conveyor. It transmits power by means of the friction between the driving roller and the conveyor belt. Realize material transportation.
