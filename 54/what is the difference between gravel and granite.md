Aug 30, 2022Sealing: Granite is a relatively porous stone that requires sealing upon installation, then periodic sealing on an ongoing basis. Quartz, on the other hand, does not require sealing, thanks to the resins used in the fabrication of the slabs. Cracking: Granite slabs may have inherent flaws that make them prone to cracking.

## What is the difference between Granite and Caesarstone?
Key Difference: There are a few key differences between Granite and Caesarstone. For starters, Granite is a natural stone that is quarried from the earth, while Caesarstone is a manufactured quartz product. Granite is also available in a wider range of colors than Caesarstone, and it typically costs less per square foot.
