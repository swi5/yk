## Quarrying and Fabricating Limestone - Concrete Construction
Limestone's volume changes because, as it is quarried, the stone decompresses. Seasoned stone blocks are cut and fabricated to size. Because of its natural uniformity of composition, texture, and structure, Indiana limestone can be shaped and textured by machine-planing or hand-chiseling in any direction. Limestone can be finished with sandpaper.

The Effects Of Limestone Quarrying On The River Ribble. Quarries are mainly used for the extraction of raw materials for construction. Limestone is amongst a list of rock that can be excavated, with many of the quarried stones removed as larger slabs before being cut into smaller tiles, polished and being used in either industrial or residential properties.
