## copper extraction and purification - chemguide
Copper can be extracted from non-sulphide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulphuric acid to produce a very dilute copper (II) sulphate solution. Concentration of the copper (II) sulphate solution by solvent extraction.

## How is copper extracted?s
What is the process of extracting copper? First, the ore is treated with dilute sulphuric acid. This trickles slowly down through the ore, over a period of months, dissolving copper to form a weak solution of copper sulphate. The copper is then recovered by electrolysis. This process is known as SX-EW (solvent extraction/electrowinning).

The most common ore used in copper extraction is Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), also recognized as Copper Pyrites and other such sulfides. The proportion of copper in the real ore is too limited for straightforward copper extraction to be feasible. The concentration of ore is required, and the Froth Flotation method is used for this process.
