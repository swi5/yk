Abstract— The study reports on experimental investigation on the suitability of the use of broken tiles as partial replacement for crushed granite in concrete production. Control mixing ratio of 1:2:4 batched by weight with water - cement ratio of 0.55 was used. The percentage replacement varied from 0% to 40% at intervals of 5%.
