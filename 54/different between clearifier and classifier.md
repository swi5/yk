## Difference Between Purifier and Clarifier
The key difference between purifier and clarifier is that the purifier consists of a dam ring to create a line of separation between fuel and water whereas the clarifier consists of a sealing ring to prevent the fuel tank from water and dissolved impurities.

In water treatment, a clarifier is a settling tank used to remove solid waste particles from water. When the clarifier separates the concentrated impurities, the sludge formed by the process discharges from the bottom of the tank.

## Clarifier
Clarifiers are settling tanks built with mechanical means for continuous removal of solids being deposited by sedimentation. A clarifier is generally used to remove solid particulates or suspended solids from liquid for clarification and/or thickening. Inside the clarifier, solid contaminants will settle down to the bottom of the tank where it is collected by a scraper mechanism.

generally, uv filters that people call 'sterilizers' are of a higher wattage (40 W, 60W) compared to 'clarifiers' (which can be 5W, 9W, 18W). But this is only a very rough guideline. For example, a 25W sterilizer in a small sized pond (say 1000 gallons), will only be able to act as a clarifier in a bigger pond (for example 4000 gallons).
