## conclusion of magnetic separation
Discussion and Conclusion  This form of physical separation works because even though the components are mixed together, they retain their own characteristics, so iron remained magnetic even though it was a part of the mixture. Another method of physical separation that we used to separate the sand, salt, and iron mixture was filtration.

## Magnetic separation
Magnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using a magnet to attract magnetic substances. The process that is used for magnetic separation separates non-magnetic substances from those which are magnetic. This technique is useful for the select few minerals which are ferromagnetic (iron-, nickel-, and cobalt-containing minerals) and paramagnetic.

In the actual magnetic separation machine, the magnetic field strength ranges from hundreds of Gauss to 20,000 Gauss, some even exceed 20,000 Gauss, but it is rarely used in general beneficiation production. Excessive magnetic field strength will lead to weak magnetic minerals to agglomerate that is not conducive to beneficiation.

Magnetic Separators have a wide application in dry separation processes, frequently in conjunction with High Tension Separation. Dry processes can frequently be superior to established processes in more commonplace mineral associations. A system of dynamics is postulated and the forces operating ar'e examined, together with a method of evaluating the effect of operating variables.

## Magnetic Separation | Magnetic Sorting - BD Biosciences
This cell separation technique utilizes the potential to label cell surface markers with magnetic bead-tagged antibodies and the ability of a magnetic field to migrate the labeled particles from a distance. 1 This controlled migration by a magnetic force (magnetophoresis) is invaluable in separating heterogeneous cell populations and is the basis for magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS).

## Magnetic Separation: The Basics
Magnetic separation is the process of separating magnetic materials from non-magnetic materials using a magnetic system. After World War II, this process became popular in scrap yards to separate metal particles from vehicles; however, the process is more sophisticated than that. In fact, one of the major benefits of magnetic separation is that
