## High Intensity Magnetic Separation of Scheelite
At present, the coarse separation of scheelite is usually by gravity separation or flotation. Because scheelite is a kind of ore which is easy to be gravity-dressed, but because scheelite has fine dissemination size, it needs to be grinded to 0.2 mm before the basic monomer dissociation, thus increasing the difficulty of gravity recovery, and the recovery rate of gravity-dressing is low, the

## Minerals | Free Full-Text | Interaction Forces between Diaspore and 
Molecular force plays an important role in the interaction between collector and minerals, which directly reflects the intrinsic reason for the selectivity and collection of the collector to minerals. In this work, the interaction forces between sodium oleate (NaOL) and minerals (kaolinite and diaspore) were directly characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with EDLVO theory
