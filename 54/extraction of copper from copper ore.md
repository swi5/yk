## USB2 - Process for the extraction of copper from a sulphide 
A process for the extraction of copper from a sulphide ore or concentrate comprises the steps of subjecting the ore or concentrate to pressure oxidation in the presence of oxygen and an acidic solution containing halide and sulphate ions to obtain a resulting pressure oxidation slurry. The slurry is subjected to a liquid/solid separation step to obtain a resulting pressure oxidation filtrate

## Copper extraction - Academic Kids
Currently, the most common source of copper ore is the mineral chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), which accounts for about 50% of copper production.The focus of this article is on the process of copper extraction from chalcopyrite ore into pure metal. Processes for other minerals are mentioned. For economic and environmental reasons, many of the byproducts of extraction are reclaimed.

In the extraction of copper from its sulphide ore, when ore is subjected to roasting, some of it is oxidised to C u 2 O which reacts with the remaining C u 2 S (sulphide ore) to give copper metal. C u 2 S + 2 C u 2 O → 6 C u + S O 2 ↑ Here C u 2 S behaves as reducing agent.

The techniques for extraction of copper from oxidized ores are quite different from those employed for the sulfide ores. The oxidized ores, consisting of the silicates, carbonates and sulfates, are treated by several methods, all involving some form of leaching of the crushed ore with sulfuric acid to produce impure solutions of copper sulfate.

Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace. The major steps in the extraction of copper are. Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulphide. Just like in Blast Furnaces, calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.

In the extraction of copper from its sulphide ore, when ore is subjected to roasting, some of it is oxidised to Cu 2 O which reacts with the remaining Cu 2 S (sulphide ore) to give copper metal. Cu 2 S +2Cu 2 O → 6Cu +SO 2 ↑ In this process, Cu 2 S behaves as reducing agent.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
Copper oxides are more abundant near the surface, but are considered low-grade ore, with a lower concentration of copper. Although this requires more ore to be extracted and processed, this process is less expensive, so oxides can still be mined at a profit. On the other hand, while copper sulfide ores are less abundant, they contain higher

· An aluminum core is compressed with a sheath of copper, so that both form an inseparable unit. Thus, the positive properties of electrically high conductivity copper can be optimally combined with the light weight of aluminum . Advantages.

## Extraction of copper from complex carbonaceous sulfide ore by direct 
Nov 1, 2021A gradual increase in copper extraction was noted when the temperature was increased from 100 to 160 °C, during which a temperature increase of 20 °C, accordingly yielded an increase of about 20% in copper extraction. However, a further increase in temperature to 180 °C, did not yield a significant improvement in copper dissolution.
