## Stochastic analysis and maintenance planning of the ash handling system 
In modern thermal power plants, in generating 110 MW of electricity about 400 tonnes of ash is produced and the handling of such a huge amount of ash is a great problem in the plant. Only 20% of the total ash is collected at the bottom of the furnace and the remaining goes along the flue gases, polluting the atmosphere.

Around 92 per cent of India's thermal power plants (TPPs) are designed to operate on Indian coal, which has a high ash content compared to the imported coal, which has a lower ash content. On an average, the Indian coal has an ash content of 30-45 per cent compared to imported coal, which has an ash content of 10-20 per cent.

## Coal Ash Basics | US EPA
Mar 6, 2022Coal ash, also referred to as coal combustion residuals or CCRs, is produced primarily from the burning of coal in coal-fired power plants. Coal ash includes a number of by-products produced from burning coal, including: Fly Ash, a very fine, powdery material composed mostly of silica made from the burning of finely ground coal in a boiler.
