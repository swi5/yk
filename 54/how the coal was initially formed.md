## Graphene News and Updates
Initially, our activities were focused on graphene-enhanced carbon-fibre composite materials, but that's since widened to projects on coatings, textiles, printed electronics and energy storage. So it's giving us that toolkit to develop and test our materials in wide-ranging applications.

1) Coal beds do form rapidly by catastrophic destruction of forests, unlike the slow and gradual growth of peat from plants in swamps. 2) Sedimentary layering does form very rapidly by catastrophic flow processes. 3) Mount St. Helens demonstrates beyond debate that the sudden release of water cuts canyons rapidly, even carving through hard rock.

Please note that Coal is also known from an era where there were no land plants such as from Precambrian strata. This coal is presumed to have originated from residues of algae. The Hit's law says that in a small area, the deeper the coal, the higher its rank (grade). The law holds true if the thermal gradient is entirely vertical, however

Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years. Can we make coal at home?

Coal is usually classified into subgroups known as anthracite, bituminous, lignite, and peat. The physical, chemical, and other properties of coal vary considerably from sample to sample. Origins of coal Coal is often referred to as a fossil fuel. That name comes from the way in which coal was originally formed.

Overlaying of sediments over the burial results in the formation of fossil fuels due to exposure to high pressure for a very long period of time. The 3 main types of Fossil Fuels are Coal, Oil & Natural Gas. Natural coal is formed due to the burial of plants and animals. Petroleum and natural gas are a result of the buried marine life.

## OKD | How coal was formed
How coal was formed. Coal was formed in Paleolithic era ecosystems ( lake basins, river deltas or low lying areas ) and is made of the material of prehistoric plants. Initially, through solar energy they produced hydrocarbons from air, water and mineral matters. Upon decay they sank into the swamps which were environments without oxygen.

These two conditions - the patented 'hard calcination' process of creating coal and the burial of so many trees - is the key to understanding how coal is formed.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.
