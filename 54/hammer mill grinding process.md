What is Hammer Milling? Hammer milling is a high energy process of reducing particle size (comminution) by impact with rapidly moving hammers. The material is fed into the mill's chamber through a feed chute, typically by gravity, where it is struck by rapidly rotating hammers that strike particles repeatedly until the particles are reduced to a size that can pass through a nearby screen.

## How Does a Hammer Mill Work? - SlideShare
3. Hammer mills work in the principle that most materials will crush, shatter, or pulverize upon impact. 4. The Process: Material is fed into the mill grinding chamber through the feed chute, typically by gravity. It repeatedly is struck by ganged hammers which are attached to a shaft which rotates at high speed inside the mill chamber.

"In that manner, specific energy consumption of the grinding process will be lower, the share of coarse (>1600 μm) and fine particles (<400 μm) in the pellets will be lower, and also the quality of pellets will be better, compared to processes using a hammer mill in the grinding stage," concluded the team.

A hammer mill is a single-passage-type mill that has sets of hammers (generally rectangular pieces of hardened steel) spaced equally and attached to a rotating shaft that rotates at high speed using a powerful electric motor inside a grinding chamber. The leading face of the hammers may be blunt or sharp to create different impact or shearing

This grinding process is appropriate for wet raw material. The capacity ranges from a few hundred kilograms up to 40 tonnes per hour and more. Appropriate for G30 and G50 wood chips pre-grinding for trouble-free fine grinding in traditional hammer mills.

## Hammer mills : what is it ? How it works
The 2nd key design and operational aspect for a hammer mill is the rotation speed. As the milling principle is based on the energy of the impact, the higher the speed, the finer the product can be expected as the particles will heat the hammer at high speed, but also be sent against each other or against the screen at high speed.
