Soil mining and gravel extraction is a common activity in United States of America. A publication by Schaetzl (1990) showed that historically, from 1920s many states in USA relied on mining of gravel and sand for road and cement aggregate. The uses had doubled by 2008 to date. Sand and gravel are mined more than all other minerals in most
