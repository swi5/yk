## Cement Manufacturing Process - Sanghi cement
Cement manufacturing process involves various raw materials and processes. Cement is a greenish grey coloured powder, made of calcined mixtures of clay and limestone. When mixed with water becomes a hard and strong building material.  The size of the clinker is varies from 5-10mm. The clinker coming from the burning zone are very hot. To

## What are the Types of Cement Clinker - Construction Cost
Clinker is a nodular material which is produced in the kilning stage during the production of cement. It is used as a binder in many cement products. Clinker nodules are around 3-25 mm in diameter and dark grey in colour. Limestone and clay is heated to about 1400oC-1500oC in the rotary kiln to produce clinker.

## Q&A: Why cement emissions matter for climate change
A further 40% of cement emissions come from burning fossil fuels to heat kilns to the high temperatures needed for this calcination process. The last 10% of emissions come from fuels needed to mine and transport the raw materials. Therefore, cement emissions depend largely on the proportion of clinker used in each tonne of cement.

A typical raw mix consists of 75-85% limestone, 12-25% shale, the balance consisting of silica or quartzite and iron oxide.
