## stone screening sizes
Stone size and sieve size are related (the sieve size is basically the minimum size the stone can be), but a stone size is actually an allowable range of sizes. For example, for a #4 stone, will pass through a 50mm or 2inch sieve (2x2inch or 50x50mm square sieve openings) and at least 95% must be larger than the opening in a #4 sieve.
