Machine molding will require a minimum amount of draft. Interior surfaces in green sand molds usually require more draft than exterior surfaces. The amount of draft recommended under normal conditions is about 3/16 in. per ft (approximately 1.5°). Draft can be eliminated in some cases through special molding techniques.

Sand moulded casting is the simplest and most versatile casting method used to make castings. Sand is the most popular molding material due to its heat receptivity, permeability and low cost. Over 60% of metal casting is done by using sand moulds. Sand moulds are broadly classified into two Green sand moulds and Dry sand moulds.

## Green Sand Mold - Morel Industries
GREEN SAND MOLD The Sand Casting process - aka Green Sand Mold process - is commonly used in the casting of aluminum, brass/bronze, and iron products. The term "green sand" is known principally because of the moisture content within the sand.

The main problem of the spin casting process consists in the poor thermal conductivity of silicone rubber as mold material which leads to a long cooling time between each casting processes and also to a short life time of.  Vacuum impregnating 100 percent of castings after final machining is the best way to ensure leak-free castings at build.

## Sand casting
Sand casting, also known as sand molded casting, is a metal casting process characterized by using sand as the mold material. The term "sand casting" can also refer to an object produced via the sand casting process. Sand castings are produced in specialized factories called foundries.Over 60% of all metal castings are produced via sand casting process.

Green sand molding requires sand to be rammed into flasks with the pattern firmly attached at the center and forms the mold which is then filled with melted metal to form the casting upon solidification. Green Sand Molding predominately used in the foundry and it has the advantage of being continually recycled.

## The difference between green sand casting process and resin sand 
As for the traditional green sand casting process, it only needs sand boxes and workers, so no equipment needed. Today, more and more iron foundries in China use molding machines or automatic molding machines. The resin sand casting process usually needs equipments to mix the resin sand and fill the sands into the sand boxes. 3. Production time

## Ceramic foundry sand for green sand process - Shenghuo
Short Description: Green Sand Castings are castings made using wet sand or "green sand" molds. The sand is not green in color nor do the molds use "greensand," a greenish color sandstone. Instead of the sand is called "green" because it has moisture in it (like green wood) before the sand dries out when molten metal is poured in the
