Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity - known as doré - typically containing between 60-90% gold.

## Nickel mining in Australia - history, top locations and companies - GRT
The rise in nickel mining is attributed to the Kambalda region in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia. Nickel ore grades in the 1960s had 4% nickel but within a decade the nickel ore grade in Australia fell to 2%. Over the last 20 years, low grade laterite or sulphide deposits have posted an average ore grade of about 1.2%.

Based on the mineralogical characteristics and mineral processing techniques required, gold ores can be classified into 12 types, depicted in Figure 6.4. Generally speaking, the first six gold-ore types in Figure 6.4 are more free-milling and the other six ore types are more refractory, and from top to bottom, the refractoriness increases
