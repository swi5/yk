Surface mining（ground mining） is a type of mining in which the soil and rock covering the mineral deposit are removed instead of underground mining, in which the overlying stones are left in place. Surface miner machine（surface mining machines） is essential. The surface mining process is very complicated. 2022. 9.

## Underground Gold Mine Development Sampling & Ore Valuation
This paper is intended, in the light of recent investigations, to call attention to some of the essential features of good practice in sampling and mine-valuation. Mine sampling may be divided broadly into two classes: development-sampling and computation of ore-reserves; and, stope-sampling and estimation of stope-values.

This type of mining makes sense when the mineral is near the surface. If the ore is too far under the surface, the process of strip mining becomes impractical and needlessly damaging to the terrain. Two types of strip mining exist, depending on the amount of ore under the surface, and the surrounding terrain. They are:

Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

Longwall mining is a method of underground mining, usually used in coal mining. The method is fairly basic. A tunnel is created by basically cutting back the coal with a rotating drum and shearers. The coal fragments are then conveyed up to the surface. A series of hydraulic jacks (aka., chocks, are used to support the cavity wall, temporarily).
