It indicates how high-purity cobalt and copper are made from these deposits and suggests how the deposits will be exploited as mining moves down into the sulfide layer. The copper and cobalt ores are found in a 500-million-year-old mountain chain in two zones, weathered oxide deposits that extend to a depth between 70 m and 150 m and

A metal-rich crust. Like manganese nodules, cobalt crusts also represent a very large metal resource in the sea. As the name suggests, the crusts contain a relatively large amount of cobalt compared to deposits on land and to manganese nodules. The largest share of metals in the cobalt crusts, however, consists of manganese and iron.

## cobalt copper sulfide mine
In the copper-nickel-iron sulfide mines of Canada, Australia, Russia, and other regions, cobalt is present in place of nickel in many minerals. Cobalt arsenides, such as smaltite, safflorite, and skutterudite, with the sulfoarsenide cobaltite and the arsenate erythrite, are mined in Morocco and on a much smaller scale in many other countries.

## A Review of Nickel, Copper, and Cobalt Recovery by Chelating Ion 
Copper and cobalt can be found on nickel laterite ores, and cobalt can be found also on copper ores, and many contaminants such as iron, aluminum, and magnesium are associated with these ores. In hydrometallurgical process, a purification step is necessary after leaching due to the presence of these impurities. Chelating resins are more selective for some metals than others, making them more

## Cobalt Deposits in the United States - USGS
Cobalt represents a prime example of a critical mineral resource. Cobalt is primarily used in cathodes for rechargeable batteries and in superalloys for jet turbine engines. Most cobalt is mined as a byproduct of copper or nickel, and recently cobalt prices have increased due to strong demand and limited availability.
