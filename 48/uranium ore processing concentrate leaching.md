## Yellowcake - U3O8 | Description & Production | nuclear-power
Yellowcake, chemically U3O8, is a uranium concentrate powder recovered from leach solutions. Yellowcake is an intermediate step in processing uranium ores and nuclear fuel production. Typically, yellowcake can be obtained through the conventional milling and chemical processing of uranium ore, forming a coarse powder.

The uranium-laden solution is removed from the ore body and the uranium is recovered in a plant on the surface. In this study, a laboratory technique for simulating the underground leaching process was developed and used to determine the effects of leaching variables on the permeability, uranium recovery, and ore aquifer environment.

## uranium ore processing concentrate leaching
Uranium ore concentrate, commonly referred to as U3O8 (uranium oxide) or yellowcake, is the product created when uranium ore has been mined and milled (chemically processed). The fine powder is packaged in steel drums and shipped to refineries for further processing to prepare it for use as fuel in nuclear reactors.

Uranium is obtained by mining uranium containing ore known as pitchblende. The primary chemical form of the mineral concentrate that is recovered by modern mining and beneficiation techniques is triuranium octoxide (U3O8), known as yellowcake. In the mining process, ore is first crushed and ground to a fine powder to produce "pulped" ore.

## uranium processing | Britannica
uranium processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Uranium (U), although very dense (19.1 grams per cubic centimetre), is a relatively weak, nonrefractory metal. Indeed, the metallic properties of uranium appear to be intermediate between those of silver and other true metals and those of the nonmetallic elements, so that it is not valued for structural applications.

## Uranium Ore Processing Concentrate Leaching
Increase Uranium Recovery by Nitric Acid Leaching. May 25, 2017 The procedure investigated for treating the ore consisted of the following: (1) separation by flotation of the carbonaceous and sulfidic components from the ore, (2) leaching the flotation concentrate with nitric acid at 100° to 110° C, (3) leaching the flotation tailings with sulfuric acid, and (4) processing the combined

## US Patent for Leaching of uranium ore Patent (Patent # 4,764,353 issued 
If the ore contains insufficient iron, iron may be added, as metallic iron. Ferric iron plays an important role in the oxidation of tetravalent uranium. It may be considered that the acid leaching of uranium from ores containing uranium in the +IV oxidation state proceeds according to two steps: UO.sub.2 +4H.sup.+ .fwdarw.U.sup.4+ +2H.sub.2 O

## Uranium extraction: the key process J drivers - Sabinet African Journals
encountered flowsheet for uranium processing comprises conventional mining followed by comminution, acid leaching, solid/liquid separation, SX purification and finally precipi-tation/recovery as indicated in Figure 1. A high ore carbonate content, hence high acid consumption, may dictate the use of alkaline leaching, and some guidelines for the
