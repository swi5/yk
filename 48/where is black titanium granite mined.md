The Schluter Jolly covers up the difference between the ½" travertine and the ⅜" granite tiles. Either way, you'll have to slather on extra mortar on the thinner pieces during installation, ensuring the top surface stays level. The difference on the front edge is pretty negligible. A difference in the top level is not as forgiving.

## Titanium - Unique Stone Concepts
Quartz Quartz is a man-made engineered stone surface formed by combining 90% ground quartz (a natural hard mineral) with 8-10% resins, polymers, and pigments. This forms a very hard granite-like surface. How it looks depends on how the quartz is ground: coarsely-ground quartz produces a flecked appearance while finely-ground quartz produces a smooth look.
