In order to decrease the degradation rate of magnesium (Mg) alloys for the potential orthopedic applications, manganese -calcium phosphate coatings were prepared on an Mg-Ca-Zn alloy in calcium phosphating solutions with different addition of Mn 2+ . Influence of Mn content on degradation behaviors of phosphate coatings in the simulated body fluid was investigated to obtain the optimum coating.

## Silico Manganese Manufacturing Process and its different stages
The production process of silico manganese goes through stages such as smelting, and slag formationandreduction. Here is the detailed discussion on the stages: Stage 1: It revolves round heating and pre reduction in the solid state at 1373 K and 1473 K. The manganese oxide content is reduced to manganese monoxide and iron oxides to metallic iron.

The ferromanganese (FeMn) alloy is produced through the smelting-reduction of manganese ores in submerged arc furnaces. This process generates large amounts of furnace dust that is environmentally problematic for storage. Due to its fineness and high volatile content, this furnace dust cannot be recirculated through the process, either.
