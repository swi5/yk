Bauxite is generally extracted by open cast mining, being almost always found near the surface, with processes that vary slightly depending on the location. Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and/or saplings, for inclusion in a seedbank, which

Existing methods of pushback (phase) design are reviewed in the context of "gap" problems, a term used to describe inconsistent sizes between successive pushbacks. Such gap problems lead to suboptimal open pit mining designs in terms of maximizing net present value.

The Alcoa Arkansas Operations is a surface mining operation. Initial production took place in 1952. Mine operations consist of surface workings extending 2,428.00 hectares (5,999.71 acres). There is one known shaft. The mining method is open pit. Mine capacity in 1984 was 3096 mt ore/day with a production unit cost of 16.11 $/mt ore.

Open-pit panel mining has been the normal surface method since the early 1960s. A strip or block of bauxite is exposed and mined, and then another panel is exposed. The first panel is normally refilled with waste rock. Several panels typically were open at the same time to supply the proper blend of ores to meet mill specifications.
