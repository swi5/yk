## Electrostatic Beneficiation of Phosphate Ores: Review of Past Work|
Abstract. Beneficiation of phosphate ores by dry electrostatic processes has been attempted by various researchers since the 1940's. The underlying reasons for developing dry processes for phosphate recovery are the limited amount of water in some arid regions, the flotation chemical costs, and the wastewater treatment costs.

Beneficiation is the technical term describing the industrial process of mechanically separating minerals from each other. No chemical changes to the minerals are made at this point in the mining process. The phosphate ore, or "matrix" as it is called locally, contains three different mineral groups which have to be separated from each other.

## Beneficiation
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.

## Phosphate rock benefication - Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners 
Abstract: This invention provides an improved method for the rougher flotation of phosphate ore using sodium carbonate to control the pH at about 9.6-10.5. The method facilitates improved recovery of phosphate from its ore; in addition the Bone Phosphate of Lime (BPL) of the phosphate concentrate increases, which provides further advantages in

The original concentrator adopts reverse flotation process, but there are some problems such as large reagent consumption, low concentrate grade and low recovery. In order to reduce the cost, through the reverse - direct flotation test of the phosphate ore, the raw ore grade is 22.15%, and the phosphorus concentrate grade is more than 35%.

## USA - Phosphate beneficiation process - Google Patents
In the beneficiation of phosphate ore by the flotation of the siliceous material, the utilization of a condensate of a polyethylene polyamine, having from 10 to 24 carbon atoms, with a fatty acid, fatty acid ester or a fatty acid and an alkylolamine improves the separation of phosphate from silica. This improvement is especially great in the presence of unreacted fatty acid.

## Environmental impact of phosphate mining and beneficiation: review
Phosphorus is common within geological materials. The average continental crust contains 0.27% P 2 O 5. 1 Phosphorus is the primary resources to produce fertilizer and phosphorous-based products. 2 Phosphorus is neither substitutable nor recyclable, therefore, the total demand must be provided through the mining, beneficiation and chemical processing of phosphate ores.

## Ore Dressing Equipment For Lead Ore Professional
Ore flotation process plant process introduction Ore beneficiation plant could be used for processing cooper ore, gold ore, iron ore, zinc lead etc. Each mineral has its special features. Gernerally, the whole ore dressing plant is devided into 3 steps. Step 1 Crushing. Due to the raw ore size is large, it is necessary to be crushed into.
