Bentonite - A flow diagram for bentonite processing is provided in Figure 11.25-5. Mined bentonite first is transported to the processing plant and stockpiled. If the raw clay has a relatively high moisture content (30 to 35 percent), the stockpiled material may be plowed to facilitate air drying to a moisture content of 16 to 18 percent.

## Mining and processing | Bentonite
Bentonite production process features ore mining, sodium activation - if required -, drying, and milling. Sodium activation is performed to convert calcium bentonite to sodium bentonite, in which calcium ions are exchanged for sodium carbonate. Through drying, bentonite natural moisture content of about 25-35% is reduced.

Drying Bentonite. Bentonite, as mined, typically contains between 25-35% moisture and requires drying to 5% to 12%. This is often accomplished through the use of a rotary drum dryer. While drying can be a fairly straightforward task in mineral processing, bentonite requires special attention, as overdrying risks diminished performance of the clay.
