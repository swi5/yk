## Coal and Petroleum: Meaning, Formation, and Conservation - Embibe Exams
The extraction of Coal is high, whereas the extraction of petroleum is low. Q.3. What is the importance of coal and petroleum? Ans: Coal and petroleum are the natural resources that are important sources of energy for us. Coal is used as a fuel in homes and industry or used to generate electricity at Thermal Power Plants. Petroleum products

## Formation, Occurrence, Extraction and Refining of coal and petroleum.
Petroleum does not occur in all the places of earth. It is found only in certain places of earth. Natural gas occurs just above the petroleum oil trapped under the rocks. 7. Extraction Extraction of coal Coal is extracted through deep shaft mining in which very deep holes are made to reach the ore lying at a great beneath the crust.

## Coal Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Coal production continues to grow globally due to the demand for low cost energy and iron and steel, as well as cement. Coal, based on the current extraction rates, will last about 115 years longer than conventional oil and gas reserves, with an estimated 1.1 trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. Ten countries are responsible for 90% of the total global coal production.

Abstract. Demonstration or commercial gravity drainage oil mining projects are currently operating in the US and the USSR, and extractive techniques are being used in Canada. A review of reservoirs in 60 free world countries indicates potential candidates for oil mining in most of the petroleum producing regions.

Coal Mining Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.

Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## Canada's mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction expands in March 
May 31, 2022Similarly, oil and gas extraction (except oil sands) rose 0.9% as growth in crude petroleum extraction more than offset lower natural gas extraction. StatCan also noted that support activities for mining, and oil and gas extraction increased 0.8% in March on account of an increase in drilling and rigging services.
