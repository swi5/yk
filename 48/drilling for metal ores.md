## Mineral Exploration Drilling Rigs | Wide Range | Epiroc US
There are two main methods of exploration drilling - core drilling and reverse circulation drilling (usually referred to as RC). Core drilling, yields a solid, cylinder shaped sample of the ground at an exact depth. Reverse circulation (RC) drilling, yields a crushed sample, comprising cuttings from a fairly well determined depth in the hole.Beyond that, the drill hole itself can provide a

Drilling in metal pipes. If you're drilling into a metal pipe, make sure the workpiece is firmly clamped. It's best to use a drill stand and a vise. You can prevent the pipe from distorting - as a result of the pressure from the drill - by inserting a piece of wood of the same size and shape into the pipe. Here again: let the drill do

Drilling through metals create a lot of friction. This friction generates heat. The heat generated in the process not only damages your drill bits, but can also damage the metal you are drilling into. To reduce the chances of damage due to friction and heat, it is a good idea to add a few drops of oil to the metal before you start drilling. You

## Ore Conservation is a Major Benefit When Scrap Metal Gets Recycled
The methods for extracting iron ore include drilling, blasting and excavating. Once iron ore is removed from the ground, the next production phase is beneficiation. That involves dissolving rock material to get the mineral. Iron in its purest form is then shipped to global markets. Mining and refining metal ores is simply not a sustainable process.

Mar 5, 2021A more specific type of drill is used for drilling thin sheet metal. When making a deep hole, the drill is first centered at the top, and at the exit is held by the ribbons of the spiral part. However, in thin metal, the apex goes right through before the ribbons hit the edges, making the hole ragged, misaligned, or oval.

Therefore, a successful drill campaign must be optimally designed for intersection of ore shoots and not the intervening zones. However, the typical drill-hole design for fault-fill veins, which targets the vein directly downdip from the highest-grade outcrops, will miss most ore shoots that rake less than ~80° to 90° in the structure.
