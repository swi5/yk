## Life cycle assessment of iron ore mining and processing
The extraction of iron ore involves surface (open-pit) or underground mining techniques (please refer to Chapter 7 (Stace, 2015) on Iron Ore Extraction Techniques). The LCA boundary used in this study is shown in Figure 20.4.The mining method selected depends on a variety of factors, including the nature and location of the deposit and the size, depth, and grade of the deposit.

Iron Ore Mining Process Explained. Necessary for the initial stages of the mining process, a miner's tools were generally constructed of iron with wooden handles and included a shovel, pike, hoe, pick, hammer and wedge. The ore reaped by these tools then needed to be hauled to the surface through a variety of means. Get Price.

## Process Of Iron Mining
The Mining Process. 1. Mining open pit and underground. To define the ore from the waste rock samples are taken and assayed. Assay results are used to mark out areas of ore and waste rock which are mined separately. Some of the harder areas require blasting to loosen the rock prior to excavation by hydraulic diggers.

## Global iron ore output to fall by 2% in 2022 amid decline in China, Russia
Overall, the global iron ore production is expected to grow at a forecast period () CAGR of 2.6% to reach 2,716.9Mt in 2026. Overall, this growth will be primarily driven by Australia and Brazil, with Australian miners, including BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue, expected to expand operational activities alongside Brazilian giant Vale's expansion plans post-2019 tailings dam disaster

## Iron Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The deep mining of iron ore is unusual in the modern era, but in northern Sweden, ore is mined from considerable depth largely aided by the application of automation and remote control equipment.  During the iron ore sintering process, calcium ferrite phase is believed to be the most desirable bonding phase because it has high reducibility
