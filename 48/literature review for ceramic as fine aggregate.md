## Utilization of Ceramic Waste as Fine Aggregate Within Portland Cement 
Abstract: The Present paper investigates the influence of water absorption of ceramic waste aggregate on strength properties of ceramic aggregate concrete. Compressive strength and split tensile strength of concrete made with ceramic waste aggregate is studied with replacement of natural coarse aggregate by ceramic waste aggregate at 0%, 20%

## Influence of Ceramic Waste as Fine Aggregate in Concrete: Pozzolanic 
The raw fine bone china aggregates were evaluated for pozzolanic activity using the Frattini test, saturated lime test, and strength activity index test. The compressive strength results showed that up to 60% of the fine bone china ceramic aggregate (FBCCA) can be used to produce concrete with desirable strength characteristics.

## The Influence of Ceramic Ball as a Fine Aggregate in Concrete
Sep 3, 2021Specific gravity for the ceramic ball is 2.75 and sand is 2.55 which is nearly similar, and hence, the ceramic ball can be used as a substitute for sand in concrete. The characteristic strength of the M30 concrete mix is 38.25 MPa. The strength in 30% replacement is 33.85 MPa. Hence, waste samples can be used to replace 30% sand in fine aggregate.

The test results showed that the replacement fine aggregate by crusher dust up to 50% by weight had a negligible effect on the reduction of any physical and mechanical properties while there was a saving of 56% of cost. The percentage of saving would be more and highly beneficial for mass production of paving blocks.

## Use of ceramic wastes as aggregates in concrete production: A review 
Nov 1, 2021As aggregate occupies the large volume fraction in concrete, about 80%-85% of a typical concrete mixture, it exerts a vital influence on the compressive strength of concrete and other properties as well [16,17]. Ceramic aggregate is resistant to abrasion and heat and has a low thermal expansion coefficient [18].

## (PDF) Ceramic waste in concrete-A Review
The results showed that partial replacement of fine aggregate with sanitary ceramic fillers up to 20% of cement by weight improves compressive and flexural strength and reduces shrinkage.

## Replacement of Cement and Fine Aggregate by Ceramic Powder and Copper 
More studies were carried out replacing cement but ceramic powder and replacing fine aggregate by copper slag separately. From the literature review we can to know maximum percentage of replacement of ingredients. In this study, different mix proportions were carried out by replacing different percentage of ceramic powder and copper slag.

## Literature Review of Glass-Ceramic and Willemite  - SpringerLink
Abstract. The first attempt to produce a glass ceramic from waste material was reported as early as the 1960s and involved use of several types of slag of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, ash, and waste from the mining and chemical industries. Willemite (Zn 2 SiO 4 ), which is a good host for rare earths to be used in telecommunications, has
