## Working principle of small glass crusher machine - Sunco Machinery
On the center shaft of the small glass crusher machine, there are many hammers.When the glass bottle crusher is working, the motor makes the center shaft rotate in high speed. As a result, the hammers also are rotating in high speed. The glass bottles are crushed into small pieces by the high speed rotating hammers.

## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing stations.
