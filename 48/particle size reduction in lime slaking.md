Platform Slaking of Lime. To obtain a powdered form of slaked lime, platform slaking is used. This is done using a water-tight impermeable platform made from masonry or concrete structure. In this process, quick lime is spread in a 150mm thick layer over the platform & water starts sprinkling over the quick lime in small quantities.

## Nanotechnology - Particle Size Reduction Equipment and Technology
Particle size reduction is the process in which large, solid particles are broken down into smaller particle sizes. This process is often achieved by the use of high shear forces. Particle size reduction is a key process used to transform bulky or randomly sized substances into uniform, small particles suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Utilization efficiency of lime consumption during magnesium sulfate 
It is well known that slaking conditions influence Ca(OH) 2 particle size. Higher slaking temperatures tend to reduce particle size (Zinck and Aube, 2000) whereas some slaking water impurities, such as sulfates, increase particle size (Potgieter et al., 2003). Slaking technologies, including mixing and milling, also influence slaked lime

## Lime Slaking Equipment - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The limestone must be crushed and screened to a size suitable for feeding a kiln. Kiln feed limestone for a rotary kiln is normally sized approximately 2â³ x 1/2â³. The ratio of kiln feed limestone to lime produced is approximately 2 to 1. In other words, approximately two tons of limestone must be put into a kiln in order to produce one ton of lime.

## Process engineering: Particle size reduction techniques and equipment
Impact-based equipment commonly uses hammers or media. The pros and cons of several types of size-reduction equipment are shown in the table. Rolls, in particular, can produce very fine particles. Rolls are used in flour milling, where crushing yields different-sized particles, allowing separation of purified flours.

## Particle size reduction and size separation | Basicmedical Key
Introduction to size reduction. The significance of particle size in drug delivery has been discussed in Chapter 9 and some of the reasons for carrying out a size reduction operation have already been noted. In addition, the function of size reduction (also called comminution) may be to aid efficient processing of solid particles by facilitating powder mixing or the production of suspensions.
