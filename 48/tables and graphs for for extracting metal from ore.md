## les and graphs for for extracting metal from ore
A solid element or compound which occurs naturally in the Earth's crust is called a mineral.A mineral which contains a high enough percentage of a metal for economic extraction is called a metal ore. Economic extraction means that the cost of getting the metal out of the ore is sufficiently less than the amount of money made by selling the metal.

The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.

Hydrometallurgy. Metallurgy consists of three general steps: (1) mining the ore, (2) separating and concentrating the metal or the metal-containing compound, and (3) reducing the ore to the metal. Additional processes are sometimes required to improve the mechanical properties of the metal or increase its purity.

EXTRACTION OF METALS:-. Some metals are found in the earth's crust in the free state. Some are found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of the activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free state. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the free state.

How To Extract Metal From Ore? Metal is extracted from the crushed ore by one of two major methods: smelting or electrolysis. Smelting uses heat to separate the valuable metal from the rest of the ore. Smelting usually requires a reduction agent or another chemical to separate metal from its ore. May 7 2011

Methods of extraction Many metals are found in the Earth's crust as ores. An ore is usually a compound of the metal mixed with impurities. When the metal is dug up, a method must be used to separate the metal from the rest of the ore. This is called extracting the metal. The method of extraction depends on how reactive the metal is.

Metals with low chemical activity, such a gold and silver are normally found in their pure state. Copper, tin, lead, and iron are more reactive and must be heated with carbon to extract the metals. Aluminum, calcium, sodium and other active metals are extracted using electrolysis. Copper can be extracted from its ores by reduction.
