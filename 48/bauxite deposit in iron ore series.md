## Bauxite Reserves and Production Worldwide - Geo Guide
Bauxite is a naturally occurring, heterogeneous material composed primarily of one or more aluminum hydroxide minerals, plus various mixtures of silica, iron oxide, titania, aluminosilicate, and other impurities in minor or trace amounts. Bauxite deposits are formed by the decomposition of a wide variety of rocks rich in aluminium silicates.
