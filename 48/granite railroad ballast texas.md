## Comparison of coal dust fouled railroad ballast behavior - Granite vs 
The strength properties of both granite and limestone ballast samples were determined when coal dust was added to clean ballast samples at various percentages by weight of ballast under both dry and wet conditions. When the coal dust fouling percentage increased, the ballast shear strength generally decreased.
