## copper oxide and silica flux to remove iron from gold ore
 · To remove FeO (basic), the roasted ore is mixed with silica and heated. Silica acts as a flux and combines with ferrous oxide present to form fusible slag of iron silicate. The slag being lighter floats and forms the upper layer and is removed through slag hole. Therefore, silica helps to remove FeO in the metallurgy of copper.

This method improves the natural oxidation properties of aluminum that leaves a non-reactive layer of aluminum oxide to make the aluminum stronger and less reactive. Hard anodization also improves the resistance of the aluminum metal when exposed to extreme heat. The treated hard anodized aluminum holds up better and is less likely to warp.

## Flux (metallurgy)
In metallurgy, a flux (derived from Latin fluxus meaning "flow") is a chemical cleaning agent, flowing agent, or purifying agent. Fluxes may have more than one function at a time. They are used in both extractive metallurgy and metal joining. Some of the earliest known fluxes were sodium carbonate, potash, charcoal, coke, borax, lime, lead sulfide and certain minerals containing phosphorus.

The role of silica in the metallurgy of copper is to remove the iron oxide obtained during the process of extraction of pure copper from copper pyrite,  Why is silica added to copper ore?  The mineral pyrite (), or iron pyrite, also known as fool's gold, is an iron sulfide with the chemical formula FeS2 (iron (II) disulfide). Pyrite is
