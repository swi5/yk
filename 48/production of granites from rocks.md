## How Granite is Formed | Actforlibraries
The formation of granite means that granite can be found in a range of colours, from pink through to grey and black. The colour itself is dependent upon the mineralogy of the granite, and in particular the chemistry composition of the feldspar. Feldspar is natural light in colour, and a higher concentration of it will result in pink granite.

## Granite | Properties, Formation, Composition, Uses - Geology Science
That means that granite must form by the melting of continental rocks. That happens for two reasons: adding heat and adding volatiles (water or carbon dioxide or both). Continents are relatively hot because they contain most of the planet's uranium and potassium, which heat up their surroundings through radioactive decay.

## Magma Mixing and the Production of Compositional Variation  - DeepDyve
Likewise, assimilation of country rocks had no significant role in producing variation in the granites of southeastern Australia. The production of variation by differential separation of melt from residual solid source material, or restite, must be favoured for many of the granite suites of this region.

## Cumulate and Cumulative Granites and Associated Rocks
Cumulate rocks result, comprising a framework of cumulus minerals with interstitial melt. In this process some of the melt is also displaced to form more felsic rocks. Such cumulate rocks may have distinctive chemical compositions, but that is often not the case.  The production of cumulative granites typically occurs at more felsic melt
