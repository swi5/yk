Hematite, the most desirable iron ore because of its high iron content, is found throughout the world, with its highest abundance being seen in Australia, Brazil, and parts of Asia. Since the 1960's, high-grade hematite ore has served as the major source of iron mined in Australia. It comprises 96% of the iron ore exports from that continent.

Aug 31, 2022Hematite ore has been the main type of iron ore mined in Australia since the early 1960s. Almost all of Australia's iron ore exports are high-grade hematite ore, and most of its reserves are in The Hammersley Range in Western Australia because the range sits on a banded iron formation.

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be got.. Ores with high quantities of hematite or magnetite (more than about 60% iron) are known as "natural ore" or "direct shipping ore". They can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.. Iron is one of the most abundant rock-forming elements.It makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust.
