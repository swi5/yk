## coal mining - Choosing a mining method | Britannica
The various methods of mining a coal seam can be classified under two headings, surface mining and underground mining. Surface and underground coal mining are broad activities that incorporate numerous variations in equipment and methods, and the choice of which method to use in extracting a coal seam depends on many technological, economic, and social factors. The technological factors

Longwall Miner. Twenty percent to 30 percent of mined coal underground is from longwall mining. This is performed by a mechanical cutter that shears coal off from a panel on the seam. The panel being worked on may be up to 800 feet in width and 7,000 feet in length. Mined coal is deposited onto a conveyor that moves the coal to a collection area.

## What Technology Is Involved In Gathering Or Using Coal
If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground it can be extracted through surface mining. In surface mining workers simply remove any overlying sediment vegetation and rock called overburden. How do we collect energy from coal? Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced under

Coal mines operated without electricity. Electricity began to be adopted in mining and manufacturing in the late 1880s and the 1890s. (Electricity was first introduced into Ohio's bituminous coal mines in 1889.) The introduction of electricity in coal mines greatly facilitated the introduction of laborsaving machinery. 1891.
