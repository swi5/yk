## Coal Mining Effects on the Environment
Coal mining releases toxic materials into the soil and water. Bad mining can start coal fires which can burn for decades - releasing "fly ash" and smoke filled with greenhouse gases and toxic chemicals. It releases coal mine methane which is 20 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

## Top Reasons Why Coal Is Bad (Problems With Using Coal For Energy)
Coal mining can cause a number of environmental issues in the immediate area of mining - land degradation, damage to wildlife and their habitats, and water pollution. It can also displace local communities. In some parts of the world, coal mining also has harmful working conditions and can lead to human health problems (such as 'black lung').

## Why is coal so bad for the environment? - Short-Facts
Oct 8, 2020Burning coal emits large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Coal is composed almost entirely of carbon, so burning coal unleashes large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. These emissions have been shown to increase the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere and lead to global warming.

## What Is the Environmental Impact of Mining and Burning Coal?
Subsurface coal mining is dangerous. Coal is often mined in subsurface mines, which may collapse and trap miners. And the air in subsurface coal mines leads to black lung disease, where coal particles and pollutants fill the lungs and cause inflammation and respiratory illness. Surface coal mining damages the environment.

There is just no global consensus on this issue. You might make an argument that mining thermal coal is bad, but there is just no consensus that says that diamond mining is bad, for instance. The Paris Agreement carries specific implications for coal, namely a quick phase-out of thermal coal to stay in line with a 1.5C temperature limit.

The effects of mining coal on the environment. There are 2 ways to mine coal - Strip Mining and Underground Mining - both ways have their own impact to the environment and health. We know it but coal is such a cheap energy source that we don't want to let go of it. The negative effects of coal mining cannot be disputed:

## Strip Mining: A Destructive Way of Coal Extraction
Surface or strip mining damages and pollutes ecosystems to a great degree. This is because by definition the process of strip mining involves striping away trees, plants and topsoil so that the coal can be accessed underneath. This means that surface mining destroys mountain tops, landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats.

## ELI5: Why is Mining bad for the environment. : explainlikeimfive
Mostly pollution, in particular coal mining since the coal will become pollution as well. When mining for metals there is a lot of energy consumed, not just fuel by the mining machines but also to extract the metals and purify them (a lot of heating to melt them). 1. level 2. itsnotmasonyep.
