## Silver mining
Ore processing. Once removed from the mine, silver-containing ore is crushed (commutation) into a fine powder to expose individual grains to chemical processing.As a byproduct of mining of lead and copper, silver ores are often purified by froth flotation.After froth flotation, silver is extracted by a cyanide process, akin to technology used for gold extraction.

## What are the major uses of silver?
Silver-bearing ores are mined by open-pit or underground methods and then are crushed and ground. Since virtually all the ores are sulfides, they are amenable to flotation separation, by which a 30- to 40-fold concentration of mineral values is usually achieved.  Platinum is widely used as a catalyst for chemical reactions. The most

Argentite, which is a sulphide ore, is the chief source of silver. It is extracted by the process of leaching with a dilute solution of sodium cyanide. Silver dissolves and forms a complex, argentocyanide. It is further treated with scrap zinc, which displaces silver from the complex. This is called displacement method or hydrometallurgy.
