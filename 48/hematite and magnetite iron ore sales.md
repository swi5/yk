## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Hematite and magnetite are by far the most common types of ore. Pure magnetite contains 72.4 percent iron, hematite 69.9 percent, limonite 59.8 percent, and siderite. Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## Is it hematite or haematite? Explained by FAQ Blog
Which is better magnetite or hematite? While magnetite ore requires more treatment, end products made from magnetite ore are typically of higher quality than those made from hematite ore. That's because magnetite ore has fewer impurities than hematite ore; in this way, the elevated cost of processing magnetite ore can be balanced out.

hematite ore generally contains large concentrations of hematite, magnetite ore generally holds low concentrations of magnetite. As a result, this type of iron ore ore must be concentrated before it can be used to produce steel.

Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.. Dnipro ( Ukrainian

One of the major advantages hematite ore has over other types like magnetite ore is its high iron content. That makes the iron extraction process much less costly and time consuming. In addition, hematite ore only goes through one stage of screening and crushing, while magnetite ore has an additional round of processing.

## Iron ore | BHP
What is iron ore? Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red.

## Is Hematite Magnetic? - Techiescientist
Yes, hematite being an iron ore is magnetic in nature. It is antiferromagnetic in nature below the Morin transition ie; approximately at 250 K. And it acts as a weak ferromagnet above the Morin transition and Neel temperature, which is approximately 948 K. In addition to this, hematite above the Neel temperature is a pure paramagnet.
