## Canary in the Coal Mine by Madelyn Rosenberg
Even today, coal mining isn't a job for the faint of heart, and it was a good deal more nerve-wracking during the first half of the twentieth century. Yearly mine fatalities in the USA peaked in 1907 at a mind-boggling 3,242, and it wasn't until 1946 that that number first dipped below 1,000.

## coal mining - Coal deposits | Britannica
In geologic terms, coal is a sedimentary rock containing a mixture of constituents, mostly of vegetal origin. Vegetal matter is composed mainly of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and some inorganic mineral elements. When this material decays under water, in the absence of oxygen, the carbon content increases. The initial product of this decomposition process is known as peat.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit
