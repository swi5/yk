Open-pit coal mining is a combination of contour and area mining methods and is used to mine thick, steeply inclined coalbeds. In contrast to other forms of mining, open pit mines increased in number from 2008 to 2017, but production levels still fell.  Mountaintop mines are relatively few in number compared with contour strip, open pit, and

Open-pit mining clearly offers a number of economic advantages over underground mining, especially now that mineral-processing technology has advanced to the stage where very low-grade ores can be treated profitably. 100 to 150 years ago, this was not the case, and mining was still much more selective.

8.2.3.1 Open pit mining Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production.

## Montana and coal - Global Energy Monitor
Introduction. Montana coal mines produced 41.8 million tons of coal in 2006 (3.6% of the U.S. total), making Montana the 6th-biggest coal-producing state in the country. About a quarter of Montana's coal production (10 million tons) is consumed at the four units of the Colstrip Steam Plant in Colstrip, Montana which is the second largest coal-fired power plant west of the Mississippi River.

## Modern Open Pits - International Mining
The location of the coal seams and the adverse geotechnical condition of the open-pit slopes meant that in areas adjacent to unstable sections of the pit the cost of additional overburden removal and the risks of coal extraction outweighed the benefits to production. With declining global coal prices, PT Bayan developed a strategy to address
