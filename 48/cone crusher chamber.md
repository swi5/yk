## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel. Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point. As the wedge or eccentric rotates to cause the compression within the chamber, the

## Our Range of Trio® Cone Crushers | Weir
Trio® cone crushers work by applying a steady compression force, squeezing the product between the mantle and the crushing chamber wall. Compared to the power and speed of impact crushing, compression crushing is a more controlled method of size reduction, making it favourable for harder, more abrasive rocks.

The two main crushing parts of cone crusher are the mantle and the concave. The axis of the mantle intersects the axis of the crushing chamber at point O, which is a pivot point.The angle between the two axes is γ, which is an eccentric angle, as shown in Fig. 1.As the crusher is working, the mantle moves around the axis of the crushing chamber.
