## The Different Types of Rock Crushers - Interesting Facts
Rocks and minerals unearthed from quarries go through a crushing process to become useful in construction—rocks become aggregate, which is the base to concrete. The aggregate process uses multiple rock crushers. They are used at different points within the three stages of the milling process: primary, secondary, and tertiary.

The demand for large-mouthed jaw crushers skyrocketed as the industry began to understand their potential as primary crushers in rock quarries. Through Thomas A. Edison's research and development, giant machines were innovated and placed around the United States. Smaller-sized jaw crushers were also developed as secondary and tertiary crushers.

A cone crusher can crush a variety of rocks, from medium to hard. The way a cone crusher operates is similar to how a gyratory crusher does, but in a cone crusher the slope in the breaking space is not as steep. Although it is known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, the cone crusher is better suited for secondary crushing.

## What Is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Crushing? - Eagle Crusher
The degree to which material is reduced through stages of primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing can depend on the type of material, like aggregate, concrete, and asphalt, and can also depend on the variety of output sizes needing produced. Primary crushing is the first stage of material reduction and can sometimes be the only stage needed

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

##  Tertiary Rocks
TERTIARY ROCKS As seen on the geologic map, most of the Tertiary rocks lie along the crest of the Sierra Nevada north of Lake Tahoe. These are mainly soft volcanic and sedimentary rocks, and are a small remnant of the Tertiary rocks that once covered most of the northern Sierra Nevada. Let's take a look at how these Tertiary rocks were formed.

GUARANTEED FOR REAL LIFE. Typically applied in secondary and tertiary stages, the cone crusher produces reduction ratios of 6:1 to 4:1. Bushing cones, like Superior's Patriot Cone Crusher, consist of a rotating mantle inside a steel bowl. As rock is compressed between the mantle and the bowl, the force generated fractures the material.
