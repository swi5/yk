## Controlling 4 electromagnets with Arduino
Use one MOSFET per coil if only attraction from the magnetic coil is wanted. To have magnetic repulsion and attraction would use four. These values described are for a miniature apparatus, larger ball bearings and bigger sizes will scale up the power and current needed. For 20 gram balls moving 10 cm use 4 amps and re-calculate as above.

## Making an electromagnet — Science Learning Hub
Electromagnets can be created by wrapping a wire around an iron nail and running current through the wire. The electric field in the wire coil creates a magnetic field around the nail. In some cases, the nail will remain magnetised even when removed from within the wire coil. Electromagnets are fundamental to many modern technologies.

## Safe & Effective Use of Electromagnetic Equipment | IMT Canada
In the process of magnetic separation, electromagnets or permanent magnets are used to extract sources of potential contamination before it can damage machinery. In this capacity, electromagnets can help provide a boost to manufacturing efficiency. There are some things you should consider when choosing between the use of an electromagnet or a

Medium balls: 80mm. Large steel balls: 100mm or 120mm. Super large balls: 130mm to 150mm. Theoretically, when the filling amount of steel grinding balls in the cylinder of the ball mill is 40%, the ball mill can obtain an ideal output. However, in actual production, the filling rate of steel grinding balls in the cylinder of the ball mill is
