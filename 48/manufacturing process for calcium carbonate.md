## Calcium carbonate - Essential Chemical Industry
The process is known as 'slaking'. Solid calcium hydroxide is known as slaked lime or hydrated lime, and solutions and suspensions in water as milk of lime.  Data for the annual production of calcium carbonate are not readily available. Approximately 1 billion tonnes of its two principal ores, limestone and dolomite, are mined annually in
