## Iron Ore Pellet Production - FEECO International Inc.
About Iron Ore Pelletizing (Balling) Pellets are a high-grade source of iron ore and are produced via a type of agitation agglomeration (wet granulation or tumble-growth agglomeration) known as pelletizing, and referred to in the iron ore sector as "balling.". The balling process is carried out utilizing either a rotary drum or disc

All the above problems on account of ore quality can be overcome with the use of iron ore pellets. The pellets being well sized, high in iron content, having high cold and reduction strength are the ideal input for sponge iron production. The ore fines used for pellet production should be beneficiated to get economic advantage in steel making.

## Sintering: A Step Between Mining Iron Ore and Steelmaking
The United States was estimated to have produced 2.0% and consumed 1.6% of the world's iron ore output Globally, iron ore production in 2018 was expected to increase slightly from that of 2017, primarily owing to increased production in Australia and the completion of a mine in Brazil.

## Iron Ore,Production Process of Iron Ore,Iron Ore Beneficiation flow 
Ore, which contains an economical use of iron, is called an iron ore. There are many types of iron ore, magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3) and (FeCO3), etc, which are mainly used for iron making. Iron ore is an important raw material for iron and steel production enterprises. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, gravity concentration
