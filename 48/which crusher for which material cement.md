## Cement Crushers and Lump Breakers | Franklin Miler
The cement manufacturing process begins with raw materials such as limestone and clay. These materials must be mined and then ground with a crusher to a fine powder, which is often referred to as raw meal. The ground material is heated in a cement kiln to temperatures as high as 1450 degrees Celsius.
