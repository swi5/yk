Kaolinite is a typical mineral in soil. From TEM imaging, the observed kaolinite particles are at the nanoscale, in the form of a laminar structure of pseudo-hexagonal platelets (Suzuki et al., 2013) (Fig. 10 A).The EDS-mapping analysis shows that the ratio of the atomic concentration of Al/Si is close to 1.0, which is consistent with the theoretical chemical composition of kaolinite (Al 2 Si

## Estimating kaolinite crystallinity using near-infrared spectroscopy 
Introduction. Kaolinite is a 1:1 dioctahedral triclinic phyllosilicate [Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4] (e.g., Bish 1993 and references therein). Kaolinite is the most common polymorph of kaolin-group minerals. It has two monoclinic polymorphs: dickite and nacrite that mainly form in diagenetic and hydrothermal contexts (Swindale 1975; Buatier et al. 1996; Beaufort et al. 1998).

## Kaolin | Imerys
Kaolin is a rock from which the clay mineral kaolinite is derived. This one has been used for millennia as the principal ingredient in porcelain tableware. Today Imerys kaolins bring critical properties to a host of end applications ranging from paper to paints, fiberglass to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
