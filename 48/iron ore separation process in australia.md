## Iron Ore | Geoscience Australia
In 2018, Australia's EDR of iron ore increased by 3% from 2017 to 49 604 Mt (Table 3). Similarly, there was a 4% EDR increase of contained iron to 24 122 Mt (Table 4). EDR attributable to magnetite deposits have decreased by 1%, likely due to re-assessment of projects and inactivity in the magnetite industry.

Besides, the separation machines are devide into the dry and wet magnetic separation. Generally, iron ore with an iron content of 35% can increase iron content by 20% after magnetic separation. Such a combined process method, the ore utilization rate can reach 90%. In the process of magnetic separation, it saves water, reduces cost and pollution.

The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.
