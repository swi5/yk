## Quartzite - Formation, Composition, Properties, and Uses
Quartzite (from German Quarzit) forms when quartz sandstones are metamorphosed. The term quartzite also implies its high quartz content. Most quartzites contain 90% quartz by volume, but the percentage can go up to 99% in the case of the purest quartzite forms. Quartzite looks similar to its parent rock but it is much harder than sandstone.

## Quartzite Rock Formation, Uses, Properties and Occurrence - Geology Science
Quartzite is a metamorphic rock made from quartz sandstone, a sedimentary rock predominantly composed of the silicate mineral quartz. The chemical composite of the quartz minerals is silicon dioxide, written SiO2. The metamorphic forces of heat and pressure force the quartz minerals to bind together and crystallize into a strong matrix.

Quartzite is a metamorphic rock and formed from pure quartz sandstone through heating and pressure. Pure quartzite stone occurs in grey to white tones, but due to varying amounts of iron oxides (Fe 2 O 3), it is also found in different shades of pink and red.Apart from Fe 2 O 3, other mineral impurities can impart other colors to quartzite, such as green, blue, orange and yellow.
