Mill's methods of inductive reasoning are, in part, an extension of Bacon's scientific work. These methods form the backbone of inductive science. His methods are essentially simple to understand, but, discovering how these patterns emerge in historical case studies of experimental inquiry can, at times, be quite challenging.
