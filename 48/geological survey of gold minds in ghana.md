## Analysis of mine water from four decommissioned pits in south-western 
This form of gold mining is the most widely practised in Ghana, both by the large-scale miners and small-scale artisanal miners. In most instances, mining companies stop mining midstream of the mining life and such pits are left without any proper reclamation. Examples are the Konongo Mines and the Bonte Mines all along the Ashanti Belt in Ghana.

## Geology of Ghana
Sedimentary gold is found in the Banket conglomerate near the base of the Tarkwaian. This includes the Iduapriem Gold Mine, Teberebie Mine, and those located at Tarkwa, and Abosso, located along the eastern margin of the Tarkwa syncline. Accompanying minerals include rutile, zircon, and detrital hematite, all within gravel horizons.

## Ground Collapse: Old mines and prospects and sinkholes - NC
Building above an abandoned mine can be dangerous if the mine is weak or near the ground surface. On Feb. 18, 2000, a collapse hole developed in the front yard of a house in Cabarrus County (Figure 21). The hole was above the old Phoenix Gold Mine, which closed in 1906. In the 1980s a suburban golf course community was built over the mine.
