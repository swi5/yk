## Countries That Mine Bauxite
· Bauxite tailings are produced during the Bayer Process which is the most commonly used method of refining bauxite to aluminum oxide. Estimates indicated that roughly 95% of the aluminum oxide produced in the world was made through the Bayer Process. After the bauxite ore is extracted from mines, it is taken to a plant where it is refined.

## Bauxite Beneficiation: Efficient Way to Remove Silica in Bauxite
The main component of bauxite is Al 2 O 3, containing a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, and other impurities. The main objective of bauxite beneficiation is to lower the concentration of reactive silica, and also to increase the alumina content. In addition, bauxite beneficiation can also be used for iron extraction or iron removal.
