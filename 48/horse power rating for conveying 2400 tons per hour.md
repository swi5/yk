## Converting Tons Per Hour to KWH - Electric motors & generators 
Convert 435hp to kw --> 435kW  .746 = 324.51kW. Since feed rate on belts is 800tph I know that it takes 1hr to move 800 tons. During this hour we can calculate a kWH rate of 324.5  1h = 324.5kWH. 800 tons across belts = 324.5kWH. 1 ton across belts = 324.5kwH / 800tons = .40kWH per ton. So the answer I will give managment is .40kWh per ton.
