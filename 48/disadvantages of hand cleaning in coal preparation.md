## Coal Cleaning - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The primary disadvantage of a heavy media process is the ancillary equipment that must be installed to support the operation of the separator ( Fig. 11 ). A typical circuit requires that the clean coal and refuse products pass over drain-and-rinse screens to wash the media from the surfaces of the products and to dewater the particles.

Here Are the Advantages of Coal. 1. It is available in an abundant supply. Industrialized countries, including the United States, India, China, and Russia, have a large amount of coal that is available to them. Some estimates have the US holding enough coal that has already been mined to fuel current resources for the next 400 years.

## What Are The Advantages and Disadvantages of Coal Energy
Radiation. One of the major disadvantages of burning coal is that it produces radiation in the form of coal ash. This ash will settle in the surrounding areas of the coal plant. Some tests have shown that a coal plant has the ability to produce 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant does. Coal can also produce things like nitrous

## What is Clean-Coal Technology?
Impurities Trapped Inside Coal Traces of impurities such as sulfur and nitrogen are trapped inside coal. These impurities are released into the atmosphere when the coal is burned. Combined with water vapor, these impurities form droplets that fall back to Earth as a weak form of sulfuric and nitric acids, commonly known as acid rain.
