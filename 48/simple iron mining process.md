## How does mine drainage occur? | U.S. Geological Survey
Mine drainage is formed when pyrite (an iron sulfide) is exposed and reacts with air and water to form sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can precipitate to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage. The acid runoff further dissolves heavy metals such as copper, lead, and

Therefore, the mining of iron ore has been controlled by several large companies. Iron ore is the main component of steel and accounts for 95% of the world's metal use each year. The world's largest single iron ore producer is the Brazilian mining company called Vale, which produces more than 350 million tons of iron ore per year.

## Data Mining Process: Models, Process Steps & Challenges Involved
Data Mining is an iterative process where the mining process can be refined, and new data can be integrated to get more efficient results. Data Mining meets the requirement of effective, scalable and flexible data analysis. It can be considered as a natural evaluation of information technology.
