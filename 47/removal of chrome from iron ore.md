##  Sulfur removal from iron ore concentrate by leaching - SID
Up to now Much research has been done to remove sulfur from iron ore.Sulfur removal can be performed by two main methods: conventional hydrometallurgical method (smelting/converting) and hydrometallurgical method (leaching or bioleaching) . The sulfur content reduction in iron ores is conventionally carried out by Floatation after grinding.

## Difference Between Iron Ore and Iron
Iron is extracted from its ore through removal of oxygen, which is a process called its reduction. Another process is through blast furnace where the ore is heated with carbon (coke). Iron thus produced using coke in blast furnaces is called pig iron, while iron produced through direct reduction is called sponge iron.
