## Ball mill
A ball mill, a type of grinder, is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores, chemicals, ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including ceramic balls, flint pebbles, and stainless steel balls.

## Ball Mill: Operating principles, components, Uses, Advantages and
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

Posted 06 September 2011 - 01:54 PM. If you watch EBAY, you can often buy a brand new 1/2 or 3/4 HP single phase TEFC motor (around 1750 RPM) with a floor mount from $50 to $150 bucks + shipping. Well worth the money for a ball mill. The difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits.
