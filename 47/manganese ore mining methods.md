The principal method of mining soft ore was, in the middle eighties, almost entirely by the square-set system of rooms and pillars. The rooms were usually three sets, or 21 ft., wide and as long as the orebody.

## manganese processing | Britannica
manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Manganese (Mn) is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 °C (2,271 °F). Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such as sulfur and oxygen and adds important physical properties to the metal.
