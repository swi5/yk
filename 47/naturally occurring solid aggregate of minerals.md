## naturally occurring solid aggregate of minerals
Mineral and ore deposits. A "mineral" is a naturally occurring, homogeneous solid element or compound, of definite chemical composition, having an ordered atomic structure and, thus, in a crystalline condition. "Rocks," the solid materials of the earth, are aggregates of one or more minerals. "Ore" is a naturally occurring aggregate

## naturally occuring solid aggregate of minerals
Jul 06, 2020 · A rock is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter. It is categorized by the minerals included, its chemical composition and the way in which it is formed. Igneous rocks are formed when magma cools in the Earth's crust, or lava cools on the ground surface or the seabed.

## Minerals: A Solid, Naturally Occurring Inorganic Substance (Part 1)
A mineral is an inorganic solid which is naturally occured. It has a fixed chemical composition and an ordered atomic arrangement. This may seem a bit of a mouthful but if you break it down it becomes simpler. The geological definition of the mineral normally excludes compounds that appear only in living things.

## Rock (geology)
In geology, rock (or stone) is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter. It is categorized by the minerals included, its chemical composition, and the way in which it is formed.Rocks form the Earth's outer solid layer, the crust, and most of its interior, except for the liquid outer core and pockets of magma in the asthenosphere.
