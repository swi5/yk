Mistracking. As mentioned above, slipping can be the cause of a loose belt. However, there is another cause of slipping: mistracking. This happens if the belt is not positioned on the rollers correctly. Mistracking can also lead to improper belt wear and possible breakage. So make sure the belt is correctly set up and aligned.

Conveyors can fail for a variety of reasons. Materials such as grain or rocks may be damp or wet - significantly adding to the weight on the conveyor belt and ultimately leading to belt slippage and slowdown. Conveyor belts can break due to overload, wear and tear, or the motor driving the conveyor may fail.

What causes tracking problems? Conveyor belt tracking problems are often blamed on the belts themselves. This is not always the case. Usually the problems can be blamed on poor installation, such as pulleys and rollers not being properly adjusted, or using the wrong belt tracking measures. Sometimes however it's simply just faulty conveyor design.
