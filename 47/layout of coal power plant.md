Definition: The power plant that is used to warm the water to generate steam, then this steam can be used for rotating huge turbines for generating electricity. These plants use the heat to warm the water which is generated by nuclear fission. So the atoms in the nuclear fission will split into different smaller atoms for generating energy.
