## Recycling | Free Full-Text | Biohydrometallurgical Recovery of Metals 
Electronic waste (e-waste) is an emerging health and environmental burden due to the toxic substances present within e-wastes. To address this burden, e-wastes contain various base, rare earth and noble metals, which can be recovered from these substances, thus serving as secondary sources of metals. Pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes have been developed to extract metals from

## Potential dangers of mining rare earth metals - Dr Prem's Life 
The dangers of mining rare earth metals to human health. Rare earth metals cause harm to humans by getting inside the body through the mouth, skin and respiratory tract and via injections. It is removed from the body through the body via bile discharge and urine. Those metals which remain in the body have harmful effects.

For every ton of rare earth produced, the mining process yields 13kg of dust, 9,600-12,000 cubic meters of waste gas, 75 cubic meters of wastewater, and one ton of radioactive residue. This stems from the fact that rare earth element ores have metals that, when mixed with leaching pond chemicals, contaminate air, water, and soil.

## Asteroid Mining Could Solve Rare Metal Shortage
Jan 31, 2020. This may sound like science fiction, but since at least the 1970s, organisations like NASA have been considering the possible advantages of asteroid mining for resources.

## Rare Metals Background - Massachusetts Institute of Technology
The critical rare metals (RMs) and metalloids discussed in this section are niobium, tantalum, cobalt, indium, zirconium, gallium, and lithium. Most of these elements are mined in substantial quantities that meet world demand. However, the few countries that possess economically viable sources of critical elements are also experiencing booms in
