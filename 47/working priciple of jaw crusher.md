## Jaw Crusher: Range, Working Principle, Application - DSMAC
Jaw Crusher Working Principle. A jaw or toggle crusher consists of a set of vertical jaws, one jaw being fixed and the other being moved back and forth relative to it by a cam or pitman mechanism. The jaws are farther apart at the top than at the bottom, forming a tapered chute so that the material is crushed progressively smaller and smaller

## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing stations.

## Jaw Crusher Working Principle - StudiousGuy
A jaw crusher mainly works on the principle of reciprocating motion exhibited by the moveable jaw of the jaw crusher. The repeated movement of the jaws results in the development of compression force that further causes the breakdown of the rock or the ore placed between the two jaws into smaller pieces. The movement of the jaw crusher is
