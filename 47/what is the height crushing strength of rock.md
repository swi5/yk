## Rock Strength - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The tensile strength of rock is defined as the pulling force, required to rupture a rock sample, divided by the sample's cross-sectional area. The tensile strength of rock is very small and is of the order of 0.1 times the compressive strength. Thus, a rock material is more likely to fail in tension than in compression.

## crushing strength of rock
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

The high-porosity (33%) sandstone ( Fig. 4a) has a low "crush" strength of about 55 MPa. With a lower porosity of 19%, Berea sandstone has a much higher strength of 440 MPa ( Fig. 4b ). Notice that in both Figs. 4a and 4b, permanent deformation remains even after the stress is released.
