## Froth Flotation Process - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Jan 20, 2021The froth flotation process was patented by E. L.Sulman, H. F. K. Pickard, and John Ballot in 1906, 19 years after the first cyanide process patents of MacArthur and the Forests. It was the result of the intelligent recognition of a remarkable phenomenon which occurred while they were experimenting with the Cattermole process. This was the

## Froth Flotation Principle and Process - Important Topic for JEE - VEDANTU
Froth Flotation Process Principle. The froth flotation process is all about exploiting the natural hydrophobicity of liberated metals and playing with making them individually hydrophobic in order to accurately separate them from one another. The particles of metal sulphide are hydrophobic. Due to this property, they are primarily wetted by oil

## Froth flotation
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic. This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.

The floatation process operates by preparing a water suspension of a mixture of relatively finely sized solids. This is usually done in an agitated chamber open at the top. Fine bubbles of air are then dispersed through the agitated suspension to form a froth that rises to the top of the chamber.

Froth floatation process is used for the concentration of sulphide ores mainly. The particles based on differences in the ability of air bubbles that selectively attach to specific mineral surfaces in mineral water slurry are separated by this method. In this method, crushed ore is suspended in water and air is passed through suspension.

Mining - Flotation. One of the most widely used methods of recovering valuable minerals in the mining industry is using froth flotation tanks. Inside these tanks, the ground ore is mixed with water to form a slurry. Hydrophobic materials then separate from hydrophilic materials through the use of chemical additives.

## Who discovered froth flotation?pro
What is the principle of froth flotation? For example, froth flotation is a technique commonly used in the mining industry. In this technique, particles of interest are physically separated from a liquid phase as a result of differences in the ability of air bubbles to selectively adhere to the surface of the particles, based upon their hydrophobicity.
