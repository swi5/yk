## The Working Principle Of A Jaw Crusher - Editors Top
There are two main types of jaw crushers: double toggle and overhead eccentric jaw crusher. The only difference between these two crushers is the location of the pivot joint. In the overhead eccentric jaw crushers, the pivot joint is located at the bottom of the chamber, while at the double toggle crushers, the pivot joint is on the top.
