The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber - it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action.

In the overhead eccentric jaw crushers, the pivot joint is located at the bottom of the chamber, while at the double toggle crushers, the pivot joint is on the top.
