For the 1-in. screen below the roll crusher the capacity has no correction factor and the area needed is 32/2.1 = 15.2 sq ft. To handle the output from a 40 x 24 roll crusher the screen will have to be at least 24 in. wide. Perhaps it will be more effective to use one continuous screen of at least 20.1 + 15.2 = 35.3 sq ft.

## How to Improve Operational Efficiency • Asana
Operational efficiency is the process of generating the same output with fewer resources. Operational productivity is the process of generating more output with the same amount of resources. Let's look at an example of each of these with one team: A manufacturing team of 20 people regularly creates 100 garments in one hour.

Yes, some may be more profitable. Others might offer slightly different services or products. But, by and large, it's hard to tell them apart. This is called strategic convergence and it happens when you focus too much on operational effectiveness at the expense of strategy. You see one of your competitors doing something, so you copy it.
