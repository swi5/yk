## [Tribune] The mining and metallurgical industry, a wealth of solutions!
Long denigrated, the French mining and metallurgical industry has already changed a lot and stands ready to take leading action. We are recyclers "by design": Brass made in France is produced from 100% recycled copper. 100% of lead is now recycled. 4 to 5 Mt of steel and alloys are produced with scrap. To recycle critical metals for electric batteries, permanent magnets, electronic

## Steel
Steel is an alloy made up of iron with typically a few tenths of a percent of carbon to improve its strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. Many other elements may be present or added. Stainless steels that are corrosion- and oxidation-resistant typically need an additional 11% chromium.Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, steel is used in buildings
