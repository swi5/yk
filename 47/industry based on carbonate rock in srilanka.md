## Modeling elastic properties in carbonate rocks | The Leading Edge
Carbonate (limestone and dolomite) reservoirs account for approximately 50% of oil and gas production worldwide. However, seismic responses in carbonate rocks are poorly understood. In addition, DHI ranking and AVO classification systems developed for clastic rocks are unlikely to be applicable to carbonate rocks. An accurate and physically sound carbonate rock physics model is needed to

## Carbonate-rock aquifers | U.S. Geological Survey
Aquifers in carbonate rocks are most extensive in the eastern U.S. Most of the carbonate-rock aquifers consist of limestone, but dolomite and marble locally yield water. The water-yielding properties of carbonate rocks vary widely; some yield almost no water and are considered to be confining units, whereas others are among the most productive aquifers known.

## Carbonate Rocks - Geology is the Way
Origin of carbonate sediments Calcium carbonate occurs dissolved in seawater and fresh waters. Calcium derives from the weathering of Ca-bearing minerals in rocks, like plagioclase, and it is present in water as Ca 2+ ions. Atmospheric CO 2 dissolves in water producing H 2 CO 3 (carbonic acid), a weak acid, following the reaction:. CO 2 (gas) + H 2 O(liquid) â H 2 CO 3
