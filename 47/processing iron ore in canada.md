Iron (Fe) is a naturally occurring element (CAS Number ) and is the 4 th most abundant element by mass in the earth's crust. Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron (Fe) can be extracted when heated in the presence of a reducing agent such as coke (NRCan 2012). The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and carbonates.
