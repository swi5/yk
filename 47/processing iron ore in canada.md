Iron (Fe) is a naturally occurring element (CAS Number ) and is the 4 th most abundant element by mass in the earth's crust. Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron (Fe) can be extracted when heated in the presence of a reducing agent such as coke (NRCan 2012). The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and carbonates.

Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better tumbling index when compared with the iron ore and it can be used as a substitute for the iron ore lumps both in the BF and for DRI production. Pellets have good reducibility since they have high porosity (25 % to 30 %).
