## Iron Ore | Geoscience Australia
In 2018, Australia's EDR of iron ore increased by 3% from 2017 to 49 604 Mt (Table 3). Similarly, there was a 4% EDR increase of contained iron to 24 122 Mt (Table 4). EDR attributable to magnetite deposits have decreased by 1%, likely due to re-assessment of projects and inactivity in the magnetite industry.

Iron ore is a mineral block found underground. It is a source of raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. Deepslate iron ore is a variant of iron ore that can generate in deepslate and tuff blobs. Iron ore itself can be obtained by mining it with a stone pickaxe or higher enchanted with Silk Touch. When mined without Silk Touch, iron ore drops raw iron. It is affected by the Fortune

Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon content (less than 0.08%) in contrast to that of cast iron (2.1% to 4%). It is a semi-fused mass of iron with fibrous slag inclusions (up to 2% by weight), which gives it a "grain" resembling wood that is visible when it is etched, rusted, or bent to the point of failure..

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## Iron ore (fines) - Cargo Handbook - the world's largest cargo transport 
Description. Iron Ore (fines) Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, deep purple, to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ), hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ), goethite (FeO
