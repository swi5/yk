## Marble Rock: Geology, Properties, Uses - ThoughtCo
Marble is a metamorphic rock formed when limestone is subjected to high pressure or heat. In its pure form, marble is a white stone with a crystalline and sugary appearance, consisting of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Usually, marble contains other minerals, including quartz, graphite, pyrite, and iron oxides.These minerals can give marble a pink, brown, gray, green, or variegated coloration.

## Dolomite: Identification, Pictures & Info for Rockhounds
Dolomite rock (or dolostone) is, by definition, made of over 50% calcium-magnesium carbonate (the mineral dolomite), usually in the form of well-defined crystals. Some calcite is also possible as a remnant of the dolomite's precursor, limestone. Fossils are common in dolomite, especially sea shells and coral.

Dolomite is a sedimentary stone, which means it was formed on the surface of the earth, as opposed to granite, for example, which is formed in magma chambers under the earthʼs surface. It can be found in abundance all over the world (as is the case in the Dolomite Alps in Italy) in sedimentary basins —which are warm, shallow, marine areas

## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? | Questions | Naked 
Yes, limestone reacts with acids. Limestone is calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). Carbonates react with acids according to the equation: However, the rate of the reaction will be determined by a number of factors. First, the strength of the acid. A strong acid, like hydrochloric acid, which readily ionises to produces a high concentration of hydrogen

Approximately 10% of sedimentary rock is limestone. It is the primary mineral in metamorphic marble. Where is calcite found? Description: Calcite is an abundant mineral found in many geological environments. It forms by precipitation from ground and surface waters, forming the major component of marls and limestone in the ocean, lakes and rivers.

Simply put, Dolomitic Limestone is just a variant of Limestone (a sedimentary rock), consisting of mainly magnesium calcium carbonate instead of calcite and aragonite.

Dolomite is both a mineral and a rock. The mineral is the pure form, and Dolomite rock is composed mostly of Dolomite, but also with impurities such as Calcite, Quartz, and Feldspar.

Dolomite ranks higher than marble on the durability scale, largely due to its dense mineral composition. Slightly hHarder than most marbles, dolomites tend to resist scratches and heat more readily.

Dolostone is the most important rock type that is composed mostly of it. Dolostone was probably originally limestone which was altered by Mg-bearing water circulating in the rocks. Dolomite does not precipitate out of aqueous solutions like calcite does (in normal circumstances). Carbonate rock is dolostone if at least 50 percent of it is dolomite.

Please note that Gravel Tech does NOT haul, sell, or deliver any gravel at all. We do however, provide the labor and equipment necessary to restore a gravel driveway using the existing driveway material.. The formula gravel pits use to calculate required tonnage for a 3" application is: Length x Width x Depth x 100 ÷ 2000 . eg: 600' x 10'x .25ft (or 3") = 1500.
