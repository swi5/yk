Ammonia, which does not emit CO 2 when burned, is an alternative fuel to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants. Therefore, under the Net Zero Scenario, ammonia co-firing is introduced at some coal-fired power plants by 2025. As with CCUS, co-firing ammonia can be particularly beneficial in regions where the thermal fleet is young.
