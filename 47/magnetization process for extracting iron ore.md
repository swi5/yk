The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

## The Process Of Extracting Iron Ore
The Process Of Extracting Iron Ore. The process of extracting iron from ore produces great quantities of poisonous and corrosive gases.In practice, these gases are scrubbed and recycled.Inevitably, however, some small amounts of toxic gases escape to the atmosphere.A byproduct of iron purification is slag, which is produced in huge amounts.
