## 5 Important Iron Ore Beneficiation Process Introduction
Beneficiation process. Magnetite is the most important iron ore mineral. Cut-off grade is 20%, and the industrial grade is 25%. There are usually 3 magnetite beneficiation methods: (1) Single weak magnetic separation. (2) Weak magnetic separation - reverse flotation. (3) Weak magnetic-strong magnetic-flotation combined process.

## Process for scavenging iron from tailings produced by flotation 
There is disclosed a process for scavenging iron from tailings produced by the flotation beneficiation of iron ore. This process includes the step of scavenging the flotation tailings using wet high-intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS). There is also disclosed a process for increasing the recovery of iron ore in a flotation beneficiation process.

## 5 Refractory Iron Ore Beneficiation Processes - Xinhai
01 Refractory siderite beneficiation method. The grade (theoretical grade) of siderite is low, only 48.02%, and it is often symbiotic with calcium, magnesium and manganese. The available beneficiation methods for this type of iron ore include gravity separation, strong magnetic separation, flotation, roasting and combined beneficiation.
