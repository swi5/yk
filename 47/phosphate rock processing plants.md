## Chemical Processing of Phosphate - Florida Poly
Chemical Processing of Phosphate. The phosphate mineral as it exists in the ground is not soluble and is hard for the plant to access. To provide the plant with the phosphate it needs, in a form it can take up through its roots, the phosphate rock is converted to phosphoric acid. It is that acid that is used to make fertilizer.

Nine phosphate mines are currently active. Nine mines are 100 percent reclaimed and released from reclamation obligations. The remaining mines are either not started or are shut down. Phosphate mines typically range in size from approximately 5,000 to 100,000 acres. Phosphate mining disturbs between 3,000 to 6,000 acres annually in Florida.
