## What Does Silver Look Like In Rocks - Realonomics
How do you tell if a rock has silver in it? Bright white quartz with streaks of gray are a good indicator of the presence of silver ore.

Re: Which rocks contain metallic flakes resembling silver and gold? « Reply #1 on: 29/07/2017 18:38:42 ». The most likely candidate for the silver and gold flakes are iron sulphides - also known as iron pyrites or, "fools gold". Lead sulphide (galena) also produces silvery inclusions that would fit the bill with what you describe.

## Quartz Mineral | Photos, Uses, Properties, Pictures - Geology
Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.

## Geology of Silver | Properties, Mining, and Formation of Silver
1 day agoThe main sources of silver are mined as an ore of copper, copper-nickel, lead, and lead-zinc. In nature, silver is more likely to be found as a compound.  A rock containing silver will have a dark, almost sooty appearance or dark crystals within the rock.  Silver can also be found mixed with quartz and ruby crystal formations. Silver and
