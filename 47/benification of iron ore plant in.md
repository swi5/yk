## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## What is the Beneficiation Process?
Oct 1 2014. The beneficiation process can be defined as a treatment process of ore which results in a more concentrated form of the product. It is often used in the preparation of iron ore for smelting. This is an essential process as it helps improve the yield from a deposit of ore, thereby increasing the potential profits that can be obtained
