##  "Computer Aided Design of Jaw crusher"
The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws .For instance, a 22 x 30 jaw crusher has an opening of 22" by 30", a 46 x 46 jaw crusher has a opening of 46" square. Generally primary jaw crushers have the square opening design, and secondary jaw crushers have rectangular opening design.

Rock Crusher History. History tells us, it was in 1830, the first US patent was issued on a rock crushing machine. It covered a device which, in a crude way, incorporated the drop hammer principle later used in the famous stamp mill, whose history is so intimately linked with that of the golden age of mining. In 1840, another patent was issued
