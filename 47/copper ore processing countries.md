The production of concentrates implies the crushing and later milling of the ore down to a particle size allows releasing copper by flotation. The concentrates from different regions have approximately between 24% up to 36% of copper. Copper concentrates are then submitted to a final filtration and drying process to decrease the humidity to 8-9%.

It has to be mentioned that since the 1990s, China has become a major country in the lithium industry. But there is a large technological gap in lithium ore mining. With the entry of foreign advanced technology of salt lake brine extraction, China has improved the technological progress of lithium extraction from salt lakes.

Crushing and milling account for just over 50% of copper mine site energy consumption 3 making them a primary target for cost reduction. The goal is to grind the ore just enough for optimum copper mineral liberation in the froth flotation plant circuit. Under-grinding reduces recovery; overgrinding reduces throughput and wastes energy.

The principal copper ore mineral is chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) which is commonly smelted to yield a matte containing ~50% copper. What is copper ore used for? Most copper mined today is used to conduct electricity - mostly as wiring. It is also an excellent conductor of heat and is used in cooking utensils heat sinks and heat exchangers.
