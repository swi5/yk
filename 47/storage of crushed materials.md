Please note that Gravel Tech does NOT haul, sell, or deliver any gravel at all. We do however, provide the labor and equipment necessary to restore a gravel driveway using the existing driveway material.. The formula gravel pits use to calculate required tonnage for a 3" application is: Length x Width x Depth x 100 ÷ 2000 . eg: 600' x 10'x .25ft (or 3") = 1500.

## Frequent Questions About Universal Waste | US EPA
Dec 9, 2021Crushing is the intentional breaking of fluorescent and other mercury lamps for the purpose of volume reduction. Crushing reduces the physical volume of lamps but does not recover any mercury. Crushing is not recycling, but it can be a step in the process when the crushed material is further treated by a recycling process that includes retorting.
