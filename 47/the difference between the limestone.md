## What Can Limestone Deposits Tell Scientists About The Environment In 
How did limestone originate? Limestone is formed in two ways. It can be formed with the help of living organisms and by evaporation. Ocean-dwelling organisms such as oysters clams mussels and coral use calcium carbonate (CaCO3) found in seawater to create their shells and bones. . The water pressure compacts the sediment creating limestone.

## What is the difference between chalk, limestone and marble?
Limestone is formed in a shallower marine environment from the bodies of corals and shells, as well as the shells of microscopic sea life. Since it contains large lumps, it does not form such a fine white powder as chalk. Marble is metamorphosed limestone, ie subjected to heat and pressure, the crystals grow and interlock, forming a stronger

The quicklime is then mixed with small amounts of water to create hydrated lime, which may be included in cement or mixed with water for use as mortar. Lime hardens by slowly absorbing carbon dioxide and turning back to limestone over time. Cement consists of highly reactive silica-containing compounds -- when mixed with water, they harden quickly.
