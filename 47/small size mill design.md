Extrapolating designs is a lot harder and challenging than using interpolation to make a mid-size equipment. When the first 42 foot SAG mill was designed and manufactured around, there were a lot of issues with getting such big equipment pieces fabricated and machined. The costs go up exponentially as we try to push the envelope.

## Small scale milling trials to modify particle size distribution
Small differences between Small scale mill and MACRO-PACTOR can be observed in the extent of the strongest particle fraction between 1000 µm and 1400 µm, which lead to a slight shift of the particle size distribution towards coarser particles for the Small Scale Mill. The extent of this small deviation seems to be material specific.

Step 2: Building the Base. In this mill design, the base of the mill contains the Y axis. To approximately match the length of the axles, I made the base 3.25" square. To make the rails for the platform to slide on, I drilled 4 holes through opposite sides so that the axles fit parallel to each other at the same height.
