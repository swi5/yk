Political instability in an inconspicuous West African Guinea can have a major impact on the global balance of the aluminum market. The price of bauxite, from which the metal is made, has climbed to an 18-month high due to the coup in Guinea. The price of bauxite traveling to China has risen to more than $ 50 a tonne, the highest level since March last year.
