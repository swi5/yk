## How can metal mining impact the environment?
Underground mining generally results in relatively small waste rock disposal areas ranging from a few acres in size to tens of acres (0.1 km2). These areas are typically located near the openings of the underground workings. Open pit mining disturbs larger areas than underground mining, and thus has larger visual and physical impacts.

Iron ore is a common ore found almost everywhere in a Minecraft world. Iron ore generates around and below sea-level in the Overworld. It is a crucial material to gather during the early stages of the game since it can be made into a pickaxe, capable of mining all types of ores (including diamond ore). Every iron ore block contains enough iron to make one iron ingot when it is smelted. Iron

## Mining of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Mining of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a type of mineral and rock from which metallic iron is extracted economically. This ore is normally rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow and deep purple to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite
