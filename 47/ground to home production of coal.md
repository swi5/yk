## Ground water monitoring of underground coal mines
The implementation of new US Federal regulations for ground water monitoring of underground coal mines has given rise to considerable confusion. On the basis of some 30 monitoring plans for existing mines in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, the salient requirements of a monitoring programme are set out.  and to measure carbon

Global steel production is dependent on coal and more and more the world is turning to Canada for its supply of quality steel-making coal. For example, to meet its rapid infrastructure growth and consumer demand for things such as vehicles and home appliances, Asia has turned to Canada for its high-quality steel-making coal.

After the coal is mined, they put back the dirt and rock. Th ey plant trees and grass. Th e land can then be used again. Th is is called reclamation. If the coal is deep in the ground, tunnels called mine shafts are dug down to the coal. Machines dig the coal and carry it to the surface. Some mine shafts are 1,000 feet deep.

Steam coal, also known as thermal coal, is suitable for electric power production. Steam coal is ground into a fine powder that burns quickly at high heat and is used in power plants to heat water in boilers that run steam turbines. It also may be used to provide space heating for homes and businesses.

Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) takes advantage of the same chemical reactions of coal to produce product gases, as those occurring in conventional gasifier reactors. The main difference is that in UCG the underground coal seam itself becomes the reactor, so that the gasification of the coal takes place underground instead of in a manufactured gasification vessel at the surface.1 Obviously
