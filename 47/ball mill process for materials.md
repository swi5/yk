## Ball mills
A ball mill uses the impact of metal or ceramic balls, falling from near the top of a horizontal shell to crush the material into fine particles. The outer cylindrical shell rotates to lift the grinding balls to the top from where they fall; grinding and blending the materials at the same time. Ball mills are typically used in the ceramic, glass, paint, pyrotechnics, and porcelain industries

Union Process Attritor Mill. The attritor mill is a wet grinding attrition mill. It differs from conventional ball mills as it uses much smaller media with diameter less than 5mm, leading to greater media-material contact area. Additionally, the attritor mill works at a higher rotation speed up to SPEED.

A device used to reduce the particle size of materials, bodies or glazes. A ball mill is simply a container that is filled with pebbles (either of porcelain or stones e.g. Flint) into which a charge (powder or slurry) is put and that is then mechanically rotated to cause the tumbling pebbles to crush particles that happen between them.

Offset hosel: By moving the clubface slightly back from the hosel, it means players need less forward shaft lean (getting their hands in front of the ball) in order to square the leading edge at impact. It also makes it harder to slice the ball, which is a common miss for high handicappers. Cavity back clubhead: Cavity back irons, in contrast.
