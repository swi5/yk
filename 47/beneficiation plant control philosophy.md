The choice of the beneficiation treatment depends on the nature of the gangue present and its association with the ore structure. Several methods/techniques such as washing, jigging, magnetic separation, gravity separation, and flotation etc. are used to enhance the Fe content of the Iron ore and to reduce its gangue content.

Indian mining industries primarily depend upon high-grade fines mainly because of two factors, one is lack of beneficiation infrastructure and high cost of low-grade fines, the second one is lack of proper tail disposal system. Due to lapses in our policies, miners get better premium by selling high-grade fines over low-grade fines. This restricts the flow of low-grade fines into the market

## Coal beneficiation technology to reduce hazardous heavy metals in fly 
coal beneficiation is a process to remove mineral matters and sulfide minerals from the coal to meet the market criteria such as ash, moisture, sulfur, and heat content ( noble and luttrell, 2015, miller, 2017 ), and coal with a higher heating value is obtained after the beneficiation as the ash and sulfide-bearing minerals are removed from the .

## Control Narrative - Piping Designer
A system control philosophy is a document that is used to describe general principles of operation. Variables such as alarm set points or shutdown values are usually described in the Control Narrative. A control philosophy solidifies basic definitions, principles and processes during the design and implementation of a process.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
A typical flow sheet for iron ore beneficiation plant is shown in Fig 1.  Point control minimizes the total water requirements by efficiently directing water into the flowing pulp at the most effective angle. Feed size applicability is in the range of 0.3 mm to 1 mm. Spirals are normally operated at a pulp density of 25 % to 30 % solids.
