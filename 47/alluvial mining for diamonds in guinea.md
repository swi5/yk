## Could Africa Become the Next Bitcoin Mining Hub?
A cryptocurrency that has gained significant traction since its creation in 2009, Bitcoin mining involves the creation of new bitcoins through deciphering complicated mathematic equations that verify and process the currency's transactions, thus resulting in the exchange of Bitcoin for the miner as payment. A global surge in interest in Bitcoin mining, in conjunction with [.]

## How Diamonds Are Mined - RockHer
Alluvial diamond mining occurs in riverbeds and beaches, where thousands of years of erosion and natural forces such as wind, rain, and water currents wash diamonds from their primary deposits in kimberlite pipes to beaches and riverbeds. Some alluvial deposits are from long-ago rivers. Mining alluvial deposits can be as simple as panning

## The Catastrophic Effects Of Mining Diamonds | Ethica Diamonds UK
The 3 standard types of diamond mining include open-pit mining, hard-rock mining and alluvial mining. There's also marine diamond mining which is extremely damaging since eco-systems that haven't even been fully understood are being destroyed. Each year, over 150 million carats of diamonds are extracted from the Earth through mining.

Guinea: 100: Other Countries: 140: These values are estimated gem-quality diamond production in thousands of carats from USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries [1].  That discovery triggered a diamond rush and extensive alluvial diamond mining activity. The diamonds were distributed through vast amounts of unconsolidated sediment.

## Mining industry of Guinea
The mining industry of Guinea was developed during colonial rule.The minerals extracted consisted of iron, gold, diamond, and bauxite. Guinea ranks first in the world in bauxite reserves and 6th in the extraction of high-grade bauxite, the aluminium ore. The mining industry and exports of mining products accounted for 17% of Guinea's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010.

INTRODUCTION TO AFRICA. Africa is the second largest continent in the world after Eurasia (Europe and Asia). It covers a total area of about 30.300,300 km2 and it extends between 350 N and 34o S of the Equator. The Equator divides Africa into almost two equal parts. Africa is the only continent where the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn cross the land mass.

## Investigating the origin of alluvial diamonds in the North  - Geoscience
Alluvial mining in the area started in the early 19 th century. Renewed interest in the mining of alluvial diamonds was generated by the El Niño related drought of 1974 when many farmers turned to diamond mining. Much larger volumes of gravel could be moved and greater depths of gravel were reached owing to modern earth moving and sorting
