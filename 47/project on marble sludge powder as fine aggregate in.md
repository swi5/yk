## Effect of Marble Sludge Powder and Quarry Rock Dust as Partial 
Concrete sustainability involves continuously choosing low impact building materials. Use of alternate aggregate materials has greater potential because 75% of concrete is composed of aggregates. The experimental study has been carried out to investigate the suitability of marble sludge powder and quarry rock dust as partial replacements for fine aggregates. This paper reports the properties

## Study of the Effects of Marble Powder Amount on the Self  - Hindawi
Study of the Effects of Marble Powder Amount on the Self-Compacting Concretes Properties by Microstructure Analysis on Cement-Marble Powder Pastes: The marble powder (MP), obtained from waste sludge marble processing, has a high specific surface area; this could mean that it can be used as filler added to self-compacting concrete (SCC). The aim of this experimental work is to study the effects

##  An Experimental Investigation on Fiber Reinforced Foam Concrete - Ijsdr
Waste marble powder can be used either as filler or as fine aggregate in concrete and helps to reduce the total void content in concrete. In concrete waste marble powder can be used as an admixture, so that the strength can be altered. In this project, the marble sludge powder used as filler material and collected at sivakasi.

The replacement of fine aggregate with 50% marble sludge powder and 50% Quarry rock dust (Green concrete) gives an excellent result in strength aspect and quality aspect. Increase the marble sludge powder content by more than 50% improves the workability but affects the compressive and split tensile strength of concrete. Read More

##  Chloride Penetration Study On Self-Compacting Green Concrete  - NDT
The maximum size of fine aggregate was taken to be 4.75 mm. The testing of sand was done as per Indian Standard Specifications IS: 383 -1970[7]. 3.1.3 Marble Sludge Powder (MSP) MSP was obtained in wet form directly taken from deposits of Marble factories. Wet MSP must be dried before the sample preparation. MSP contains several Marble

## Properties of Green Concrete Containing Quarry Rock Dust and Marble 
Green concrete capable for sustainable development is characterized by application of industrial wastes to reduce consumption of natural resources and energy and pollution of the environment. Marble sludge powder can be used as filler and helps to reduce the total voids content in concrete. Natural sand in many parts of the country is not graded properly and has excessive silt on other hand
