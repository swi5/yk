As such, when the product is sticky, rod mills are preferred over ball mills. Rod mills have an industrial yield that is less than that of a ball mill, which explains the fact that balls have a much larger grinding surface than rods. The power needed to operate a rod mill could exceed 30% of the power used in a ball mill.
