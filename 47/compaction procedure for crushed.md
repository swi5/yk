## Compaction properties of different soils and suitable solutions
The compaction properties of gravel and sand are influenced by the water content; compaction is most effective when there is ideal water content. If the fine content is less than 5 to 10%, the soil is considered free draining. In free-draining soils, excess water is drained off during compaction. This means that, in certain circumstances, the
