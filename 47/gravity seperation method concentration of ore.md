## Separation process
A separation process is a method that converts a mixture or a solution of chemical substances into two or more distinct product mixtures, a scientific process of distinguishing two or more substance in order to obtain purity. At least one product mixture from the separation is enriched in one or more of the source mixture's constituents. In some cases, a separation may fully divide the mixture

## Gravity separation
Gravity separation is an industrial method of separating two components, either a suspension, or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical: i.e. the components of the mixture have different specific weight. All of the gravitational methods are common in the sense that they all use gravity as the dominant force.

Heavy media separation is a gravity separation process that crush ores into a certain size, and make the density of the fluid heavier than water (that is heavy medium). According to the Archimedes' principle of buoyancy, when density is less than media, ore particles will float; when the density is greater than media, ore particles will sink.
