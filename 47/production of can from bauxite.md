What can be made from bauxite? Bauxite refineries produce alumina (aluminum oxide) which is used to create aluminum metal. Bauxite is also used to manufacture other industrial products such as abrasives cement and chemicals.There are two operating bauxite refineries in the United States both of which are located in Louisiana.

Oct 6, 2021The Bayer Process, which is used by about 80 active plants worldwide, is the primary method of producing aluminum from bauxite. Bauxite ore is dissolved in sodium hydroxide, or lye, at a high temperature and pressure. Then, the alumina and bauxite ores are separated by washing out the waste (red muds or sands) from the alumina.

Production. Aluminum does not exist in a pure state in nature. The production of primary aluminum metal begins with bauxite ore, which is composed of hydrated aluminum oxide (40% to 60%) mixed with silica and iron oxide. It takes approximately 4 to 5 tonnes of bauxite ore to produce 2 tonnes of alumina.

Each of these countries has sufficient reserves to sustain production for many years. Some have enough reserves to last for almost a century.

##  30 Bauxite and Alumina - Usgs
BAUXITE AND ALUMINA1 (Data in thousand metric dry tons unless otherwise noted) Domestic Production and Use: In 2019, the quantity of bauxite consumed was estimated to be 5.1 million tons, 30% more than that reported in 2018, with an estimated value of about $162 million. About 73% of the bauxite was refined

## ARTICLE: Addressing the Challenge of Bauxite Residue
Though alumina can be produced from bauxite by other chemical processes, the Bayer process is the main industrial route for metallurgical alumina production, as it is the most economical process for purification of bauxite that contains a considerable amount of Fe 2 O 3. Over 95% of the alumina produced globally is derived from bauxite using

## Profiling the top five bauxite producing countries in the world
The projected growth of Australia's bauxite production until is estimated at 122 Mt. 2. China - 68 million metric tonnes. Second on the list of bauxite producers is China, which had an annual production of about 68 million metric tonnes in 2019. That total was more than half of the 124 Mt produced in Asia as a whole.
