## Power plant - Energy Education
Français. A power plant is an industrial facility that generates electricity from primary energy. Most power plants use one or more generators that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy [1] in order to supply power to the electrical grid for society's electrical needs. The exception is solar power plants, which use photovoltaic

In the power plant, the fission takes place in the reactor and the middle of the reactor is known as the core that includes uranium fuel, and this can be formed into pellets of ceramic. Every pellet generates 150 gallons of oil energy. The total energy generated from the pellets is stacked in metal fuel rods.
