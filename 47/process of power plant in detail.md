## Power plant - Energy Education
Fran√ßais. A power plant is an industrial facility that generates electricity from primary energy. Most power plants use one or more generators that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy [1] in order to supply power to the electrical grid for society's electrical needs. The exception is solar power plants, which use photovoltaic
