Pipe inspection is the process of examining an asset using non-destructive techniques (NDT), often for metal loss, and most commonly takes place at the installation stage or during production. Pipes need to be inspected for a number of reasons, usually to ensure that the asset is fit for purpose and doesn't.

To have an idea of bioleaching process copper leaching by bacteria is described as an example. Covellite, chalcocite and chalcopyrite are generally used as copper ores for bioleaching processes. Apart from containing copper, the ores also contain other elements like iron, zinc and sulphur. For example - Chalcopyrite contains 26% copper, 25.9%

## Copper extraction
All primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being chalcocite), are subjected to smelting.Some vat leach or pressure leach processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting leachate solution, but this is a minor part of the market.. Carbonate concentrates are a relatively minor product

The leaching is carried out in an acidic sulphate medium and may include oxidation by oxygen-containing gas. The leached copper is then recovered, for example by solvent extraction and electrowinning. The leaching process can result in the virtually complete extraction of copper at atmospheric pressure in as little as four hours.

## Outotec copper concentrate pressure leaching process
The complete copper pressure leaching process concept includes pressure leaching in an autoclave to produce copper-containing pregnant leach solution. Leaching is followed by a neutralization step and then copper solvent extraction and electrowinning. Gold and silver can be recovered by adding a lime boil step before cyanide leaching.

2.1 Leaching. Most copper leaching is done by piling broken ore (∼0.5% Cu) into flat-surface, 3-10m high, 10 4 -10 5 m 2 heaps of ore and then sprinkling dilute sulfuric acid lixiviant on to the heap surface. The lixiviant trickles down through the heap and leaches copper from its minerals to produce a pregnant leach solution containing 1-5kg Cum −3.
