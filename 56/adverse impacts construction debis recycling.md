## What Can We Do About Construction and Demolition Waste?
When contractors tear down buildings, wind can carry loose dust and debris, leaving it to settle in the area or even miles away. Depending on what this dust is made of, it could have an adverse effect on public health. Moreover, many cities don't enforce laws related to minimizing exposure to demolition contaminants like asbestos or lead.
