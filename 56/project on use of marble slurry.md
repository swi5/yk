## Sustainable use of marble slurry in concrete - ScienceDirect
Particle size distribution of coarse and fine aggregates is as shown in Fig. 2. Sand of Banas River was used as fine aggregate for concrete mixes. The MS was collected at a dumpsite near a marble processing plant in Kishangargh, Rajasthan. The different samples of MS displayed an in-situ water content of 1-2%.
