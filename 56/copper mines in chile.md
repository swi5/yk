## Mining in Chile
The mining sector in Chile is one of the pillars of Chilean economy and copper exports alone stands for more than one third of government income. Most mining in Chile is concentrated to the Norte Grande region spanning most of the Atacama Desert.Mining products of Chile includes copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, iron and coal.Chile was, in 2019, the world's largest producer of copper, iodine

Investors who make use of the Top Thirty Shorted Stocks List that appears weekly on thebull.au have noticed the absence of three of the top miners on the ASX with lithium mining as their primary focus - Pilbara Minerals (PLS), Orocobre (ORE), and Galaxy Minerals (GXY). By the company's estimates, it could see lithium sales volumes adding up to around 100,000 metric tons in 2021.
