## How much copper has been found in the world? - USGS
To date, roughly 700 million metric tons of copper have been produced around the world. This would fit into a cube measuring about 430 meters on a side. Identified deposits contain an estimated 2.1 billion metric tons of additional copper, which brings the total amount of discovered copper to 2.8 billion metric tons. This would fit into a cube measuring 680 meters on a side.

## Peak copper
Reserves. Copper is a fairly common element, with an estimated concentration of 50-70 ppm (0.005-0.007 percent) in earth's crust (1 kg of copper per 15-20 tons of crustal rock). A concentration of 60 ppm would multiply out to 1.66 quadrillion tonnes over the 2.77 × 10 22 kg mass of the crust, or over 90 million years' worth at the 2013 production rate of 18.3 MT per year.
