Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.

Silica sand mining is the process of mining to extract silica sands to be used for glass, solar panels and fracking. Very little of Manitoba's silica sand is of a pure enough quality for glass and solar panels. Cleaning sand to reach that quality is a very polluting process as it creates acid drainage.

Sources of Silica Sand: SiO2 is the chemical sign of silica and it is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Oxygen and Silicon. This sand is often got in the crystalline state and because of weathering, plankton fossilization takes place and that results in crystallizing SiO2. In most regions of the world, these are found as mines and it is obtained in high hardness.

Industrial Sand Mining. Industrial sand is a term normally applied to high-purity silica sand products with closely controlled sizing. Industrial sand is a more precisely sized and shape-graded product than common sand used as aggregates in construction materials, such as concrete and asphalt. Typically, sand is composed predominantly of quartz

The specifications for each use vary, but silica resources for most uses are abundant. In almost all cases, silica mining uses open pit or dredging mining methods with standard mining equipment. Except for temporarily disturbing the immediate area while mining operations are active, sand and gravel mining usually has limited environmental impact.
