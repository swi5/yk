## gravel roads construction and maintenance guide - Free Engineering Pdfs
PREFACE: Good gravel road maintenance or rehabilitation depends on two basic principles: proper use of a motorgrader (or other grading device) and use of good surface gravel. The use of the grader to properly shape the road is obvious to almost everyone, but the quality, volume, and size distribution of gravel needed is not as well understood.

## Building a Great Gravel Road: 10 Basic Principles
A lot depends on the road construction equipment that is used. Like in the case of any other type of road construction project, gravel roads also need the right machinery which can build quality road and extend its service life. Not only having the right equipment is important but it is equally necessary to hire an experienced equipment operator.
