Chhattisgarh is the only tin producing State in India. Tin ore is known as cassiterite, which was reported in Dantewara district (Bastar district in formerly Madhya Pradesh) by the Directorate of Geology and Mining associated with the lepidolite bearing pegmatites. Cassiterite bearing pegmatites are reportedly rich in collumbite and tantalite, which are ore of rare metals niobium and tantalum
