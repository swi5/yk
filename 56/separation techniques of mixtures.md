This often involves finding a way in which the parts of the mixture are different from each other. Floating. Floating is a separation technique in which a "lighter" component rises to the top of a liquid where it can be skimmed or poured off. Settling. Settling is a separation technique in which a "heavier" component sinks to the bottom

## Separation: Definition, Methods, Complete and Incomplete Separation
A separation is a method that converts a mixture or solution of chemical substances into two or more distinct product mixtures. At least one of the results of the separation is a supplement in one or more of the source mixture's constituents. In some cases, a separation process may fully divide the mixture into its pure constituents.

## Methods Of Separation: Sublimation, Distillation, Crystallization & Other
The components of a heterogeneous mixture can be separated by simple physical methods such as: • Hand-picking. • Sieving. • Filtration, and.. • Using Magnet etc. However, sometimes the components of a mixture cannot be separated by simple methods. In such cases, some special techniques are employed.

Filtration apparatus. Filtration procedure: 1) the mixture is pored through a funnel lined with a filter paper, 2) the filtrate (liquid) drips through to the filter flask, 3) the solid remains in the funnel. Though chromatography is a simple technique in principle, it remains the most important method for the separation of mixtures into its

The components of a mixture are not chemically combined. Therefore, they can be separated by physical methods; the components of a mixture will still contain their properties. Methods used to separate mixtures depend on the physical differences between the components of the mixture. The main separation techniques include: Filtration
