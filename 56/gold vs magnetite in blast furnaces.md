## magnetite blast furnace
Blast furnace is a furnace for smelting of iron from iron oxide ores (hematite, Fe 2 O 3 or magnetite, Fe 3 O 4 ). Coke, limestone and iron ore are poured in the top, which would normally burn only on the surface. The hot air blast to the furnace burns the coke and maintains the very high temperatures that are needed to reduce the ore to iron.

## Superheating vs furnace. : r/2007scape - reddit
You should try out blast furnace. It's a group activity in which you and others operate a furnace. It's useful because it uses half the amount of coal per bar. Ex: Mithril bars are 2 coal/1 ore only at the BF. Thus you make as much profit as possible with less work than manually smelting, and your not wasting 215gp~ per smelt with superheating.

## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

A blast furnace is a block that smelts ores, raw metals, iron and gold armor and tools, similar to a furnace. A blast furnace smelts items at a speed of one item every 100 game ticks (5 seconds) or twelve items per minute, which is twice as fast as a standard furnace. It also serves as an armorer's job site block. A blast furnace can be picked up by any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it
