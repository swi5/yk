Another often used material is boron-nitride (BN). BN belongs, in the form of fibers or nanotubes, to the materials with high absorption capacity for electromagnetic radiation [67,68]. An advantage of this material is that boron nitride is generally suggested by NASA as fibrous reinforcement for spacesuits and so on .

Basalt is a type of igneous rock formed by the rapid cooling of lava at the surface of a planet. It is the most common rock in the Earth's crust. Basalt rock characteristics vary from the source of lava, cooling rate, and historical exposure to the elements. High quality fibers are made from basalt deposits with uniform chemical makeup.

## Aluminum-coated, multifilament yarn shields against electromagnetic 
Instead of preventing ER interference via metal fiber fabrics â which the companies note is a time- and energy-consuming procedure â the new material uses a fiber core made of melted, thinly drawn basalt, which is coated with aluminum and bundled into AluCoat yarn. This yarn reportedly remains just as conductive and provides the same amount
