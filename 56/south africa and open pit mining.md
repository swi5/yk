## Open Cast Mining in South Africa - SG
Open cast mining is a useful method of extracting ore near the surface. It allows teams to fast track box cut excavations on gold, platinum and uranium mines as it saves the need for the usual methodological approach. In this article we'll look at what we mean by open cast mining, along with its uses in South Africa. What is Open Cast Mining? Open cast mining, also known as open-pit mining

Most of the PGE mines under operation in South Africa run at a depth between 500 m and 2000 m . Among all the mines, underground mining presents the most common technique, whereas open pit mining accounts for a minor share of production. Nevertheless, the share of open pit mining increased from 23% to 33% of processed material from 2010 to 2015.
