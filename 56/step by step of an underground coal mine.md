## Step By Step Of An Underground Coal Mine
Step By Step Of An Underground Coal Mine. · The first step in underground mining is development mining, in which shafts are dug into the site to make the ore accessible. During this phase, along with shafts, things like electricity are installed, along with lifts and shoring to support the walls of the mine so that it will not collapse.

In particular, surface mining is used to retrieve sand, gravel, stones, coal, iron and other metals. There are five recognized types of surface mining, each with specific variations depending on the minerals being extracted. These include strip mining, open-pit mining, mountaintop removal, dredging and highwall mining.

Coal mining has impacts on superficial and underground waters, soil, local land use and native flora and fauna. Each mine must have a reclamation or rehabilitation plan that covers all the phases of the mine lifecycle. The reclamation activities must be undertaken gradually: the land contour must be restored, the topsoil replaced and vegetation replanted [.]

Fifty years ago when most coal mining was done manually, underground mines accounted for 96 percent of the coal produced each year. Today, almost 60 percent is produced from surface mines. Most underground mines in the United States are located east of the Mississippi River, although there are some in the West, particularly in Utah and Colorado.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.
