## Quarrying | Process and Equipment | Applications | Epiroc
A quarry is typically defined as being a surface excavation for the production of rock as the principal product. As such, it differs from an open cast, open-cut, surface or open-pit mine in that the rock itself is the valuable commodity, rather than a specific mineral within the rock mass. Quarrying is used mainly in the production of

By managing these processes efficiently, quarry sites can process more product faster, while lowering their water bill and eliminating the need for double handling. Most quarries use water in the washing

## Quarrying | Process and Equipment | Applications | Epiroc US
Quarrying is used mainly in the production of construction and building materials, such as solid stone or crushed rock for aggregates, or for raw materials for processes such as cement manufacture. As a technique, quarrying is normally only used where raw materials of adequate quality and size cannot be obtained economically by other means.

Limestone mining is done out in the open. Once studies show the existence of stone at the site, the extraction is made by separating the rock in quarry benches and dividing it into blocks. Before beginning the quarrying process, a resource analysis is made. This study investigates the existence and quantity of stone at the site and also the economic viability of the process.

## Why the future of quarry management is now
One way to address these concerns is by improving process management. At its most basic, quarrying is a three-step manufacturing operation: extraction, material processing and loading. And much like any manufacturing activity, Lean and Six Sigma techniques enable the identification and removal of waste and minimize impact variability.

Drilling and blasting is one of the first operations to be carried out in a quarry to gain the material for further processing. The vital process often starts with a detailed survey of the quarry face, which will enable the explosives engineer to design the blast and to plot where the shot holes should be drilled, enabling the task to be carried out safely and efficiently.
