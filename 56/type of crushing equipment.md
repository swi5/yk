A jaw crusher is a compression type of crusher. Feed material is reduced by squeezing it between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel, with the discharge size controlled by the gap setting, ie the space between those two pieces of steel. The tighter the setting, the smaller the output size and the lower the throughput capacity.
