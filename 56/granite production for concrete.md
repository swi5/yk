## The process uses a specialized spray gun to apply the fluid
Concrete was produced by replacing general-purpose cement with 10%, 20% and 30% of recycled glass powder. The results were compared with the control (100% Portland cement) and fly ash blend (30% fly ash) concrete. The effects of glass powder on compressive, flexural and tensile strength of concrete were evaluated.

## Economic Exploitation of Gravel in Place of Granite in Concrete Production
The paper investigated the application of gravel as partial economic replacement of granite in concrete production. Concrete was produced using granite/gravel combination in varying percentages of 90/10, 80/20, 70/30, 60/40, 50/50, 40/60, 30/70, 20/80 and 10/90. Concrete made from 100 % granite and 100 % gravel served controls while other constituents of concrete were kept constant.

The manufacture of concrete is fairly simple. First, the cement (usually Portland cement) is prepared. Next, the other ingredientsâ€”aggregates (such as sand or gravel), admixtures (chemical additives), any necessary fibers, and waterâ€”are mixed together with the cement to form concrete. The concrete is then shipped to the work site and placed
