## Concentration Of Ore: Types, Procedures, Extraction - Collegedunia
Concentration of ore can be explained as a method by which gangue is separated from the ore of the metal.  Ans. Native silver or gold or Argentite is finely powdered. This is treated with a dilute solution of sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide and the air current is passed through. Silver forms soluble cyanides and impurities are filtered.

The silver in the oxidative silver-manganese ore can be concentrated with united technologies of beneficiation and metallurgy, under the condition of strong magnetic field silver and manganese can be separated from other ores by two steps magnetic separation. The manganese in concentrate of magnetic separation was solved in H 2SO 4 solution as iron chippings and shavings was used, the recovery
