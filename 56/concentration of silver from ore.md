Concentration of ore can be explained as a method by which gangue is separated from the ore of the metal.  Ans. Native silver or gold or Argentite is finely powdered. This is treated with a dilute solution of sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide and the air current is passed through. Silver forms soluble cyanides and impurities are filtered.
