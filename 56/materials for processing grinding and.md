## Abrasive water jet tool passivation: from mechanism to application
The abrasive water jet passivation (AWJP) is one of the most commonly used processes for carbide, ceramic and steel materials tools. Nevertheless, the complex action law from passivation to machining performance is indistinct, which makes passivation parameters rely on empirical summaries.
