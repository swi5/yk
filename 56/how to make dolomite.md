## Dolomite
Dolomite is the name given to limestone containing a certain proportion of magnesium. It is also referred to as dolomitic limestone (chemical formula CaMg (CO3) 2). Sibelco glass-grade dolomite is used in float glass production to improve resistance to natural or chemical attack or weathering.

## dolomite | Formation, Structure, Properties, Uses, & Facts
dolomite, type of limestone, the carbonate fraction of which is dominated by the mineral dolomite, calcium magnesium carbonate [CaMg(CO3)2]. Along with calcite and aragonite, dolomite makes up approximately 2 percent of the Earth's crust. The bulk of the dolomite constitutes dolostone formations that occur as thick units of great areal extent in many sequences of chiefly marine strata.

## Dolomite 101: Natural Stone that is Elegant and Durable
Dolomite is a sedimentary stone, which means it was formed on the surface of the earth, as opposed to granite, for example, which is formed in magma chambers under the earthʼs surface. It can be found in abundance all over the world (as is the case in the Dolomite Alps in Italy) in sedimentary basins —which are warm, shallow, marine areas

## Dolomite (rock)
Dolomite (also known as dolomite rock, dolostone or dolomitic rock) is a sedimentary carbonate rock that contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2.It occurs widely, often in association with limestone and evaporites, though it is less abundant than limestone and rare in Cenozoic rock beds (beds less than about 66 million years in age).

## Dolomite for Container Gardening - Simply Love Gardening
Dolomite is a limestone compound in powder form that comprises magnesium and calcium. The best dolomite mixture will have 8-12% magnesium and 18-22% calcium. Magnesium and calcium help balance the pH of the potting soil you use for your container gardening projects. Some dolomite mixture also has sodium; however, this should only be 0.2% maximum.
