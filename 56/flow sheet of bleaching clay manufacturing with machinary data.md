## Bleaching Clay Industry Trends & Opportunities - Grand View Research
Bleaching clay plays an important role in refining, bleaching, and decolorizing edible oil. It is also used for removal of phospholipids, sulfuric acid, sludge, sulfonic acid, free fatty acids, and traces of metal in oils. Besides these applications, it is used in effluent treatment plants and as an ingredient in cosmetic products.

## Bleaching Clay - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
The term "bleaching clay" or "bleaching earth," as used in the oil industries, refers to clays that in their natural state, or after chemical or physical activation, have the capacity for adsorbing coloring matter from oil. There are three common types of bleaching clays: fuller's earth, activated clays, and activated bauxite.

The process to remove color is considered a bleaching clay, but that is just a term used.

## Paper Pulp Bleaching Process | Pulp Bleaching Equipment - CNBM
In practice, there are two separate "bleaching" process steps: oxygen delignification and final bleaching. To measure the lignin content in pulp, a number called the "Kappa number" is used. The Kappa number is directly proportional to the lignin content of the pulp. Pulp from the digester has a Kappa number of 20-35 for softwood and 15

## Sugarcane Bagasse Pulp Making Process | Bagasse Paper Pulp Machine - CNBM
The basic configuration of the pulp bleaching section is: washing and concentration equipment, pulp conveying equipment, pulp mixing equipment, bleaching agent and auxiliary agent, bleaching reaction tower, etc. The bagasse pulp is relatively easy to bleach; the CEH three-phase bleaching system is able to bleach the bagasse pulp to 80%ISO.
