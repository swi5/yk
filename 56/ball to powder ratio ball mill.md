## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes,  It may also be useful to separate gases such as hydrogen and store them in powder form. Description. Benchtop ball mill.  The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars (ratio: 1:−2 or 1:−1

## Ball Powder Ratio Ball Milling From Pakistan
The mechanics of this mill are characterized by the rotational speed of the plate ωp, that of the container relative to the plate ωv, the mass of the charge, the size of the ball, the ball to powder ratio and the radius of the container. A schematic of the planetary ball mill is shown in Fig.2.4. Figure 2.5 shows a laboratory planetary mill
