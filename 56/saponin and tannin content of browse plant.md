Abstract Newbouldia laevis (P.Beauv) is a medicinal plant traditionally used to treat various diseases across African countries. In Nigeria the leaves of the plant are used in the treatment of convulsions, diabetes, and different bacterial infections. In this study, the acute and sub-chronic toxicity profiles of the ethanolic extract of the leaves of N. laevis were evaluated..

## Saponins | The Naturopathic Herbalist
Saponins. Saponins are found in many plants and gained their name because like soap, they form a lather when combined with water. Chemically they are based on a Steroid or Triterpene fat-soluble base joined to a water-soluble sugar molecule, creating a detergent that results in the emulsification of fat-soluble molecules in the digestive tract of the body.

##  Study of Total phenol, Flavonoids, Tannin contents and  - ijapsa
Total tannin content of T. catappa plant extracts was determined by its ability to reduce phosphotungstomolybdic acid in alkaline solution. The results were compared with standard tannic acid and were expressed in terms of mg tannic acid/g. Total tannin content was high in methanol extract of leaf (50.46±1.1mg/g). In stem bark, the total
