## Concrete Grinding [A Complete Guide] - BW Manufacturing: Leaders in 
While diamond grinding is effective at leveling an uneven surface, it is not an efficient method for flattening a non-flat surface. If your concrete area features a crack or damaged section that is creating a protrusion or tripping hazard, the amount of grinding necessary to flatten the area will cost more in equipment and material costs, and likely result in unevenness in other areas as a result.
