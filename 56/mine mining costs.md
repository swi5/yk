## Digging Deeper: Improving financial performance and reducing 
Some mine haul trucks feature $50,000 tires and consume up to 30 gallons of fuel an hour. It could cost over a million dollars a year to operate one of these mine haul trucks. These high costs are also combined with almost continuous use of equipment in mining industry. This combination allows even small improvements yield into major financial performance gains for miners.

## Life of mine and the environment â€” MineFacts
A mining operation also takes up land and changes the landscape. There are several factors that steer how much the impact is from a mining operation, where the most significant factor is how waste is handled. Other factors can be topography, climate, geology and the sensitivity of lakes, watercourses and the water table.
