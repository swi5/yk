## Lost Mines of Southern California: Randsburg Ghost Town
Gold was discovered on the slopes of Rand Mountain in 1895. From this discovery, the town of Randsburg (originally known as Rand Camp) sprang up almost overnight. By 1899, the town had over 3,500 residents. Randsburg boasted a 100-stamp mill and conservative estimates are that $60,000,000 in gold was taken out of the mines in the area during the town's boom years.

## Comstock Gold Mill - Travel Nevada
The mill is a two stamp gold mill, which was used to process gold and silver rich ore by stamping it (or breaking it down) to extract the precious materials. Interestingly enough, though the mill originally came from the town of Marietta, it did in fact process Comstock silver and gold. Funny how things have a way of coming full circle, isn't it?
