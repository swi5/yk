## Minerals: A Solid, Naturally Occurring Inorganic Substance (Part 1)
A mineral is an inorganic solid which is naturally occured. It has a fixed chemical composition and an ordered atomic arrangement. This may seem a bit of a mouthful but if you break it down it becomes simpler. The geological definition of the mineral normally excludes compounds that appear only in living things.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Rock tumbling mineral oilh-first.shop
The rock in question is diatomite, made of countless silica skeletons of microscopic aquatic plants. Diatomite's tiny pores range from a few billionths to a few millionths of a meter wide, creating a soft and fragile mineral that is up to 70 percent empty space -- light enough to float on water but so nearly impermeable that no one is quite sure how the oil got into the rock in the first place.
