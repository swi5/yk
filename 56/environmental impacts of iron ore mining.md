## environmental impact of mining iron ore
By contrast, iron mining is less wasteful, with approximately 60 percent of the ore extracted processed as waste Da Rosa, 1997; Sampat, 2003. Disposing of such large quantities of waste poses tremendous challenges for the mining industry and may significantly impact the environment.

## Environmental Impacts of Metal Ore Mining and Processing: A Review - ACSESS
The impact of mining and smelting of metal ores on environmental quality is described. Mines produce large amounts of waste because the ore is only a small fraction of the total volume of the mined material. In the metal industry, production of Cu, Pb, and Zn causes the greatest degradation of the environment.
