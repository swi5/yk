## Write a Portfolio on Coal and Petroleum conservation
Anthracite is a hard, black, shiny form of coal that contains virtually no moisture and very low volatile content. Because of this, it burns with little or no smoke and is sold as a smokeless fuel. It is the highest rank of coal. Major components are carbon. Minor components are ash, hydrogen, sulphur, oxygen and nitrogen.

Dart Gun. Wind Mill. Bowling Ball. Work, Energy and Power: Work, energy and power are the three quantities which are inter-related to each other. The rate of doing work is called power. An equal amount of energy is consumed to do a work. So, basically the power is the rate at which energy is consumed to complete a work. Work.

Potential energy is stored energy and the energy of position. Chemical energy is energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules. Batteries, biomass, petroleum, natural gas, and coal are examples of chemical energy. Chemical energy is converted to thermal energy when people burn wood in a fireplace or burn gasoline in a car's engine.

It was during the 1840's that a physicist named James Prescott Jules outlined the theory of conservation of energy. This theory essentially stated that: energy cannot be created or destroyed, but only changed from one form into another or transferred from one object to another. So, when you kick a ball, the potential energy in the ball is

By the time the energy associated with electric power reaches the user, it has taken many forms. Initially, the process begins with the creation of the electricity through some method. For example, the burning of coal in a power plant takes the chemical energy stored in the coal and releases it through combustion, creating heat that produces steam.

The concept and practice of conservation of energy aligns with the aim of achieving sustainability; both in the environment and the economy.This means that energy conservation is one of the measures which must be taken in order to achieve sustainable development.. In other words, conservation of energy refers to the act of reducing the rate of consumption of energy.
