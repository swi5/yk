## Metals and Minerals - Mines and Mills Projects, Plants and Units 
Mining. The Mining sector covers the extraction and processing of metals and mineral ores and deposits, including coal, copper, iron, limestone, nickel, precious metals, potash, uranium, diamonds, minerals, rare earth elements, and much more. The Mining Platform identifies mine type (above-ground, underground and solution) and mining method.

## Making steel | ArcelorMittal
Making steel. Steel is made from iron ore, a compound of iron, oxygen and other minerals that occurs in nature. The raw materials for steelmaking are mined and then transformed into steel using two different processes: the blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace route, and the electric arc furnace route. Both processes are being continually improved
