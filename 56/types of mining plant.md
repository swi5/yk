## The Main Types of Mining and their Differences
Jun 15, 2022The main difference between surface mining today and mining carried out in ancient times is the types of equipment used. As some minerals exist at the surface or just below ground, surface mining is still the most appropriate method for extracting them. Surface mining is also referred to as open-pit mining.

Jan 25, 2021There are two main stages in this type of mining, which are development mining and production mining. Development mining is the initial phase of removing the non-valuable components such as rock to access the targeted minerals. Production mining is the process of excavating the targeted ore after removing the unwanted materials.
