## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

## The Concrete Recycling Process | TRP Ready Mix
To recycle concrete, the concrete must first be broken and removed from the existing pavement—i.e., the demolition of concrete foundations, driveways, sidewalks, and other concrete structures. Concrete recyclers will then haul concrete from a demolition site to a concrete recycling plant. Concrete recyclers can also use a portable crusher at

## What to do with "concrete waste" at any type of concrete plant.
Your best solution for excess concrete materials at any concrete plant starts with simply addressing the issue, and developing a plan. Without a plan, your pile of "concrete waste" will likely continue to grow. With a well thought-out plan, you'll find operational, compliance, and financial benefits you likely aren't receiving now.
