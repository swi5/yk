The iron-ore pellets are produced by a process in which the iron ore is mixed with additives necessary to achieve the desired chemical composition, and then pelletized on rotary discs; the resulting elements are formed pellets that are carried into a straight grate furnace, where they undergo a burning process, with addition of a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons in low percentages, such as

## Effect of Preheating Iron Ore Pellets
However, several processes employ, or can employ, unfired iron ore pellets directly as feed to the metallizing reactor. In these procedures induration is effected during metallization by the sintering of metallic iron grains. The final product is a strong, porous, metallized pellet which is essentially free of cracks.
