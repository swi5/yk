## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. T

1. Ball mill. a Ball mill has a wide range of applications. It can grind metal ore and non-metal ores, which is suitable for hard materials, such as quartz, gold ore, copper ore, iron ore, potash feldspar, etc. b Ball mill is also can be applied in the industries such as cement, construction materials, fireproofing materials, glass, and ceramics.
