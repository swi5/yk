Natural sand and gravel is usually dug or dredged from a pit, bank, river, lake or seabed.In most cases, minimal processing is needed beyond washing and screening the material to separate it by particle size. While they share common uses and applications, crushed stone and sand and gravel differ in their physical properties and production.

The process to make quality concrete sand starts with our pit. We start with a quality natural raw material in the ground. Some concrete sand producers have to add a crushed rock bi-product, also referred to as "man sand", to mix with their natural sand because their natural sand is too fine to get the coarseness required in the finished product.

The consumption figure for construction sand alone is 4.8 bn t. This has become scarce in China. For years, the market prices of river sand, e.g. from the Yangtze, were largely stable at about 40 yuan/t (US$ 5.7/t). In the meantime, these prices have risen to 130 yuan/t, which corresponds to a price increase of 325 %.
