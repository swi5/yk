## Mechanical Separation Processes | SpringerLink
Abstract. Processes which depend primarily on physical forces to accomplish the desired separation of components are used quite commonly in most phases of the food industry. These processes are normally referred to as mechanical separations and include filtration, sedimentation, and centrifugation. Each of these processes involves the

## cyclonic separation in cement industry
Cyclone Separator . Overview. Cyclonic separation is a widely used separation technique in the process, oil and gas, and cement industries. The mechanism of separation occurring within the cyclone is known as classification, whereby fine and coarse, as well as lighter and heavier particles, are separated according to their terminal velocity in the fluid.

In this context, mechanical separation-oriented characterization of electronic scrap was conducted in an attempt to evaluate the amenability of mechanical separation processes. Liberation degrees of various metals from the non-metals, which are crucial for mechanical separation, were analyzed by means of a grain counting approach.
