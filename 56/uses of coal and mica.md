## Use of Coal, Kentucky Geological Survey, University of Kentucky
Uses of Coal. At one time, coal was predominantly used to heat homes and power railroad locomotives and factories. Today, however, coal serves different purposes for society. The chief use of coal is now electricity generation. More than 90 percent of the coal mined in the United States is used for electric power.

## Metallurgical coal
Metallurgical coal or coking coal is a grade of coal that can be used to produce good-quality coke.Coke is an essential fuel and reactant in the blast furnace process for primary steelmaking. The demand for metallurgical coal is highly coupled to the demand for steel. Primary steelmaking companies often have a division that produces coal for coking, to ensure a stable and low-cost supply

Feldspar is used both in the body of the ware and the glaze of ceramics. Mica - Mica mining began on a large scale in western North Carolina about 1868. The area has become the most important producer of mica in the U.S. Sheet mica was the principal product for many years, but other materials have eliminated many of the uses for sheet mica.

Mica. Mica is a mineral name given to a group of minerals that are physically and chemically similar. They are all silicate minerals, known as sheet silicates because they form in distinct layers. Micas are fairly light and relatively soft, and the sheets and flakes of mica are flexible. Mica is heat-resistant and does not conduct electricity.
