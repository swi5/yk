## Thread Rolling & Grinding - Horst Engineering
Thread rolling is a cold forging (or forming) process where hardened steel dies are matched and set to penetrate with force in order to reshape the surface of a round diameter into a thread form. Our extensive "How It Works" note, explains the thread rolling process, it's advantages, and how we help customers engineer their parts to

## Thread Rolling: What Is It? How Does It Work? Process, Types
Thread milling can generate both internal and external threads. Grinding: Instead of cutting the stock, this process uses abrasive tools to remove metal. This is usually done in conjunction with other threading processes. Thread grinding is done to produce precision threads and threads with a good finish.

Any class of fit or thread form can be manufactured by the thread milling process. Thread Grinding Grinding a screw thread generally is done when the hardness of the material makes cutting a thread with a die or single point tool impractical. Grinding threads also results in greater accuracy and in superior surface finishes compared to what can
