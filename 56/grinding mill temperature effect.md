Re: Low temperature cement grinding. Hi Gio, Hope this is same Gio I met Natal SA. Normally when clinker grinding in verucal mills, the mill outlet temperature is around 80-85 deg C only. What I feel is try to optimise the dam ring height of the mill to have proper partical size distribution. This will help to increase the strength.

## Effect Of Temperature During Cement Grinding
Jan 07, 2015 The heating of the mill feed during dry grinding of cement raw mix has no detrimental effects. Also at these temperature the chemical properties of the clinker remain unchanged. However, admixtures such as raw gypsum added to the clinker during grinding are sensitive to these temperatures.

Some manufacturers grind nibs for 72-96 hours, depending on the recipe. When they start the process, they use temperature to warm up the machine but once the process has been started the grinding of the nibs creates its own heat through friction. It will maintain its own temperature at around °F.

If the temperature of grinding cement is too high, you can use a cement cooler to reduce it. Cold water with temperature of 15 ° C can reduce the cement temperature from 110 ℃ to 65 ℃. You can make sprinkler measures in the grinding body, generally in fine grinding compartment spray. 1% to 2% of the cement production is atomized water
