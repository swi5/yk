## How Is Gold Formed? Origins and Process - ThoughtCo
Gold sank to the Earth's core during the planet's formation. It's only accessible today because of asteroid bombardment. Theoretically, it's possible to form gold by the nuclear processes of fusion, fission, and radioactive decay. It's easiest for scientists to transmute gold by bombarding the heavier element mercury and producing gold via decay.

Gold is generally extracted in open-pit mines at 1 to 2 ppm (parts per million) but in certain cases, 0.75 ppm gold is economical. This was achieved by bulk heap leaching at the Peak Hill mine in western New South Wales, near Dubbo, Australia. Nickel, generally as laterite, is extracted via open-pit down to 0.2%.

Panning. Gold panning is mainly a manual gold separation technique from other materials. Large, shallow pans are filled with gold-containing sand and gravel. The pan is submerged and shaken in water, sorting the gravel gold and other material. It quickly settles down to the bottom of the pan as gold is much denser than rock.

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
Removing the gold-bearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.
