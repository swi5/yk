Screen Mesh: $450usd. The SLG-78 can be fitted with multiple mesh sizes staring as small as 1/8 inch all the way up to 4 inches. The ability to fit the SLG-78VF with multiple mesh sizes allows screening for sand, topsoil, compost, gravel rock and wood waste. Changing the mesh to an alternate size will take under 10 minutes.

Step 2: Screen Scrounging & Screen Frame Construction. A friend put me on to a construction/quarry outfit that had bits and pieces of commercial screening that were discarded and lying around the property. I got two pieces for free. One piece has a mesh size of about 1 inch and the other about 3/4 inch.
