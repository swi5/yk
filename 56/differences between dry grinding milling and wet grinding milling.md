## difference between dry grind and wet grinding
The most obvious difference is the use of water while grinding and the non-use of water, that is where the wet and dry name comes from. The wet concrete grinding process. The concrete wet process uses water, which is relatively accessible. The water cools the diamond tooling by acting as a lubricant to reduce friction. Read More

## Wet Milling - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
There have been attempts of semi-dry milling, which requires soaking in water for 0.5-1 h, removal of water, then grinding and drying, and results in no water waste and saving in operational costs compared to wet-milling (Park et al., 2014) while producing better quality products (Chen et al., 1999).

The ore charge in the tests shown in table 18 would probably be small because the mill, which was 19 inches in diameter, had an 8-inch discharge. Wet grinding gave 39 percent, more capacity and 26 percent more efficiency than dry grinding. These values supplement those shown in table 16.

Milling is a unit operation that transforms solid particles into smaller ones by applying forces such as shear, compression, friction, collision or impact. Milling processes can be used for making flour or for extracting gluten and starch (wet milling) from grains and cereals. In the food industry, raw materials, flours and intermediate. .

Nov 13, 2020The wet ball mill has the following features: strong adaptability to materials, continuous production, large crushing ratio, easily fineness adjustment, high grinding efficiency, and low requirements for ore moisture content. In addition, the material transportation device is simple, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than dry ball mills.

The terms milling, size reduction, comminution, grinding and pulverization are often used interchangeably. Milling is a unit operation where mechanical energy is applied to physically break down coarse particles to finer ones and hence, is regarded as a "top-down" approach in the production of fine particles [13].
