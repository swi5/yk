These are the fundamental tools that crush or grind materials. They rotate at a high speed that may vary from 2,500 to 60,000 rpm. A section of the hammer mill In most cases, these hammers are mounted on horizontal shafts where, they may rotate either clockwise or anti-clockwise. This may depend on the direction of the rotor rotation.
