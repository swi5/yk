## What is monazite? Why are the rare earths it contains, useful?
When in high enough concentrations, the grains are mined for their rare earth content. Monazite, together with the zircon, rutile and ilmenite that we have talked about recently, is concentrated in the Fingerboards deposit. Rare earth elements are a group of 17 metals made up of 15 lanthanides, plus scandium and yttrium.

## Mining Indonesia | Introduction and Overview
Mining in Indonesia includes a part or all stages of coal and mineral exploration and exploitation. Minerals are defined by law number 4 of 2009 on Mineral and Coal Mining ("Mining Law") as inorganic compounds which possess specific characteristics and compositions in the form of ores. Coal is defined as sediment of organic carbon which is naturally formed from plants.

I've made a separate column "projectet yield", and started recording the amount collected at different stages. For the biggest sequence (rows 17-38) the sum of all mineral percentages is 631.61, so with multiplier 0.52 the expected yield would be 328.44, but I usually collect between 295 and 300 ton on that run.
