## Low temperature production of wollastonite from limestone and silica 
Wollastonite was produced using solid-state reaction from limestone and silica sand. Limestone containing a high percentage of CaO (55.10%) and silica sand with 99% SiO 2 were used as starting materials. The ratios of limestone/sand used were 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 with various firing temperatures, namely 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400 and 1450 °C.The raw materials and fired products were characterised for

Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium
