## Proposed beneficiation of low-grade iron ore evokes mixed reaction from 
Aug 25, 2022India. SHARE. The government's push for beneficiation of 80 percent of low-grade iron ore has evoked mixed responses with some miners saying the move will make iron ore mining an unviable business while others say it will incentivize the sector. The beneficiation process improves the industrial value of low-grade iron ore.

## Beneficiation of Low Grade Iron Ore: Beneficial to whom?
Nearly 17 per cent of total iron ore produced in India is of low grade. In India, steel mills are known to use premium iron-ore grade of 62 per cent and above; while ores of lower grade, i.e. FE content 58 and below, are preferred for exports. The committee has recommended penalty for failure to adhere to the mandate too.

Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore. The beneficiation process should be as efficient and simple as possible, such as the development
