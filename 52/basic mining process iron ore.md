## Copperbookdate
Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon content (less than 0.08%) in contrast to that of cast iron (2.1% to 4%). It is a semi-fused mass of iron with fibrous slag inclusions (up to 2% by weight), which gives it a "grain" resembling wood that is visible when it is etched, rusted, or bent to the point of failure..

Rocks with large concentrations of minerals, are called ores. Mining depends on finding good quality ore, preferably within a small area. The next step is to get the rocks which contain the mineral out of the ground. Once the ore is on the surface, the process of getting the mineral you want out of the rock can start.
