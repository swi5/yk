## Oil shale power station to generate 15% of Jordan's electricity needs 
AMMAN — An oil shale power station affiliated with the Attarat Power Company (APCO) is expected to be connected to the national electricity grid by May of next year at a capacity of 470MW, covering 15 per cent of Jordan's electricity needs.According to APCO experts, producing the aforementioned amount of electricity will require the combustion of 10 million tonnes of oil shale annually

## Shale gas | Energy & Mining
Shale has such low matrix permeability that it releases gas very slowly and this is why shale is the last major source of natural gas to be developed. However the upside is that shales can store an enormous amount of natural gas.

## 12. The Heart of the Shale Oil Industry
The shale oil industry changed in 1918 when all of the shale oil companies merged into Scottish Oils Ltd, which was later owned by BP. This resulted in the work becoming more centralised and Pumpherston became the refinery for all of the oil works. Cracking plants were constructed in the refinery c.1929, greatly increasing the output of petrol.

## Pollutional Problems and Research Needs for an Oil Shale Industry
The stabilization of spent shale residues is the major environmental problem confronting the developing oil shale industry and EPA. Recla- mation of the disposal site is second in priority to effective stabilization. 2. Freeze-thaw conditions and water saturation can result in the mass movement of spent shale through slumping and sliding.

## Oil Shale | National Geographic Society
Oil shale is a type of sedimentary rock that is rich in kerogen. Kerogen is a part of rock that breaks down and releases hydrocarbons when heated. Hydrocarbons are substances made entirely of hydrogen and carbon. Petroleum and natural gas are probably the most familiar hydrocarbons.The hydrocarbons in oil shale can be used as an alternative to petroleum or natural gas.
