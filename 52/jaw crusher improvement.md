For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

Jaw Crushers are sized by the top opening of the crushing chamber. For example, a 32 x 54 Jaw Crusher measures 32" from jaw die to jaw die at the top opening or gape opening and 54" across the width of the two jaw dies. The narrower bottom opening of the crushing chamber is used to size the discharge material.

As excessive wear can cause a 10-20% reduction in production, it is important to find the optimal time for the jaw turn or change in terms of cost and benefit. Again, with the same scenario with C130, we would have approximately a 70 stph reduction in production, in other words, a decrease of USD 4000 to 8000 in revenue for one day.
