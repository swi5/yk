## Graphene News and Updates
RUDN researchers have created and tested a method for processing titanium dental implants. It turned out that theanoslos of graphene on the surface of titanium improve its interaction with stem cells,which are placed on the implant so that it better "takes root".Thanks to this method ofprocessing, stem cells are better kept on the surface, multiply and turn into the desired cells.

Safety and Hazards Dangers to miners. Coal mining is dangerous activity and the list of mining disasters is a long one. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners were killed in accidents in the twentieth century, 90 percent of the fatalities occurring in the first half of the century. More than 3,200 died in 1907 alone. Open cut hazards are principally mine wall failures and vehicle

## Methods Of Coal Mining
Coal Mining And Transportation Us Energy. Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits called coal beds or seams are near the earths surface while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nations coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.

Four main methods of mining are available: underground, open surface (pit), placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and often used to reach deposits that are deeper. Surface mines are usually used for deposits that are shallower and less valuable. Placer mining is used in river channels, beach sands, or other

Nancy Irwin Maxwell, in Encyclopedia of Energy, 2004. 1.1 Environmental Impacts of Underground and Surface Mining of Coal. Coal mining traditionally took place underground, with men and equipment following seams of coal deep within mountains. Since the 1960s, surface mining methods have become more common, and today they account for more than half of the coal produced in the United States.

Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.

The underground mining methods we use include room and pillar, narrow vein stoping and large-scale mechanised mining. Room and pillar mining is a style of mining where tunnels are driven in a chess board pattern with massive square pillars between them which are gradually cut away as the work proceeds. We use this for mining coal.
