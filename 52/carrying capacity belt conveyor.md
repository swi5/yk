A belt conveyor is comprised of a rectangular bed, flanked by two pulleys that are powered by motors. A large belt is wrapped around the bed and pulleys, subsequently rotating around the bed and pulleys, creating movement in one direction. Belt conveyors can be customized to practically any length, or even built on an incline to move items up.
