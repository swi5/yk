## Why do we need beneficiation? Explained by FAQ Blog
Beneficiation is the process where ore is reduced in size and gange separated from the ore. Since all iron ore deposits have unique mineralogy, the beneficiation process is specific to each deposit.  Cement is manufactured through a closely controlled chemical combination of calcium, silicon, aluminum, iron and other ingredients.

Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging Sep 25, 2018For the beneficiation of the iron ore, use of airpulsed jigs is more popular. This is because airpulsed jigs are capable of generating the large pulse amplitudes required to fluidize a deep bed of the heavy ore, particularly the lump iron ore.

## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

This depends on the grade of the ores: gold grades are around 1 g gold/tonne of ore, copper ore contain around 1% metal, while iron ore with a grade of around 60%. The production of ores containing PGMs is however much smaller, only 100 Mt. Most ores are produced in open pit operations, as much as 85% varying from metal to metal.
