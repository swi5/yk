## Is concrete hazardous waste? Is concrete a hazardous material?
NO. Concrete is a building material, and if used for its originally intended purpose, it is not a waste material at all. Since it is not a waste first and foremost, it cannot be a hazardous waste by definition. So the question of is concrete hazardous waste is clearly no. However, can concrete be considered hazardous?
