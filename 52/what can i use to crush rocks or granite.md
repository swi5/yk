Decomposed granite, or DG for short, is a finely weathered and eroded form of granite—a hard rock rich in minerals like quartz, mica, and feldspar. Most DG that you'll find in stores is composed of particles as large as three-eighths of an inch to as fine as dust. DG is mined in quarries from many different regions of Northern America

Use the mallet only to gently set the stones into the crushed granite. The mallet can only do minor adjustments, as far as leveling flagstones is concerned. Fill the joints with stone dust/aka screenings, decomposed granite, ect-the same stuff you should use to level the stones out with.
