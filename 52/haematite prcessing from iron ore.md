## Is the best variety of iron ore? Explained by FAQ Blog
What are the main varities of iron ore? Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone.These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red.

## Which elements are joined with iron in haematite?
Known reserves include the Tung-Yeh-Chen hematite deposit and the Dongye hematite deposit. One of the major advantages hematite ore has over other types like magnetite is its high iron content. That makes the iron extraction process much less costly and time consuming.

## How Is Iron Ore Extracted - Realonomics
How Is Iron Ore Extracted? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

## Processing of Banded Hematite Quartzite Ore for Recovery of Iron Values 
This study investigates upgrading of low-grade banded hematite quartzite iron ore (Fe ~31%). Conventional beneficiation was found to be futile. The susceptibility of iron phases to microwave exposure and their selective absorption assists in the liberation of iron values. Microwave exposure of coarse particles at 540 W for 10 min yielded a concentrate with Fe 56.30% and recovery of 50.68%

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
