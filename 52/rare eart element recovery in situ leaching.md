## Acid Leaching of Rare Earth Elements from Coal and Coal Ash 
High-temperature pretreatment of coal-based mineral matter in an oxidizing environment significantly enhances the leaching characteristics of rare earth elements (REEs). A research study has found that the temperatures used in fluidized bed combustion (FBC) of coal to produce electricity are near optimum for pretreating the associated mineral matter prior to leaching to maximize the recovery

Results showed that in-situ leaching mining considerably impacted microbial communities of the mining soils. The abundances of bacterial, archaeal, and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were significantly and negatively correlated with ionic rare earth elements (REEs), while their diversities were relatively stable.

This imposes limitations on future usage of CdS-sensitized TiO2 photo-catalytic systems in water purification processes. In an effort to solve out the leaching difficulties, and to make catalyst recovery easier, the TiO2/CdS system has been supported onto insoluble silica particles giving Silica/TiO2/CdS systems for the first time.

## Special Issue "Leaching of Rare Earth Elements from Various Sources" - MDPI
To improve the recovery of rare earth elements (REEs) from a refractory ore, this study investigated two different chemical decomposition methods, namely sulfuric acid baking and caustic digestion, with their respective leaching processes.  The in situ leaching profile analysis showed that the kaolinite content increased initially and then
