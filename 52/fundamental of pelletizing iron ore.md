## Effects of bentonite fiber formation in iron ore pelletization
Iron ore pelletization plants in the United States used approximately 612,000 metric tons of bentonite as a binder to produce iron ore concentrate pellets in 2000 (Virta, 2001). It is a major cost item, with individual plants spending US$3-5 million annually for bentonite.  Pelletizing of Iron Ores, Springer, Berlin (1980) 302 pp. Google
