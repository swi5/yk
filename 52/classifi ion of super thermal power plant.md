Thermal Power Plant: Thermal Power Plant Classification. Thermal power plants are classified by the type of fuel and the type of prime mover installed.. By fuel. Nuclear power plants use a nuclear reactor 's heat to operate a steam turbine generator. About 20% of electric generation in the USA is produced by nuclear power plants.

## Definition, Principles & Components - Nuclear Power Plant
A nuclear power plant is a thermal power plant, in which a nuclear reactor is used to generate large amounts of heat. This heat is used to generate steam (directly or via steam generator) which drives a steam turbine connected to a generator that produces electricity. The steam turbine is a common feature of all thermal power plants.

## Classification Of Super Thermal Power Plant
For a thermal power plant the range of pressure may vary from 10 kg/cm2 to super critical pressures and the range of temperature may be from 250 C to 650 C. 3.1.1 Essentials of Steam Power Plant Equipment: A steam power plant must have following equipment: (a) A furnace to burn the fuel.

## Classification of OTEC Power Plants - Engineering Notes India
OTEC power plants may be classified on the basis of- (i) Location and (ii) Cycle. Classification of OTEC Power Plants Depending Upon Location: i. Land-Based Power Plant:  (Ocean Thermal Corporation 1984). This type of plant would use shorter (and therefore less costly) intake and discharge pipes, which would avoid the dangers of turbulent
