## Quartz
Quartz is a hard, crystalline mineral composed of silica (silicon dioxide).The atoms are linked in a continuous framework of SiO 4 silicon-oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall chemical formula of SiO 2.Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in Earth's continental crust, behind feldspar.. Quartz exists in two forms, the normal α-quartz

## Quartz Mineral | Photos, Uses, Properties, Pictures - Geology
Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.
