Leaching of Alumina from bauxite. Leaching of alumina is done by the Bayer's process. The principal ore of aluminium, bauxite, usually contains SiO 2, iron oxides and titanium oxide (TiO 2) as impurities. Concentration is carried out by digesting the powdered ore with a concentrated solution of NaOH at 473 - 523 K and 35 - 36 bar pressure.

Bauxite is the main ore of aluminium with silica (SiO 2), ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3) and titanium oxide (TiO 2) as impurities in it.; In this process, the bauxite ore is first crushed and then it is leached by heating with hot concentrated caustic soda (NaOH) solution under high pressure for 2 to 8 hrs at 140 to 150 °C in a tank called a digester.

Answer and Explanation: Baeyer's process is used to obtain pure alumina. Bauxite ore usually contains impurities of iron xide, silica and titanium oxide . The powdered ore is heated with a concentrated solution of at K. The alumina dissolves forming sodium meta aluminate and silica as sodium silicate, leaving behind the impurities.

This occurrence is effectuated by the limited adsorbent sites at constant bauxite concentration for many fluoride ions at increased adsorbate concentration.  producing AA filter media (USD 1800/tonne) costs around 60 times more than raw bauxite ore (USD 30/tonne) [26,27,28], and the composite ore deposit abundance in fluoride-contaminated

## bauxite | ore | Britannica
bauxite, rock largely composed of a mixture of hydrous aluminum oxides. Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum. Bauxites vary physically according to the origin and geologic history of their deposits: some deposits are soft, easily crushed, and structureless; some are hard, dense, and pisolitic, or pealike; still others are porous but strong or are stratified or largely pseudomorphic after
