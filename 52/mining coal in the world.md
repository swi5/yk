##  Managing Coal Mine Closure - World Bank
3 The narrow economic base of many coal mining regions requires careful mitiga-tion of coal mine closure impacts. Coal mining is often concentrated in regions far from major population and economic centers where alternative employment pros-pects may be found .

## coal mining | Definition, History, Types, & Facts | Britannica
coal mining, extraction of coal deposits from the surface of Earth and from underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. Its predominant use has always been for producing heat energy. It was the basic energy source that fueled the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the industrial growth of that era in turn supported the large-scale exploitation of coal
