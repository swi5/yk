Quarries and stone manufacturers use diamond-wire cutters for precise and clean cutting of stone slabs. The wire is extremely long and runs from a motorized spool, attached to a vehicle on a track. The process is similar to that of someone slicing through a piece of cheese. However, the harder the stone, the more difficult it will be to make a cut.

In the granite quarries in Assuan the stone working was done as follows: Granite grows in layers or sheets (beds). Quarrying takes a keen eye to determine the grain of the rock. The foreman (or rockman) chooses the place where the rock is intact. Then the stone is cleaved from the rock face by driving in wedges.

Extraction cutting allows quarry miners to gain access to large granite block of unshaped stone. Typically miners use large saws, often called gang saws, to cut into a deposit of earthbound stone. When it is in its natural, uncut, unextracted state, quarry stone is far softer and easier to cut through than finished chiseled and polished stone.
