Roll Crushers. Roll Crushers are compression type crushers, and were once widely used in mining. They have, within the last 10 or so years, fallen into dis-favor among mining and processing companies. The probable reason is because the large mines require very large crushed product output with minimal cost, makes the roll crusher uncompetitive.
