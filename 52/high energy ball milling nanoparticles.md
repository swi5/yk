## High Energy Ball Mill - Nanografi Nano Technology
High Energy Ball Mill Ball Mill is a grinder that blends or grinds materials for various applications. Impact force enables size reduction in feed material. The cylindrical shell rotates around its horizontal axis. The main element enabling grinding is the hard and small balls in the ball mill. These balls are usually made of steel.
