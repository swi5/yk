Isky had a grind in the 1974 catalog for Chryslers called the B-777. It was a sol lifter FT grind. I used it a few times in the 70s/80s. Was so impressed with it, I had a local cam grinder make a copy. As with many sol lifter cams, adv duration was at 0.020" lifter rise. It had 268 @ 0.020", & 240 @ 050.

Cons of Unlimited Separation. Emotional: One the obvious drawbacks to an unlimited separation is that you're not allowed to get married until a divorce is initiated and finalized. While you certainly can date and explore new relationships while separated, those relationships can only go so far if you are still legally bound to your spouse.

In general, the beneficiation of plastics with similar densities was not effective, since the separation efficiency was lower than 25%. However, in bi-component plastic mixtures that join a low density plastic (PS) with a high density one (PMMA, PET-S, PET-D, PVC-M and PVC-D), the quality of the jigging separation was greatly improved.

The separation density can be adjusted with pressure, apex size and vortex finder length.  The main advantage of DMS compared to its main gravitational opponent, jigging, is its higher separation efficiency, especially when excessive near-density material causes jigging to become ineffective.

## Gold Jig & Mineral Processing Jigs
Ragging variables affecting the separation character of the jig bed are density and size. The ragging should have a density between the gold and the jig's tailings and sized so as to pulse and produce open spaces for the gold to move thru it. Ragging dimensions can range from 5 mm to 20 mm and need not be so small and cause blinding of screen
