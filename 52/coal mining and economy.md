Oct 19, 2021But it's not the economic powerhouse it once was. Coal mining employed around 13,000 people in West Virginia as of 2019 - about 3% of the state's workforce - down from 120,000 in 1950

It found that the coal industry directly employs 49,300 people, indirectly employs almost 130,000 people and its economic contribution is valued at $43 billion, a growth of 20% over six years. While seemingly impressive, the figures lose their shine under examination.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## How does coal mining contribute to the economy? - Origin of coal
The coal mining industry contributed approximately R37 billion to the economy in 1993, with gold contributing R115 billion (value added at constant 2010 prices). In 2013, coal contributed R51 billion to South Africa's economy, compared with gold's R31 billion 1 . . 28% of South African coal production is exported.

Global coal mine production is expected to increase by a marginal 0.9% to 8,126Mt in 2022, with output from India, Communist China and South Africa crucial to this increase. Collective production from these countries is expected to expand from 5.1 billion tonnes (Bnt) in 2021 to 5.5Bnt in 2022 - a 7.8% rise.

coal mining, extraction of coal deposits from the surface of Earth and from underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. Its predominant use has always been for producing heat energy. It was the basic energy source that fueled the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the industrial growth of that era in turn supported the large-scale exploitation of coal

This paper examines economic impacts of coal mining across local government areas (LGAs) in Australia. Three main distinguishing features of this research are a) the analysis through the mining boom and bust cycle, b) a focus on small regional areas within one state in Australia and c) the use of socio-economic indicators in addition to the standard income and employment indicators.
