## Electrowinning
Electrowinning, also called electroextraction, is the electrodeposition of metals from their ores that have been put in solution or liquefied. Electrorefining uses a similar process to remove impurities from a metal. Both processes use electroplating on a large scale and are important techniques for the economical and straightforward purification of non-ferrous metals.

I am not sure if whether the prepared solution would dissolve the cathode. If it would, I dont think it would at a fast rate as the gold. In that regard, try to immerse your cathode in the prepared solution starting with 30 sec and introduce it to high pressured water and check if it can work. if it does'nt, immerse for another 30 sec, then check.

## The first question is how far-selbsthilfegruppe
Production of cobalt metal and copper cathode increased by a total of 45% due to [] price ratio of the recovered metal and nickel. What does the Fastmarkets reference price assess?  A hundred years ago, gold sold for just $20 per ounce. In recent years gold has traded between $1,200 and $1,900 per ounce. That's a huge move up in nominal

## The direct electrowinning of gold from dilute cyanide leach liquors
Abstract. A cylindrical electrowinning cell employing a three-dimensional steel wool cathode has been used to investigate the effect of free cyanide concentration, pH, solution conductivity and base metal impurities on the electrowinning of gold from alkaline cyanide leach liquors containing up to 5 mg/l gold. The recovery of gold in a given

## China Electrowinning/Electrorefining Stainless Steel Cathode Plate 
Sanyou Technology has the largest cathode plate manufacturing plant and refurbishment centre in China, with the maximum capacity of 160,000 sets of new cathode plates per year and 50,000 sets of refurbished cathodes per year. 2 types of permanent cathode plate could be manufactured and supplied according to detail application demands: "stainless encapsulated by copper" has better conductivity
