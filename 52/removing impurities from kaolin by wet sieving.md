## CNA - Technique for efficiently removing iron from kaolin 
The invention relates to a technique for efficiently removing iron from kaolin by magnetic separation, which is characterized by comprising the following steps: (1) purifying kaolin raw ore to obtain a magnetic separation raw material; (2) adding water to the magnetic separation raw material obtained in the step (1) to prepare a mixed slurry with the solid content of 10-20 wt%, adding sodium

##  Removal of mineral impurities from kaolin using flotation
THE EFFECT OF DISCOLORING IMPURITIES The brightness and color of the pigment are influenced to a degree by relatively small quantities of (1) discrete, colored impurities present in the kaolin and (2) iron hydroxide stains on the surface of the particles. Generally, flotation processes remove Ti02 from the kaolin which improves product brightness.

Magnetic separation is the process of using magnetic force to remove metallic or ferrous materials from a mixture. Magnetic separation machines consist of a vibratory feeding mechanism, an upper and lower belt and a magnet. The bulk material is fed through the vibrating mechanism onto the lower belt. At this point, the magnet pulls any material.

The dyed impurities in kaolin (such as hematite, etc.) have weak magnetic properties and can be removed by a high gradient magnetic separator. In the United States, the PEM-84 wet high gradient magnetic separator can reduce Fe2O3 in kaolin ore from 0.9% to 0.6%, and Ti2O3 from 1.8% to 2.0% to 0.8%.
