## specific tenacity basalt fiber
The specific tenacity (rupture stress to density ratio) of basalt fibers exceeds that of steel, many times. Basalt fibers are non-capillary and non-hygroscopic, giving good moisture resistance. Basalt has shot content generally less than 3%[1].

## Basalt Fiber Properties, Advantages and Disadvantages
Basalt is a type of igneous rock formed by the rapid cooling of lava at the surface of a planet. It is the most common rock in the Earth's crust.[1] Basalt rock characteristics vary from the source of lava, cooling rate, and historical exposure to the elements. High quality fibers are made from basalt deposits with uniform chemical makeup.

## What is Basalt Fiber - Basalt Fiber Tech - Main Section
Basalt is a type of igneous rock formed by the rapid cooling of lava at the surface of a planet. It is the most common rock in the Earth's crust. Basalt rock characteristics vary from the source of lava, cooling rate, and historical exposure to the elements. High quality fibers are made from basalt deposits with uniform chemical makeup.
