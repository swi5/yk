Open-pit mining. Some 53% of South Africa's coal is produced from surface mining, via open-cast or open-pit mines. This is because the coal is less than 60 metres below the surface. Open-pit mines use draglines, as well as truck and shovel operations to extract coal. A dragline excavator uses a dragline to pull a bucket by a wire cable.

Jun 4, 2021Coal mining in Africa is still a profitable industry. While many countries move away from fossil fuels, mining production in Africa continues to rise. Much of the continent's coal comes from South Africa, which accounts for roughly 85% of production. In this article, we'll look at some of the main coal mines in Africa and how this industry affects the continent's economy.
