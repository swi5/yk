I would suggest that you size the filter based on the pump. I suggest finding the flow rate of the pump at 20 ft of head, then using the following equation. √ (F x 3.05) = radius of filter in inches. For example if the flow is 60 gpm at 20 feet of head. √ (60 x 3.05) = 13.5 inches radius or about 27 inches diameter.

A turnover rate of 8 or 10 hours is a typical sizing rate for residential pools. All filters have flow requirements. D.E. filters are normally rated at 2 GPM per square feet (sq. ft.) of filter area for maximum flow. This means a 48 sq. ft. D.E. filter will have a maximum flow rate of 96 GPM, and a 60 sq. ft. model will be rated at 120 GPM.

## Choosing the Right Type of Swimming Pool Filter - LiveAbout
Cartridge Filters. This one is easy to understand. Water passes through a filter material and the filter captures the debris. This is just like the water filters used under your sink. Cartridges have much more available area to filter than sand. Most start at 100 square feet, and the majority of the cartridge filters sold are larger than 300

## Sand vs DE Pool Filters - MyWaterEarth&Sky
With DE Filters once the pressure gauge reads 8-10 pounds over the start-up and normal operating pressure then it's time to backwash the D.E. Filter. Sand can filter down to around 30 microns in size so D.E. filters have the advantage of filtering the pool water to the smallest microns and will keep the water cleaner and clearer than any sand

## How to Install a Sand Filter For an Above Ground Pool  - ByRossi
For example, an above-ground pool that has a sand filter pump size of 18′ needs at least a 0.75 horsepower (hp) rated single-speed or dual-speed pump to work properly. However, if you have a large in-ground pool with a larger diameter, it is recommended that you install the most powerful variable-speed system.

## Sand Filters - Purdue University College of Engineering
Sand filters treat wastewater using naturally occurring physical, biological, and chemical processes. They are one of the best options for additional onsite treatment where septic tank/soil absorption systems have failed or are restricted due to high groundwater, shallow bedrock, poor soils, or other site conditions.
