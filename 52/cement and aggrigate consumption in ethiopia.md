How To Calculate Cement Sand Aggregates Quantity In . Aug 03, 2018 CALCULATION FOR AGGREGATE QUANTITY; Consider volume of concrete = 1m 3 . Dry Volume of Concrete = 1 x 1.54 = 1.54 m 3. Aggregate = (3/5.5) x 1.54 = 0.84 m 3 ∴ 3 is a part of cement, 5.5 is sum of ratio. Density of Aggregate is 1500/m 3 Calculation for KG = 0.84 x 1500 = 1260 kg.
