## Heap Leaching - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
2.1 Leaching. Most copper leaching is done by piling broken ore (∼0.5% Cu) into flat-surface, 3-10m high, 10 4 -10 5 m 2 heaps of ore and then sprinkling dilute sulfuric acid lixiviant on to the heap surface. The lixiviant trickles down through the heap and leaches copper from its minerals to produce a pregnant leach solution containing 1-5kg Cum −3.

Copper hydrometallurgy is a branch of metallurgy method to extract copper directly from those difficult-to-concentrate copper oxide ore. Traditional copper hydrometallurgy process typically consists of atmospheric leaching, solvent extraction (SX) and electro-winning (EW). It can produce either copper cathode or copper sulphate crystal
