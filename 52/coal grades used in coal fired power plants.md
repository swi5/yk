## Coal fired power plant - Energy Education
Coal fired power plants also known as coal fired power stations are facilities that burn coal to make steam in order to generate electricity. These stations, seen in Figure 1, provide ~40% of the world's electricity. [2] Countries such as South Africa use coal for 94% of their electricity and China and India use coal for 70-75% of their

## What are the types of coal? | U.S. Geological Survey
Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity.

Coal-fired power plants are the primary sources of coal FAs in the United States. According to the US Energy Information Administration, approximately 24% of the electricity generated in the United States relies on coal-burning (Fig. 23.1).As of 2018, the generation of coal FA in the United States was over 36 million tons, and 20 million tons of it were recycled (ACAA, 2019).

##  Emerging Technologies for Optimizing Efficiency and Minimising GHG 
COAL-FIRED POWER PLANT The level of CO2 emissions that can potentially be released from a coal-fired Power Plant depends on the type content. Hence, the ratio of carbon to heat content depends on these heat-producing components of coal, and these components vary by coal grade. Table 4 presents grades of Indian coal with Elemental analysis.
