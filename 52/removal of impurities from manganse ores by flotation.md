## flotation cell machine for remove impurities of miner
The step of ore processing for the removal of the impurities known as flotation can be done by the flotation column or by the flotation cell. There is a basic principle governing the operation of two models of flotation equipment in mining: separation of the desired product from impurities by agitation or aeration of the water, where the

## Impurity Removal in the Reverse Flotation of Iron Ore
Vale is the largest iron ore producer in the world. Since the 1970s, Vale has been using reverse cationic flotation to remove siliceous impurities from its iron ores. Whilst this flotation process has operated effectively for many years, it suffers from the problems of high reagent costs and high metal loss.In 2010, CSIRO investigated the use

## Concentration of Ore: Definition, Classification, Methods - Embibe
Ores found on the earth contains many impurities like sand, rocks, and grit in them, which are collectively known as "Gangue".The concentration of ore is a method of removing gangue particles or other impurities in order to purify the ore. This process is also called Ore-dressing and benefaction.It is a very crucial step to obtain a pure metal from ore and to extract the metal.

## Purification of ores - Engineersfield
The ore is generally associated with rock impurities like clay, sand etc. called 'gangue or matrix'. The purification of ore means removal of gangue from the powdered ore. This process is otherwise called concentration of the ore or ore dressing. Thus, the percentage of the ore in the concentrated ore is higher than that in the original ore.

With the depleting reserves of high-grade iron ore in the world, froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate- and low-grade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market. In over half a century's practice in the iron ore industry, froth flotation has been established as an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore.

removal rate ofMg and Ca 97.93% and 95.11% respectively, but also guarantees the high manganese recovery of more than 96%. The research indicates that it is feasible to realize the clean produce of high pure manganese sulfate from low-grade manganese ore with a short process, which promotes the
