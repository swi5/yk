Hydraulic mining was a variation on ground sluicing where the water delivered to the site would be shot through a nozzle at high pressure onto the face of the cliff, thereby washing away tons of boulders, gravel, dirt, and gold. The first use of this method is credited to Edward Mattison in 1853. Mattison delivered the water through a rawhide.
