Silica sand is a very fine sand composed of quartz (a white to colorless mineral) and is mined in the southeastern part of Minnesota. It is used to make glass, as a source of silicon, and is used in oil drilling to improve the flow of oil to oil wells. Granite and limestone are used in the construction of homes, buildings, roads and tombstones.

Hydraulic mining was a variation on ground sluicing where the water delivered to the site would be shot through a nozzle at high pressure onto the face of the cliff, thereby washing away tons of boulders, gravel, dirt, and gold. The first use of this method is credited to Edward Mattison in 1853. Mattison delivered the water through a rawhide.
