## Using Crusher Dust in Your Construction Project
By nature of the product, crusher dust is easy to work with, spread, and level out. As the material settles, the dust and smaller pieces fill the gaps between larger pieces of stone, creating a smooth and compact surface. The material is tightly packed, which means there is no shifting, no moving, and no potholes developing over time.
