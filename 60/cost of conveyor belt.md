Sep 30, 2020Belt repairs are much quicker and less costly with a plastic modular link style belt when compared to a one-piece fabric or rubber belt.

## Conveyor Belt: What Is It? How Does It Work? Types, Parts - IQS Directory
A conveyor belt is a material handling system designed to move supplies, materials, and components using an efficient and effortless process that saves on time, energy, and cost. The design of conveyor belts includes two motorized pulleys with the conveyor material looped over them.

## Belt conveyor reduces maintenance and operating costs
Cost-effective use of modular Components. The Bruks belt conveyor, like the Tubulator, uses a modular design. Its 3m sections consisting of carry side pan, return side pan or rollers, covers, air supplies and supporting structures, form the basis of the conveyor. If the conveyor is fixed to the floor or ground, simple support legs are used.

## Conveyor Systems: Total Cost of Ownership
Example: Compare two belt-driven accumulation conveyors. A conventional belt-driven conveyor with a centralized drive costs less than an innovative alternative such as Hytrol's e24 24-volt DC power roller system with its decentralized drive system. But the e24 is less expensive to install, operate, and maintain.
