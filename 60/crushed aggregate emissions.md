Crushed concrete aggregate is used in construction projects such as bridge foundations, soil-cement pavement bases, airport runways, and oil and gas civil construction projects. It is also used for pavements, shoulders, and sidewalks. In addition, it can be used for making structural grade concrete, lean-concrete, and bituminous concrete.
