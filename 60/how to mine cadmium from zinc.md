Total cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) contents in soils around mine spoils ranged from 1.91?80 and 98?9200 mg/kg with an arithmetic mean of 28 and 4079 mg/kg, respectively. These amounts are much higher than the background levels. Higher concentrations of the labile form of Cd (20.7%) and moderate levels for Zn (7.6%) indicate a high environmental threat by these toxic elements.

Cadmium is produced mainly as a by-product of mining, smelting and refining of zinc and, to a lesser degree, as a by-product of lead and copper manufacturing. Most of the cadmium produced is used in the production of nickel-cadmium batteries, which in 2004 represented 81 per cent of the total amount of cadmium.

The original cadmium is a rare soft metal, similar to zinc but much harder to find naturally in the earth. It was only when it was discovered as a by-product of the zinc refining process that it became used a commercial pigment. This discovery took place in 1817, when the German chemist Friedrich Stromeyer was inspecting pharmacies.

## How To Separate Cadmium From Zinc Ore
Selective Separation Of Copper And Cadmium From Zinc. mar 01, 2010 the zinc-cadmium ammonia solution was then filtered. in the same way, the zinc-copper-cadmium ammonia solution was made by dissolving copper sulphate. the concentrations of zinc, copper and cadmium ions in the solutions were 30 55 g/l, 6.0 6.3 g/l and 3.5 7.2 g/l, respectively.
