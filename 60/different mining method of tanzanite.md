Mining Methods. There are four key stages of work involved in mining for minerals. These include: 3415, 3416 Prospecting - The purpose of this stage is to identify areas that are likely to contain mineral deposits. The work includes geological, geochemical and geophysical surveys (e.g. seismic surveying), aerial surveys, including the taking of samples by low-impact mechanical methods.

Shrinkage stoping refers to any overhand method in which the stope is kept full of broken ore until it is completed. The miners stand on top of the broken ore and work at the back. As broken ore takes up more space than ore in a solid mass, about 35 to 40 per cent, of it must be drawn to leave room for working.
