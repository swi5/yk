NIOSH also recommends an exchange rate of 3 dB (A) so that each increase of 3 dB (A) halves the permitted exposure time. Example: OSHA allows eight hours of exposure for noise levels of 90 dB (A), but only two hours of exposure to 100 dB (A). NIOSH recommends limiting eight-hour exposure to below 85 dB (A). For 100 dB (A), NIOSH recommends less

Remove people from the vicinity of noisy work. For example, use a machine mounted breaker on an excavator with a good quality cab and exclude other people from the area while the breaker is in use. Select quiet equipment. For example, compare noise levels from power tools when buying or hiring equipment. Use information from the manufacturer or

## NC - the Noise Criterion - Engineering ToolBox
Noise Criterion - NC - were established in the U.S. to rate indoor noise like noise from air-conditioning equipment and similar. In Europe it is common to use the alternative Noise Rating Curve - NR.. The method is based on a measurement of sound pressure levels and a set of sound pressure criteria curves ranging frequencies from 63 to 8000 Hz - and a tangent rating procedure.

Easy ways to keep noise levels low. Buy the quietest plant and machinery for the job and always ask the manufacturer/supplier for information about noise levels.

Three approaches to noise control should be considered for any noise problem: 1. The noise source may be modified. 2.
