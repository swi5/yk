The three types of crushers most commonly used for crushing CDW materials are the jaw crusher, the impact crusher and the gyratory crusher (Figure 4.4).A jaw crusher consists of two plates, with one oscillating back and forth against the other at a fixed angle (Figure 4.4(a)) and it is the most widely used in primary crushing stages (Behera et al., 2014).

## The Benefits Of An Impact Crusher Portable Plant - Sepro Aggregates
Disadvantages Of An Impact Crusher. Since impact crushers use powerful collision forces to break apart particles, they have higher operational costs due to higher wear rates when compared to cone and jaw crushers. They can also be less efficient as more fine material is created during the crushing process compared to jaw and cone crushers.
