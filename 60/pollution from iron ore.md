## A clearer look at how iron reacts in the environment
ARGONNE, ILL. (Sept. 6, 2012) — Using ultrafast X-rays, scientists for the first time have watched how quickly electrons hop their way through rust nanoparticles. This gives key insight to how iron oxide, one of the most abundant minerals in soil, behaves and alters the condition of soil and water around it. This also demonstrates the potential of time-resolved X-ray and optical methods to

Abstract: Different lung diseases including lung cancer are the major occupational diseases among the workers of iron ore dust. However, health hazards that arise due to exposures to the ore dust vary considerably due to its variable composition in different mines. Iron oxide and silica predominantly contribute to its toxicological properties.
