## Bioretention Ponds - Same-Day Aggregates
About six to ten inches of water can then be drained into the pond and "held" by an aggregate like specialized salt, sand or gravel. Salt, sand and gravel act create a bioretention pond and are essential to the aggregate filtration system design. Aggregates can collect pollutants in stormwater runoff with each rain or drainage event.

Designing Better Retention Ponds. Hydrology is the science of modeling water flow and volume to correctly size storm water features like retention ponds. It's not as simple as picking a total maximum volume and using a calculator to determine the corresponding dimensions for the pond. Pond capacity is based around a 12-hour drain time

## How Do Detention and Retention Ponds Work?
Detention ponds are frequently used in places with at least 10 acres of land to work with. They use a slight slope to help divert water into the drainage system and can hold a lot of water in the basin area. Once the water is in the detention pond, it slowly drains out through the bottom of the structure. Depending on your unique needs, you can

Then, you will need to fold your liner down and pack soil over its top. Your liner should come up to the level of the bricks and then slope away from your new pond. This ensures that runoff, like dirt or debris, will not flow into your pond. Additionally, proper placement will also direct any overflow away from your pond.
