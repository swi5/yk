## Gravel
Gravel is a major basic raw material in construction. Sand is not usually distinguished from gravel in official statistics, but crushed stone is treated as a separate category. In 2020, sand and gravel together made up 23% of all industrial mineral production in the U.S., with a total value of about $12.6 billion.

## What is Aggregate And The Different Types of Aggregates
Natural Aggregate. Using natural rocks (such as limestone, granite, basalt, etc.) mined as raw materials, aggregates made by physical crushing are called natural aggregates, such as sand, crushed stone, gravel, etc. It is an important part of concrete and is widely used in urban road engineering, bridges, buildings and other infrastructure fields.

To break it down, 2 cubic yards of mulch would be 18, 3 cubic foot bags of mulch. So, say it takes 5 minutes to put down each 3 cubic foot bag (5 minutes X 18 = 90 minutes)then it would be right at 90 minutes which is 1 1/2 hours. This wasn't a choice so I picked 2 hours. Explanation: Two people can spread 1 yard of mulch within 15 minutes usually.
