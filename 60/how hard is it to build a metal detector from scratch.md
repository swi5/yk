Impressed with the way the equipment detected the metal, Dr. Fischer worked on designing the first truly portable metal detector, patenting it in 1925. The first commercial model of this machine, called the M-Scope, was available for the first time in 1936. It was featured in the publication " Radio For Everybody " as a "Radio Treasure
