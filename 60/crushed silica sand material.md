## Sand | Density, Heat Capacity, Thermal Conductivity - Material Properties
Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. The composition of sand varies, depending on the local rock sources and conditions, but the most common constituent of sand in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO2), usually in the form of quartz.

Sand size is designated by number: No. 8 sand is the largest and No. 30 is the smallest (table 5). The type of media also influences filtering ability. Crushed silica filters better than sand because the angular particles of the crushed material fit closer together. For a given sand number, crushed silica retains smaller particles than does
