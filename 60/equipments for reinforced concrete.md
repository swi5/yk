7. Reinforced Concrete. Concrete can crack and buckle in freezing weather, although winterizing it can help. Also, the salt used to melt ice can create pits and stains on concrete driveways. If you live in a cold climate with freezing winter weather, you may want to avoid concrete and opt for asphalt. General Maintenance and Cleaning.

## What is Reinforced Concrete? Uses, Benefits, and advantages
1. Strength. Reinforced concrete has very good strength in tension as well as compression. This makes concrete a desired construction material. Fig. 1: Strength of Concrete. 2. Economical. Concrete constituents are widely available worldwide and inexpensive. Similarly, the production cost of concrete is very low.

Most metal floats are now made of magnesium. A bull float is a large float used to smooth and level the surface of the concrete immediately after it is screeded. It typically includes a long pole for reaching across the form. Smaller floats are useful for filling small voids and smoothing areas close to the form edges.
