## Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
it appears, however, that the rate of ball and liner wear is greater in wet milling so the decision between wet and dry operation is, in cases where the choice is permitted, a matter of balancing the economic gain arising from reduced power demand and increased throughput against the increased cost of replacement of the ball charge and the mill .

## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
Jul 20, 2022The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.

The wet grinding of a gibbsite powder dispersed in water was examined by using two tumbling ball mills made of alumina and of stainless steel with three kinds of balls which were steel, alumina and glass.

The wet grinding process contain the utilize of water or similar liquid with which flowability of the support substance can be increased. It is attained by appending an interesting wind tool on the ball mill market. Our experts recommend users to present both dry and wet grinding process at low speed, which is named as ball mill c ritical speed.
