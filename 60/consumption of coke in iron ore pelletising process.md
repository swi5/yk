The Pelletizing Process. The production of iron ore pellets from fines to finished product can differ based on a variety of factors. As such, it's important to note that the process described here is a generalized approach subject to many variations. In general, three primary phases occur in iron ore pelletizing: Mixing/Preconditioning

## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes
Induration of green pellets consists of three main steps namely (i) drying of green pellets, (ii) firing of pellets at around 1300 deg C to sinter the iron oxide particles, and (iii) cooling of hot pellets before discharging. During drying (temperature range of 180 deg C to 350 deg C), moisture content of the green pellet is evaporated.

## Iron Ore Pellets and Pelletization Process - IspatGuru
Pelletizing of iron ore was started in the 1950s to facilitate the utilization of finely ground iron ore concentrates in steel production. For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely, the straight travelling grate (STG) process and the grate kiln (GK) process. In the STG process, a stationary bed of pellets is
