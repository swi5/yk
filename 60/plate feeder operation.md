## Vibrating Feeder Design - Stockpile & Reclaim | General Kinematics
Advantages of this feeder design: Large vibrating opening, up to 12′ x 12′, permits large hopper discharge openings for greater drawdown volume. Compact, low profile design reduces tunnel depth for substantial savings in foundation costs. Fixed or variable feed rate designs permit continuous operation to assure uniform feed to reclaim conveyor.
