## Abrasion Test | Test to Determine the Abrasion Value | Abrasion Test 
Therefore, aggregates used in road construction must be hard enough to resist Abrasion. The resistance offered by the aggregate to Abrasion is determined in the laboratory by the Los Angeles testing machine.. The Los Angeles abrasion test's working principle is to produce abrasive action using standard steel balls, which, when mixed with aggregates and spun in a drum for a specified time for
