## Open-Pit Mining Methods - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Open-pit mining methods are applicable to mining ore deposits that apex at or near the surface. If the deposit apexes below the surface, the overburden and barren capping overlying the ore must be removed in advance of open-pit mining. The removal of this material is known as stripping. The stripping-pit limits must be extended beyond the

## What Is Open-Pit Mining? Definition and Environmental Impact - Treehugger
Open-pit mining is a type of surface mining used to extract coal, gold, and other minerals. It creates immense water and air pollution, disfigures landscapes, and destroys habitats.  When mining equipment malfunctions or when workers such as welders make mistakes, coal ignites. Mine fires release toxic gases and cause significant air pollution.

## Open-pit Mining - Mining North Works
Open-pit mining occurs on surface and is generally the cheapest way to extract ore. This is because rock doesn't have to be moved far up hill against gravity, equipment used can be larger than underground, and it doesn't require more expensive features like ventilation, communications, etc. that underground does.

Open-pit mining Pit geometry. Deposits mined by open-pit techniques are generally divided into horizontal layers called benches. The thickness (that is, the height) of the benches depends on the type of deposit, the mineral being mined, and the equipment being used; for large mines it is on the order of 12 to 15 metres (about 40 to 50 feet).
