## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing (2022)
Copper process : The concentration of copper in ores averages only 0.6%, and most profitable ores are sulfides, especially chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and to a lesser extent chalcocite (Cu 2 S). These minerals are intense from crushed ores to the level of 10 to 15% copper by froth flotation or bioleaching.

Iron and sulfur are converted to oxides and are removed in either the gas stream or the slag (the latter being recycled for the recovery of remaining values), leaving a " blister" copper containing between 98.5 and 99.5 percent copper and up to 0.8 percent oxygen. The converter is rotated for skimming the slag and pouring the blister copper.

## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper)  The second step is solvent extraction, in which two immiscible (un-mixing) liquids are stirred and allowed to separate, causing the cooper to move from one liquid to the other. The pregnant leach solution is mixed vigorously with a solvent.

Copper can be lost during the process in one of the three ways: as copper oxides dissolved in the slag as copper sulfide dissolved in the slag as tiny droplets (or prills) of matte suspended in the slag. The amount of copper lost as copper oxide increases as the oxygen potential of the slag increases.

Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process beginning with the mining and concentrating of low-grade ores containing copper sulfide minerals and followed by smelting and electrolytic refining to produce a pure copper cathode.
