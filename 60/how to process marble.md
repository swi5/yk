Characteristics Of Marbles. Marble is a stone with a firm crystalline structure and slight porosity.

How Marble is Made. For marble to be made it needs two things: heat and movement. When a regional area of limestone is heated, either at a place of convergence between two of the earth's plates or as a result of magma within the earth as a heat source, the calcite crystals within the limestone begin to grow and recrystallize.
