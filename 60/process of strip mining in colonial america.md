## Strip Mining, Open-pit Mining, Surface Mining, Mining Techniques 
Strip mining, like other types of surface mining, finishes in hurting the area around the mine. The rock, gravel, trees, plants, and filth are dumped in regions round the mine. When it rains, this runs over the land and into watercourse and rivers. The rain pushes the mine filth on top of the region topsoil and buries it.

## Strip Mining: A Destructive Way of Coal Extraction
The process of strip mining also lowers groundwater levels around the mine. In order to remove the coal, vast quantities of groundwater are pumped out of the mine and as a result, surrounding ecosystems and farmland may become drier, and erosion may start to change the landscape. Strip mining also uses significant amount of water to suppress dust.

Mining practices were relatively sophisticated by the 1500s in Europe, especially in Germany. The same technologies used in Europe were installed in early colonial mines.
