## Jig Grinding and Jig Boring - Industrial Tool and Die, Inc.
Jig Grinding is a specialty process that allows us to grind complex geometrical shapes in our tools with extremely high precision and accuracy. Jig boring is a similar specialty machining process that allows toolmakers to produce precision holes on tools and dies with a high degree of positioning and size accuracy.

## How to Use a Jig Grinder Effectively
Any jig should have detailed instructions on base plates set-up on your grinder base and how to get the desired shape of the grind. You should keep the stick out of the tool to 2 inches past the jig. You need to drill a hole in the mount or base - to serve as a stop block to make that measurement quickly and accurately.

## Grinding | A Brief Overview of the Machining Process - SourceHorizon
Grinding. Grinding is a machining process used to improve surface finish, cut hard materials, and tighten the tolerance on flat and cylindrical part surfaces by removing a very small amount of material. While the grinding process has been vastly improved upon with the addition of CNC, it is still a very slow way to remove stock from a part.

A jig grinder is a machine tool used for grinding complex shapes and holes where the highest degrees of accuracy and finish are required.. The jig grinder is very similar to a jig borer, in that the table positioning and spindles are very accurate (far more so than a manual milling machine or lathe).It is almost exclusively used by tool and die makers in the creation of jigs or mating holes

## What is Drilling?- Definition, Process, and Tips
Drilling is a cutting process that uses a drill bit to cut a hole with a circular cross-section in solid materials. The drill is usually a rotating cutting tool, often multi-point. The bit is pressed against the workpiece and rotated at speeds of hundreds to thousands of revolutions per minute. As a result, the cutting edge is pressed against
