## Limestone: Rock Uses, Formation, Composition, Pictures - Geology
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.

## How To Find Limestone - Realonomics
How can you identify limestone? Limestone is a very hard rock so try and crumble it in your hand or fingers. If it starts to come off in your hand then you don't have limestone. It is very possible that if you have limestone you have something that has fossil imprints in it. See if you can spot any areas where marine life might have been.

Lime is used extensively in the recovery of gold and silver. Ores, either run-of-mine, milled, autoclaved or roasted, are combined with lime and a cyanide solution. The cyanide dissolves the gold and silver. Lime maintains proper pH in the cyanide solution, keeping it in the liquid phase and preventing the formation of hydrogen cyanide gas and its loss into the atmosphere.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

【Process Introduction】 Dolomite mining process is the solution of separating dolomite concentrate from Dolomite raw ore. Based on mosaic structure of the Dolomite mine and years of mining process experiences, Xinhai applying Dolomite mining process of two-stage crushing, washing, then three-stage separating, flotation process will be used to process Dolomite with complex structures.
