## Cryogenics. Nitrogen is the most used and ideal gas for cryogenic 
The terms milling, size reduction, comminution, grinding and pulverization are often used interchangeably. Milling is a unit operation where mechanical energy is applied to physically break down coarse particles to finer ones and hence, is regarded as a "top-down" approach in the production of fine particles [13].

Crushed ore is fed to the ball mill through the inlet; a scoop (small screw conveyor) ensures the feed is constant. For both wet and dry ball mills, the ball mill is charged to approximately 33% with balls (range 30-45%). Pulp (crushed ore and water) fills another 15% of the drum's volume so that the total volume of the drum is 50% charged.

## dry ball mill feed size - Traxo
Ball Mill Feed System Dry Milling. Ball mills give a controlled final grind and produce flotation feed of a uniform size. Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5-10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel.
