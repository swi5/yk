## Cement Manufacturing Process | Phases | Flow Chart | Cement
Cement Manufacturing Process Phase 1: Raw Material Extraction. Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. Such raw materials are limestone, clay and sand. Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand & clay fulfill the need of silicon, iron and aluminum.

## PROCESS OF CEMENT AND CONCRETE PRODUCTION
The process continues with grinding the material, and then cement is produced. At the final stage, cement is packaged into bags and is ready for the production of concrete. The first step of making concrete is combining different materials. Cement is mixed with water, sand and small stones in the proportions of 10%, 25% and 50% respectively.

The process traps many small pockets of air between the glass, and these small air pockets result in high thermal insulation properties. Glass wool is produced in rolls or in slabs, with different thermal and mechanical properties.. Concrete was produced by replacing general-purpose cement with 10%, 20% and 30% of recycled glass powder.

These compounds are also known as Bogue Compounds. When water is added to cement a chemical reaction between water and cement takes place leading to the evolution of heat. This is called hydration of cement. The product formed is C-S-H gel. The heat liberated during this reaction is called the heat of hydration.
