## Concrete made from desert sand | I'MNOVATION
Sand is one of the basic materials in the production of concrete. But, although it would seem an abundant material, the type of sand that can be found in the deserts is too thin and smooth to bind properly. And thus, construction companies resort to riverbank sands, a dwindling resource. A group of young researchers from the Imperial College

## Replacement Of Sand With Quarry Dust In Concrete Production
The project is about replacing sand in concrete production with quarry dust at varying percentage (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) to check if the strength matches that of grade MIS with a mix ratio of I :2:4 and also the proportion which has the highest strength. The test carried out includes particle size analysis, slump test, and compressive test.

## What Is Construction Sand? - Carpentry and construction business
Manufactured sand (M-Sand) is used in the production of concrete as a replacement for river sand. Crushing hard granite stone yields manufactured sand, which is used in construction. The crushed sand is cubical in shape with grounded edges, and it has been cleaned and graded to be used as a building material.

The descriptive statistics of the data are shown in Fig. 7.1.Out of 29 wells, sand production was observed in 21 wells. Since data attributes have different ranges, it is recommended to scale the data between 0 and 1 for the learning process (data set can also be standardized; the proper data transformation can be determined by the performance of the model which will be explained in this chapter).
