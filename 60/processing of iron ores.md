## Extraction of Iron, Iron Mining, Iron Ore Processing - Xinhai Mining
Magnetite Iron Ore Processing. Because of the strong magnetism of magnetite, the extraction of iron from magnetite is weak magnetic separation technology. The magnetite iron ore processing maninly includes: It is suitable for the extraction of iron from simple single magnetite. It can be divided into successive-grinding weak magnetic separation

Processing of Magnetite Iron Ores - Comparing Grinding Options. Although the majority of current steel production is supported by iron ore sourced from high grade haemetite deposits, the long-term growing demand for steel has led to higher raw material prices and opened the way for many new magnetite deposits to also be developed.

## Iron Ore Production Procedure
The iron-ores that are charged into the process go through fluidized bed reactors where they are heated and reduced to Direct Reduced Iron (DRI). The DRI is then charged into the melter gasifier where the final reduction and melting as well as the production of reducing gas by gasification of coal with oxygen takes place (Schenk, 2022).

## Iron Ore | METS Engineering
Iron Ore. Australia is the largest producer of iron ore in the world, producing approximately 37% of the world's production (USGS 2018). Iron ore is categorised depending on where it is produced and priced, by its iron content and level of impurities. The main minerals associated with iron ore processing are hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ), magnetite

## Ore Sorting | Preceding Processing | Ausenco - Ausenco English
Wet drum magnetic separators are typically used for heavy media applications, iron ore beneficiation, mineral processing and the reclamation or concentration of iron-bearing minerals, with Eriez manufacturing multiple diameters, widths and tank designs in order to accommodate the various requirements for the metallic ore processing industries.
