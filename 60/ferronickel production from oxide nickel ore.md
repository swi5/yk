Received 15 January 2016; accepted 16 April 2016; published 19 April 2016. ABSTRACT. Based on the process of coal-based self-reduction and melting separation at high temperature, it was investigated that the effect of process factors on the reduction of iron and nickel oxide, the metal yield and the nickel content in ferronickel about the laterite nickel ore, was from Philippines and contented

May 24, 2021Abstract Ferronickel, currently obtained from oxidized nickel ores in various aggregates, contains from 5 to 20% of Ni. According to experiments, rich ferronickel (with a content of Ni of about 70%) can be obtained from the melt of silicate-nickel ore treated with reducing gas.

Ferronickel and Nickel Pig Iron (NPI) are two alternatives to nickel metal. NPI typically contains around 4 to 10 wt% nickel. Its high amount of carbon (>3 wt%), silicon

The nickel ore deposits in the Kosovo are of oxide laterite type. The NewCo Ferronikeli plant is a two line plant. It was built in 1984 using largely Soviet technology, but with certain elements such as the electric furnaces, rotary kilns and casting machines, based on Western designs. Ferronickel production at NewCo Ferronikeli

competitive prices. Nickel ore from the Philippines is of relatively lower grade (i.e. lower nickel content, meaning that every unit of nickel ore contains a lower amount of nickel), and accordingly, the average nickel content of the nickel ore used in our ferronickel production decreased from 1.65% in 2020 to 1.54% in 2021. As a result of the use of lower - 219 -

## Sulfide Copperuid24
Sulfide Copper Ores, Virtually all sulfide-type copper ores, including chalcocite (Cu 2 S), chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and covellite (CuS), are treated by smelting.After crushing the ore to a fine powder, it is concentrated by froth flotation, which requires mixing the powdered ore with reagents that combine with the copper to make it hydrophobic. They have a yield strength of between 1400 and
