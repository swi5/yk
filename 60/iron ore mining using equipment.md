Regions in which iron ore has formed over millions of years (e.g. through volcanism) and can be mined economically are also referred to as iron ore deposits. Especially many ore deposits can be found in countries such as China, Australia, Brazil, India and Russia. These countries account for around 85 % of the total global iron ore mining volume.

## NATURAL RESOURCES SUSTAINABILITY: IRON ORE MINING - SciELO
Depending on the end-use of the iron ore(pig iron, sponge iron, commodities such as cement, etc.), different mineral properties are required. Table 5. Iron ore sizes (CVRD 1985, QUARESMA 1987) Iron ore is subjected to several processing stages to increase the iron content and reduce the amount of mineral impurities, depending on its end use.
