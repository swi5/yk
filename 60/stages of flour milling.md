Flour milling is a complex process of separating the endosperm of a wheat kernel from the bran, and germ. Modern flour mills are large multi-step processes with multiple milling stages to break and reduce the wheat particles and sieves and sifters to separate the various components. The finished flour is a high-value product, and milling

Flour Milling Process. After wheat washing and wheat conditioning the grinding steps of separating bran endosperm and malt can be carried out. The whole flour milling process is divided into rough grinding purification and fine grinding. Rough grinding is to slightly split the skin of wheat grains and take out of the coarse grains and flaky.

Commercial milling removes the nutrient-filled part of the kernel, namely the germ, bran, and endosperm. When milling your own whole wheat, these are included in your final result, making your flour more nutritious than its commercial counterpart. Taste Perhaps most importantly, the taste of the flour that you mill yourself is far better.

In this stage, wheat is received at the flour mill where it is inspected. Samples of wheat are taken for both physical and chemical analysis. In this process, wheat is graded based on some factors but the most important factor is the protein content. The wheat is then kept into silos waiting to be milled.

The Milling Process UK Flour Millers. The flour milling process has evolved from wheat being ground between two large stone wheels (although this process does still occur in a few mills). In a roller mill the practice centres around separating the three components of a wheat seed the white endosperm, the outer bran layers and the wheat germ

## How is flour made? What is plain flour? Is white flour bleached? - FAB
History of flour milling. Grains have been ground to make flour since the Roman times - from 6000BC onwards. Grains were toasted to remove the chaff from the wheat and then smashed between two stones. The resultant flour was coarse and grainy. Evidence of sifting has been found so we know that even then, people were making fine, soft flour.
