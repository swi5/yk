The Aggregate is a concept created to enforce business rules (invariants). Its implementation may vary depending on the paradigm we use, but In object-oriented programming, it is an object-oriented graph as Martin Fowler describes it: A DDD aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit.
