When using SOLIDWORKS Simulation, a bearing connector simulates the support and movement between a housing support and a shaft, without needing a physical bearing component.

When a system includes a centrifugal pump, an important design issue is matching the head loss-flow characteristic with the pump so that it operates at or close to the point of its maximum efficiency. Pump efficiency is an important aspect and pumps should be regularly tested. Thermodynamic pump testing is one method.
