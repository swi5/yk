## 5 Benefits of Induction Melting Furnaces In Steel Production
Induction melting foundry have a lesser negative impact on the environment compared to electrical furnaces. The process records reduced emissions of gas, smoke, and dust associated with other types of casting forges. The induction metal furnaces are cleaner with greater control over emissions and their release to the environment.

Magnetic field induces an electrical current. The metal isn't a perfect conductor, the resistance in the metal bleeds some of energy off as heat. With enough of a magnetic field, the metal can melt. Wait, but for an induced current in the conductor I thought there had to be change in flux through the conductor.

Feb 6, 2022In the past 60 years, the melting of various ferrous charge metals in coreless induction furnaces has changed. As the quality of the metallic charge constituents steadily deteriorated, slag-related melting problems such as slag build-up became widespread. Slower melting rates and less efficient use of the coreless induction furnace result.
