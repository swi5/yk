## Fineness Modulus of Coarse Aggregates and its Calculation
The cumulative percentage retained on each sieve is added and subtracted by 100 gives the value of fine aggregate. Higher the aggregate size higher the Fineness modulus hence fineness modulus of coarse aggregate is higher than fine aggregate. Coarse aggregate means the aggregate which is retained on 4.75mm sieve when it is sieved through 4.75mm.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test Method - Project Management 123
Crushing Value Test Procedure. Select clean and dry aggregate passing through 12.5 mm and retained on 10.0 mm sieve. Weight the empty cylindrical measure. Let the weight be 'a' grams. Fill the aggregate in the cylindrical measure in three layers, tamping each layer 25 times with the rounded end of the tamping rod.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test, Crushing Value Test of Aggregate
Mar 1, 2021Procedure of Aggregate Crushing Value Test:-. Sieve the test material through 12.5 mm and 10.0 mm IS sieve. Take test samples of aggregates passing through 12.5 mm IS sieve and retained on 10 mm IS sieve (minimum 3 Kg). Dry theme in an oven for 4 hours at a temperature of 100 °C to 110 °C and then cool at room temperature.
