## Working Principle and Types of Milling Machine
Adjustable working table of milling machine will hold the workpiece and movement of adjustable working table will govern the feeding of workpiece against rotating milling cutter. As we have discussed above, rotating cutter will be mounted with spindle which will be driven by electric motor and hence rotating cutter will rotates with high rpm.
