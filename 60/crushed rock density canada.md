Crushed stone Crushed stone is a type of medium-sized gravel that is formed by mechanically crushing stone. Most commonly, limestone, dolomite, or granite is crushed to form the crushed stone. In certain definitions of the term, crushed stone is not considered gravel since it is a processed rather than naturally-occurring rock fragment.

As an example, a 10-foot wide, 20-foot long driveway is a 200-square foot area. Then, multiply the area by the depth. For instance, if you are using four inches of crushed stone under a patio area or for a driveway, four inches converted to feet is .33. So, our calculation is .33 x 200 Ã· 27, or 2.46 cubic yards.

For rocks without sensitive minerals such as smectites, the porosity and dry, grain, and saturated densities can be derived from the saturated mass, dry mass, and volume (or buoyant weight). These measurements allow calculation of saturated, dry, and grain density as well as porosity and mineral and pore volume by employing Eqs. 3 through 5 .
