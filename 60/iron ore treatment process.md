## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview - IntechOpen
This chapter aims to provide an overview and the evolution of iron ore pelletizing process including: 2. Pelletizing process and raw materials. The iron ore is mined mostly from open pit deposits through mining operations and the raw product, "run of mine," is subjected to mineral processing.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ore - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Beneficiation of Iron Ore and the treatment of magnetic iron taconites, stage grinding and wet magnetic separation is standard practice.This also applies to iron ores of the non-magnetic type which after a reducing roast are amenable to magnetic separation. All such plants are large tonnage operations treating up to 50,000 tons per day and ultimately requiring grinding as fine as minus 500

The process includes the reuse of scrap metal, water, and energy, as well as the production of advanced steel products. A large percentage of co-products is recycled, such as food cans. In addition, the recycled material is magnetic, which makes it easy to separate from other metals. This is why it is used in so many everyday products.
