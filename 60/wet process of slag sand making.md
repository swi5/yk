## What is wet blasting? | Vapormatt
Wet blasting is the use of an abrasive media and compressed air to achieve a desired finish on a chosen surface. Unlike dry blasting, wet blasting (or Vapormatting) uses a third element - liquid - to enhance the levels of surface finish that can be achieved. The benefit of including water is a much smoother and more consistent finish.
