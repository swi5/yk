## Silicon Dioxide: The Shocking Truth About this Food Additive
The most common use of silicon dioxide in your food is as an anti-clumping agent. It's added to your food so that your crackers stay crisp, your garlic powder won't stick and your cereal stays fresh. Of course, as with any other naturally occurring substance, it has other non-food uses as well. What scares many people is that silicon

## Silicon - Energy Education
The most common compound of silicon is silicon dioxide, or SiO 2. This compound is the most abundant compound in the Earth's crust, and it takes the form of ordinary sand, quartz, rock crystal, amethyst, agate, flint, jasper, and opal. Pure silicon is produced by heating silicon dioxide with carbon at temperatures approaching 2200°C.
