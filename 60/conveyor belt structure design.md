## Belt Conveyor Structural Design - Standards
Experts, What standard do your companies use in the design of the structures that support belt conveyors? The structural verification itself isn't really an issue. The loads and load combinations, however, can create some interesting discussions. The belt conveyor isn't a building to be designed as per ASCE 7-05 or AISE Nr 13 and neither is a mobile machine to comply with ISO 5049-1, AS-4324

A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems. A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with an endless loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt and the material on the belt forward.

## The Structure design of Corrugated Sidewall Belt Conveyor
The Structure design of Corrugated Sidewall Belt Conveyor. 2. Due to the diaphragm plate on the conveyor belt, relevant ways should be taken to feed materials into conveyor for avoiding collision between materials and baffles; 4. In the return branch, a part similar to the traditional belt conveyor is used to limit the swing of the conveyor belt.
