Calcium stearate belongs to a "film former" category of lubricants. Film former lubricants are "fusion promoters" only when their melt viscosity is higher at processing temperature. When calcium stearate melts (M. Pt. 155° C for commercial grade ), it has a glassy, crystalline, tacky liquid structure.
