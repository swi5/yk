## Materials conveyors: A guide for specifying belt conveyor systems
The first step in the design of a belt conveyor with a specified conveyor capacity is to determine the speed and width of the belt. The magnitude of the belt speed can be determined using: equation. Where: C = Conveyor capacity. r = Material density (kg/m3) V = Belt speed (m/s) A = Conveyor's belt cross-sectional area.

The conveyor belt basically consists of a support stand, a drive, one driving pulley and one extremity pulley. The drive is positioned directly In the driving pulley. This conveyor belt design has a very simple construction and has minimal maintenance requirements. This design is preferable if there are no space restrictions.

The conveyor belt system's standard structure has three layers: a top cover, carcass, and bottom cover. However, some applications require multiple layers of the conveyor belt. The layers of the belt depending on the products that you want to move. Steel, aramid, polyester, nylon, and cotton are some most common carcass layer's materials.
