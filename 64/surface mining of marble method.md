## marble mining methods and technology
What are the main methods of mining? American, There are four main mining methods underground, open surface pit, placer, and in-situ mining Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels, beach sands

## 4.3.1: Surface Mining Methods | ABC 123: Testing Site / Course
Solution mining is used to recover deep deposits that would be uneconomical using underground methods, but only if the ore can be easily dissolved by a solvent. In this method, holes are drilled from the surface into the deposit. A solvent is pumped down one hole, and the resulting solution with the dissolved mineral is pumped out another hole.

## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

## The incredible marble extraction process - Stone and Style
September 13, 2013. Marble deposits can be exploited in open pits, it can be 95% on outdoor quarries and 5% in caves or mines. Marble is located at ground level or at great depths which make the cost too high for removal. Formerly, the extraction of this stone was done manually with wooden wedges, halters, ropes, picks and shovels. Nowadays

## Surface Mining Methods
Regardless of the necessity or economic advantage, all surface solution methods share two common characteristics: (1) ore is mined in the usual way and then stockpiled; and, (2) an aqueous solution is applied to the top of the ore stock which reacts chemically with the metal of interest from which the resulting metal salt solution is channelled through the stock pile for collection and processing.
