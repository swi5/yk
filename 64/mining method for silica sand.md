## Silica Mining - JXSC Mining
Silica Mining What is Silica. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is silicon dioxide (SiO2). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.

Silica Sand. Silica sand, also known as silica or quartz sand, is a kind of hard, wear-resistant and chemical stable silicate mineral. Its main mineral composition is SiO2. According to different mining and processing methods, silica sand can be divided into artificial silica sand, water washed sand, scrubbed sand, selected (flotation) sand, etc.

Sources of Silica Sand: SiO2 is the chemical sign of silica and it is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Oxygen and Silicon. This sand is often got in the crystalline state and because of weathering, plankton fossilization takes place and that results in crystallizing SiO2. In most regions of the world, these are found as mines and it is obtained in high hardness.
