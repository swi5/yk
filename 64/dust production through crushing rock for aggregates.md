## Dust suppression a must for quarries | Aggregates Business
Dust from quarries tends to be unavoidable, particularly when the weather is very dry. Activities, including the drilling, blasting, loading, hauling, conveying and crushing and screening of rocks all generate dust as does transporting the finished products. According to Sustainable Aggregates in the UK, predicting the level of dust emission is extremely difficult because of the complex nature
