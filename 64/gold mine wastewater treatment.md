Sorption technique was employed to remove heavy metals from gold mining effluent using natural and plant materials for sustainability. An assessment of the effluent quality of a gold mining company in Ghana indicated that arsenic, copper and cyanide were the major pollutants in the process effluent. Arsenic and copper were successfully removed from the effluent by the studied materials. The

[10] reported the treatment of gold mining wastewater using chitosan and found that the removal of Cu, Pb and Zn was not affected by the presence of other metals because they were present at low concentrations. The speciation of metallic ions in gold mining tailings wastewater depends on their

## Extracting Mineral Acid from Mining Wastewater
The remaining sludge is recycled in an acid mine drainage treatment tank or a settling pond. This method is relatively economical, but is not particularly efficient, as reaction times can be long and produce a discharge with relatively higher trace metals.

## Mining Industrial Wastewater Treatment - Nexom
Never worry about your tailings and wastewater treatment again. If your mine is like most, chances are it faces challenges other treatment plants don't.. it is remote and you're looking for a reliable, simple-to-operate system that doesn't take a Ph.D to operate.; it produces high-strength contaminants and you need a treatment system that can consistently produce compliance.
