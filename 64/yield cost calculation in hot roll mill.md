##  1. Hot rolling and rolling defects: 1.1 Front and back tensions
bulged rolls, when subjected to bending during rolling will produce flat sheets. For sheet rolling, normally camber of 0.5 mm on roll diameter is provided. Also during hot rolling, rolls get heated up and bulge out at the center, causing camber of the rolls. This is due to temperature variation between edges and the center of rolls.

## The calculation of rolling force - Innoval Technology
Yield strength. The main factor influencing the rolling force required to reduce the thickness of strip in a rolling mill is the yield strength of the material being rolled. The calculation of yield strength depends upon a wide range of factors. These are: composition; previous work done on the material; thermal history; speed of rolling

A36 Hot Rolled. ASTM A36 steel is the most common of the hot-rolled steels. It is available in a wide variety of shapes. The hot roll process means that the steel was brought to approximate finished size by rolling at elevated temperatures. Its yield strength is significantly less than 1018 - It will bend much more quickly than 1018 will.

The rolled throughput rate is a factor of the first pass yield rates of each step being multiplied together. With this case, 10 steps all with 95% first pass yields rates will be about 60%, which is not as high as you would like. This shows how even 5% of products, when accumulated over many steps, can add up to be a large quantity of rework.
