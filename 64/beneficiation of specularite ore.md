An iron ore contains specularite and hematite which are its main iron minerals and carbonates such as calcite which are its main gangue minerals. The ore is very apt to produce slime in the grinding process,leading to a deteriorated beneficiability. The rough iron concentrate can be obtained by using high gradient magnetic separator to discard tailings with the grinding fineness of 95% -0.074mm.
