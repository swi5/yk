Extraction of metal from an ore depends on the place it has in the reactivity series. Following points explain this. Metals found at the bottom of reactivity series are least reactive and they are often found in nature in free-state, such as gold, silver, copper, etc. Copper and silver are also found in the form of sulphide and oxide ores.

Once broken into smaller pieces, the charcoal and iron ore (sand) are mixed together in a 1:1 ratio. 4. Charge the furnace. Before adding the iron ore and charcoal mixture, the furnace must be charged. Charging a furnace simply means heating it up to temperatures high enough for smelting to occur.
