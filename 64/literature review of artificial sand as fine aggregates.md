To break it down, 2 cubic yards of mulch would be 18, 3 cubic foot bags of mulch. So, say it takes 5 minutes to put down each 3 cubic foot bag (5 minutes X 18 = 90 minutes)then it would be right at 90 minutes which is 1 1/2 hours. This wasn't a choice so I picked 2 hours. Explanation: Two people can spread 1 yard of mulch within 15 minutes usually.

## Use of waste foundry sand as fine aggregates for structural  - Emerald
Waste foundry sand (WFS) is a by-product of the metal casting industries and is used for land filling purposes. Disposing of waste creates problems to environment and increases disposal values. To reduce environmental pollutions and solving disposal problems, several authors in worldwide are carried out research work by partial and complete replacing of natural sand with WFS in concrete mixtures.

The natural fine sand is replaced with foundry sand (5, 10 and 15% by mass) to achieve a high-strength concrete of about 65 MPa, gaining that value at 56 days of curing with 10% waste foundry sand replacement: this is the optimum re

Fine aggregates have four different moisture conditions: oven-dry, air-dry, saturated-surface dry, and wet. Fine aggregate in wet conditions can hold 5% moisture. It can cause bulking problems while forming concrete. Ideally, the moisture content of sand for construction works should not be more than 5%. 3.

Artificial sand, also called crushed sand or mechanical sand (m sand), refers to rocks, mine tailings or industrial waste granules with a particle size of less than 4.75 mm. It is processed by mechanical crushing and sieving. In China, the artificial sand was mainly used in the construction of hydropower systems.
