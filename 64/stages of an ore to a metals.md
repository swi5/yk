## Stages Of Metal Extraction From An Ore
The extraction of metals from their ores . The extraction of metals from their ores generally involves three stages: - 1. Ore concentration; 2. Reduction to the crude metal; 3. Refining to obtain the pure metal Ore Concentration An ore is a compound of the metal (usually the oxides, sulphides, chlorides and carbonates) mixed with large amounts

The process has four stages: a) concentration of the ore b) roasting of the ore in air c) conversion of zinc oxide to zinc sulfate  Metallic cadmium and other valuable metals may also be recovered in the reining process. Secondary production. Over 35% of the zinc used annually is from recycled metal. Much of this comes from zinc-coated steel

Very few metal ores occur in a pure enough form to be used directly in the extraction process. The first stage is to separate the useful ore from the rock. This may not be necessary in some cases, for example, the extraction of iron, but essential in the extraction of aluminium.

## Ore Refining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
7.1.6 METAL REFINING OF ORES. In the metal refining of ores, the metal is solubilized in an aqueous solution. The optical control of metal refining requires quick, accurate analysis of the major chemical species present in solution. Raman spectroscopy and resonance Raman are used to identify the amine complexes of Co, Ni, and Cu species, as
