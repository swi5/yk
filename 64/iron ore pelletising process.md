## What is iron ore pelletization?pro
Iron ore pellets are spheres of typically 6-16 mm (0.24-0.63 in) to be used as raw material for blast furnaces.  The process of pelletizing combines mixing of the raw material, forming the pellet and a thermal treatment baking the soft raw pellet to hard spheres.

## A review of binders in iron ore pelletization - Taylor & Francis
The most common agglomeration technique is pelletization, which requires the use of binders to hold the iron oxide grains together so that the agglomerates can be sintered into high-strength pellets. Although bentonite clay is the most commonly used binder, there are many other possibilities that could be competitive in a number of situations.

Iron ore pellets and Pelletizing processes. Pelletizing is a process that involves mixing very finely ground particles of iron ore fines of size less than 200 mesh with additives like bentonite and then shaping them into oval/spherical lumps of 8-16 mm in diameter by a pelletizer and hardening the balls by firing with a fuel.

## Iron Ore Pelletization: Part I. Fundamentals - Taylor & Francis
Mar 15, 2021The behavior of iron ore pellet binders is complex. Any pellet binder is subject to a handful of practical requirements: that it be readily dispersed through a pellet, that it effectively controls the movement of water within the pellet, and that it contributes to the inter-particle bonding within the pellet.

## Pelletizing Plants | BOLLFILTER
Pelletizing is the process through which iron ore fines are transformed into an agglomerated form called "iron ore pellets" suitable for use in an iron-making furnace at a steel mill, such as a blast furnace or electric arc furnace. In its end product form, a typical iron ore pellet is roughly spherical in shape, measuring from 6 mm to 16

Iron Ore Pellets Screening Solutions - Metal 7. Iron Ore Pellets Screening Solutions The size distribution of iron ore pellets is among the most important quality parameters for the end users of those pellets, the steel mills. The tighter the distribution is, the better the performance and energy efficient the steel making process will be.
