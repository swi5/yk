## Transportation Of Iron Ore In Form Of Pellets
 Pellets are obtained byadding an appropriate amount of water to the iron ore concentrate; this is a fundamental factor in the formation and growth of pellets, which creates a surface tension that holds the mineral grains cohesive, thus allowing their handling [6, 8]. Fines are produced during transportation, handling and storing of iron pellets.

## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes
Pelletizing is a process which involves mixing of very finely ground particles of iron ore fines having a size which is less than 200 mesh (0.074 mm) with additives like bentonite and then shaping them into near oval/spherical balls having size in the range of 8 mm to 16 mm in diameter by a pelletizer and hardening the balls by firing with a fuel.

Iron Ore (fines) Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, deep purple, to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ), hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite

## Recycling and Reuse of Iron Ore Pellet Fines | SpringerLink
Apr 5, 2022During the process of iron ore pelletization and preparation of feed for DRI or reduction smelting processes, around 3% of pellet fines (less than 8 mm) are generated as undesired product in the existing pellet plants. Such pellet fines acquire more than 24 million tonnes generated all over the world. Recycling and reuse of these high grade
