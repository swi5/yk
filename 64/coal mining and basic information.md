## Coal Mining -The 2 Most Basic Techniques Of Extraction
They are two most basic methods that miners use to quarry coal. While surface mining is used for coal that can be found anywhere from the surface to 200 feet below, underground mining is used for coal that is located lower. In surface mining, the top layer is removed which may include plants, soil rocks. This exposes the coal below the top layer.

Illinois employs three basic types of coal mining: room and pillar, longwall, and surface or strip mining. The first two are forms of underground mining, while the third, as the name implies is done from the surface. Illinois produced approximately 52 million tons of coal in 2013.

Facts about Coal Facts about Coal Mining Coal is extracted from underground and from surface mines (sometimes called strip mines). Since coal is deposited in broad layers or seams, between 40 and 60 percent of the coal from underground mines must be left behind as pillars to prevent cave-ins and collapse of the surface.

The environmental aspects of mining have received little analysis. U.S. coals vary in moisture content (2 to 40%), sulfur content (0.2 to 8%) and ash content (5 to 40%).
