Jan 11, 2022What is surface and underground mining? The two major categories of modern mining include surface mining and underground mining. In surface mining the ground is blasted so that ores near Earth's surface can be removed and carried to refineries to extract the minerals. . In underground mining ores are removed from deep within the earth.

People would die because the rocks would fall on top of them, or they would get trapped. A lot of people got lost underground, and died..
