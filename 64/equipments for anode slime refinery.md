Nov 1, 2021The copper anode slime came from Yunnan Copper Co., Ltd. The chemical composition of the anode slime is presented in Table 1 by quantitative chemical assays. The copper anode slime was dried at 80 °C for 24 h and followed by pestling and screening to gain a powder of fewer than 80 μm. The phase transition was acquired by an X-ray diffractometer.

## Treatment of copper refinery anode slime - Institute of Nuclear Energy 
A process for the removal of lead content in anode slime by subjecting the latter to primary and secondary leach in a medium of an ammonium acetate solution at a temperature not exceeding 80° C. Whereby lead dissolution is maximized and other metals are minimized. Separate the leach solution from the undissolved slime residue, crystallize lead

## Electrometallurgy of copper refinery anode slimes
High-selenium copper refinery anode slimes form two separate and dynamically evolving series of compounds with increasing electrolysis time. In one, silver is progressively added to non-stoichiometric copper selenides, both those originally present in the anode and those formed subsequently in the slime layer, and in the other, silver-poor copper selenides undergo a dis-continuous

solar pool cover reviews and buying guide Call (800) Platinum Refining Platinum refineries provide an economical and environmentally friendly precious metal recovery service. We buy platinum scrap and separate the pure platinum from other precious metals and waste materials.Platinum scrap such as platinum coins, palladium PD and platinum wire is weighed and then smelted.

## Hydrometallurgical process for the recovery of  - TrademarkElite
This example illustrates the process for the extraction of tellurium from copper refinery anode slime sample (A). Raw anode slime of 1 kg is leached with a pulp density (solid to liquid ratio) of 20% at ambient temperature for one hour in sulphuric acid solution of 1.1 M concentration. The decopperisation efficiency is found to be about 92.2%.
