## Why is labor productivity in the United Kingdom so low?
Despite the labor and capital market reforms of the past 20 years, output per capita in the market sector remains almost 40 percent behind that of the United States, and 20 percent behind that of West Germany. The root cause of this gap is low labor productivity. The results of our productivity case studies confirm this overall trend.
