## High Intensity Magnetic Separation Fundamentals
Separations occur when the paramagnetic particles are deflected from the diamagnetic particle stream. Wet High Intensity Magnetic Separators incorporate a matrix which is magnetized by an externally produced magnetic field. The matrix amplifies the applied field and produces very high gradients. The feed slurry flows through the matrix which

## Everything You Need to Know About Wet Media Milling, Step By Step
Step 1: Wetting. The first step to wet grinding is eliminating air from the surface of the raw feed, so that each individual particle is fully in contact with the liquid slurry. Ensuring complete contact is vital for effective milling. This requires a liquid with lower surface tension than the free surface energy of the solid.

## wet magnetic separation process
Our STEINERT wet drum magnetic separators are used in the fine grain range from 1 µm up to 3000 µm (0.001 mm - 3 mm) to separate magnetic particles from process liquids, sludges or emulsions. Their strong magnetic fields enable the efficient separation of magnetite or ferrosilicon from the wet medium.
