Effects on Food And Beverage. Iron in drinking water causes it to develop an unpleasant metallic taste. If you use this water to make any beverages such as tea or coffee, their taste also gets affected. Also, water with high iron content will blacken fruits, vegetables, and other foods cooked in it and spoil the flavor.

## How can metal mining impact the environment?
In some cases, bioavailable metals are absorbed by plants and animals, causing detrimental effects. Although current U.S. mining and reclamation practices guided by environmental regulations minimize or prevent waste rock erosion into streams, disposal of waste rock in places where it could erode into surface drainages has occurred historically.
