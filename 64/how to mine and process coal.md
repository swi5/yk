## A 101 On Strip Mining And How It Is Used To Extract Coal
The actual mining occurs at this step. It is done in a narrow strip in an elongated form. First, the primary strip is mined for coal. After it is extracted thoroughly, the second strip is created by removing filth, rock, and waste from the top. This debris is dumped on top of the first and used strip. The process repeated till the last strip is

## How Coal Works | Union of Concerned Scientists
How coal is formed. Coal is formed when dead plant matter submerged in swamp environments is subjected to the geological forces of heat and pressure over hundreds of millions of years. Over time, the plant matter transforms from moist, low-carbon peat, to coal, an energy- and carbon-dense black or brownish-black sedimentary rock.

## Acid Mine Drainage: Origins and Assessment of Methods
An Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) is water that drains out from coal deposit mining areas and has a lower pH which has been occasioned by the presence of sulphuric acid. In other words, an Acid Mine Drainage is usually acidic although not all mine drainages are acidic. This acidity is due to the high concentration of sulphuric acid.

Once a mining lease has been awarded to an operator, exploration (i.e. evaluation of the resource) takes place, followed by a planning and development process before excavation or mining begins.  Once access has been gained into the coal seam, workings are developed by mining a series of roadways (or "headings"). These

Coal preparation. As explained above, during the formation of coal and subsequent geologic activities, a coal seam may acquire mineral matter, veins of clay, bands of rock, and igneous intrusions.In addition, during the process of mining, a portion of the roof and floor material may be taken along with the coal seam in order to create adequate working height for the equipment and miners.

Room-and-pillar mining may leave as much as 60 percent of the coal in supporting pillars after initial mining. Later, some of these pillars are removed as equipment retreats from the mined area. Long-wall mining permits increased recovery of coal by extracting coal along a single face which is much longer than used in room-and-pillar mining.

The process is repeated until the coal seam is mined. Another method, called longwall mining, accounts for about 20 percent of production. This method involves pulling a cutting machine across a 400 to 600 foot long face (longwall) of the coal seam. This machine has a revolving cylinder with tungsten bits that shear off the coal.

Mining & Processing. Coal in Wyoming is uncovered and removed by large machines in a process called surface mining. Before the coal can be removed from the ground, the topsoil and dirt above it is removed using scrapers. This soil is usually removed ahead of the pit and carried behind to place on top of reclaimed areas or backfill.
