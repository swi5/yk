The momentum of a body is the product of its mass and velocity. We can consider the conveyor belt and the sand present on it as the system at each instant. The mass of the system keeps on changing as more and more sand falls on it, and hence the momentum also changes, which will give a value for the external force. Formula used:

Examples of conveyors include a drag-chain con-veyor for hot clinker, a screw conveyor for limestone, and a belt conveyor to take ore from a primary to a secondary crusher The main difference between a feeder and a conveyor is that feeders are flood-loaded while conveyors are not Also, while conveyors typically operate at a constant speed, feed-.

## Sand drops on a conveyor belt at constant rate | Physics Forums
Jan 8, 2021When the sand grains are falling on the conveyor belt, there is inelastic collision as a consequence of which, the sand sticks to the surface of the conveyor belt and starts moving alongwith the belt. If, instead of inelastic collision, elastic collision would have happened, then the sand particles would have bounced back in the direction

## Solved 12. Sand is dropped straight down on a moving - Chegg
12. Sand is dropped straight down on a moving conveyor belt at the rate of 3.0 kg/s. If friction in the bearings can be ignored the power that must be expended to keep the belt moving at 7.0 m/s is: 14. A shearing force of 500. N is applied to an aluminum rod with a cross section area of 3.00x10-5 m'and a shear modulus of 2.50x1010 N/m2.
