Iron ore slime The iron ore washing plants generate slime on an average of 10-20% by weight of the ore and is wasted. About 12 million tonnes of iron ore slimes are generated in India every year analysing 50-60% Fe. Apart from loss of resource, these slimes pose problem of disposal and consequent damage to environment. Attempts. Learn More

## A short review on environmental impacts and application of iron ore 
Air pollution. The main source of air pollution at the mining sites is due to the dust generated by extremely small sized particle of IOT, which mixes with the air during dry weathers. Though mining companies try to pool water on the dry IOT to avoid dust, but it is not very effective in reducing air pollution.

##  Impact of leaching from iron ore mines on terrestrial and aquatic 
generated from mining activities constitute a potential risk to the environment through leaching of potentially toxic elements hosted by a variety of minerals present in the mine- waste materials (2). Contamination of water due to leachate from OB results in water pollution, which is reported in literature (3,4).

## impacts of iron ore on the environment
Assessment of Environmental Impact of Iron Ore .However, mining of iron ore has copious negative impacts on the environment. As the mining method for Iron is usually open cast, it degrades natural landscapes, surface and ground water, flora and fauna, as well as the ambient air quality within the mining area and its environs.
