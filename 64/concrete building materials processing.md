The right selection of building materials plays an important role when designing a building to fall within the definition of sustainable development. One of the most commonly used construction materials is concrete. Its production causes a high energy burden on the environment. Concrete is susceptible to external factors. As a result, cracks occur in the material. Achieving its durability

The annual construction input inflation rate came in at 19.6% for the year 2021. That is astounding. To put that metric in perspective, the nonresidential construction inflation rate was 4.4% in 2020 and 1.8% in 2019, an inflation rate that most contractors are more familiar with.. It's something to keep in mind if you are building a home - or really anything - this year.

The utilization of FRC has grown in relevance recently due to its enhanced mechanical qualities over normal concrete. Due to increased environmental degradation in recent years, natural fibres were developed and research is underway with the goal of

Concrete production creates fewer CO 2 emissions than other building materials do. Its long lifespan means it doesn't need to be replaced often, and it can be recycled to create new concrete when it does break down. It's an Energy Efficient Building Material; Compared to other building products, concrete has a high thermal mass.

## 4 Concrete Processing - The National Academies Press
The committee concludes that the following issues should be taken into consideration when examining potential nonconventional concrete processes: (1) processing requirements that correspond to new material developments; (2) processing and constructability constraints that influence the success of a construction material; (3) scale-up
