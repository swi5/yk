Environmental hazards are present during every step of the open-pit mining process. Hardrock mining exposes rock that has lain unexposed for geological eras. When crushed, these rocks expose radioactive elements, asbestos-like minerals, and metallic dust. During separation, residual rock slurries, which are mixtures of pulverized rock and

## Differences between underground mining and open pit mining
What is open pit mining. On the other hand, open-pit mining is the most common mining and ranges from very low-priced minerals to finely disseminated gold deposits. Among the low-priced ones we find clay quarries for the manufacture of bricks quarries for the exploitation of construction aggregates (gravel, sands), quarries for the extraction

## Winning a battle but not the war against open-pit mining
Catholic bishops in the Philippines have long fought against open-pit mining — a surface method of extracting rock or minerals from an open-air pit otherwise known as a "borrow" mine or a "quarry.". Holes are drilled to check if rocks or soil contain minerals. If minerals such as gold or copper are found, surface soil would be removed
