## Bauxite Mining | The Australian Aluminium Council
The first step in producing aluminium is mining this ore. Bauxite occurs mainly in tropical and sub-tropical areas, like Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Australia. Australia is the largest producer of bauxite, with five large mines supplying around 30 per cent of global production. Bauxite mining has five steps:

## Mining and Refining - Process - World Aluminium
Bauxite is generally extracted by open cast mining, being almost always found near the surface, with processes that vary slightly depending on the location. Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and/or saplings, for inclusion in a seedbank, which

## Bauxite
Bauxite ore contains 30-60% aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3). In the Bayer process (Figure 2), the bauxite is digested in a pressure vessel along with a sodium hydroxide solution (caustic soda) at an elevated temperature, which dissolves the aluminum oxide converting it into sodium aluminate, leaving insoluble red mud solids as a by-product. The alumina is extracted from the bauxite by means of the
