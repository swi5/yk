## fine grinding gold
The gold in refractory gold ores is usually wrapped in sulfide minerals in the form of fine particles. It is difficult to dissociate the gold monomer by the usual fine grinding (p80 = 53-75um). In the process of gold leaching, the leaching agent can not contact with gold, resulting in low recovery rate of gold and no economic value.
