## What is the crushing process? - MEKA
Crushing is the process of size reduction of ore. Size reduction process begins with usage of explosives at the area for production of ore. In later stages, the size reduction process performed with crushers before grinding in mills is called "crushing". Although there is no limit set, the downsizing process over 3 mm is considered as "crushing

Table Source: Wikipedia (Crushers) Cone crushers use a spinning cone that gyrates in the bowl in an eccentric motion to crush the rock between the cone surface, referred to as the mantle, and the crusher bowl liner.Gyratory crushers are very similar to cone crushers, but have a steeper cone slope and a concave bowl surface. As the gap between the bowl liner and the mantle narrows, the rock is
