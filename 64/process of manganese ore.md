## Manganese
This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150 and 250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe 2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio.

Manganese removes oxygen and sulfur when iron ore (an iron and oxygen compound) is converted into iron. It also is an essential alloy that helps convert iron into steel. As an alloy, it decreases the brittleness of steel and imparts strength. The amount of manganese used per ton of steel is rather small, ranging from 6 to 9 kilograms.

Sep 5, 2022Weathered manganese oxide ores often contain a large amount of slime, and the beneficiation adopts the method of washing and gravity separation. The raw ore is first washed to remove the mud. Some

## Manganese Mineral, Manganese Extraction, Manganese Mining Process - Xinhai
【Case】 Case 1. A manganese ore project of Xinhai, its main ore is Rhodochrosite and Ca rhodochrosite, then Calcite. Gangue including quartz, chalcedony, carbonaceous and clay, etc. Xinhai contracts the whole designation of the mineral production line, and adopts the process of rough separate the high-intensity magnetic ore and concentrate the medium intensity magnetic ore, which guarantee

## Manganese Ore Processing and Equipment - Prominer (Shanghai) Mining 
The process of processing manganese oxide ore is generally crushing the ore to 6-0mm or 10-0mm, and then classifying, coarse grade particles are sent to jig sorting, and fine grade particles are sent to shaker for sorting. 3. Strong Magnetic Separation Method. Manganese mineral is a weak magnetic mineral (specific magnetic susceptibility
