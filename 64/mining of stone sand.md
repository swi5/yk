Techniques of surface mining include: open-pit mining, which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground; quarrying, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay; strip mining, which consists of stripping surface layers off to reveal ore underneath; and mountaintop removal, commonly associated with

## The global mining of sand and gravel is unsustainable. That needn't be so
In places such as India, for example, the mining of sand has been linked with local conflicts over access to water and water pollution. At the same time, the extraction of sand, gravel and crushed stone provides jobs for millions of people and supplies materials for the renewable energy sector as well as roads and other infrastructure.

Crushed stone is an angular form of construction aggregate, made by breaking quarried rock into fragments that may be sorted, sized, and recombined into a variety of products. Crushed stone is typically quarried—that is, mined using benching methods (carrying out work from a ledge in a mine or quarry) and explosives, as opposed to the mechanical digging used for extracting sand and gravel

## 'Over excavation of sand pose a serious environmental challenge'
In recent years in India, sand mining has becomemore widespread and mechanised. The concept of seasonal sand mining is vanishing and mining activities go on in almost every season.Many riverbeds and streambeds are completely denuded of sand, prompting construction companies to look for alternatives to sand such as stone powder.

Nonmetallic mining is the extraction of stone, sand, rock or similar materials from natural deposits. The most common examples of nonmetallic mines are quarries and pits. Nonmetallic mining is a widespread activity in Wisconsin. The variety of geologic environments support a diverse industry. An estimated 2,500 mines provide:

Cobblestone is a common block, obtained from mining stone. It is mainly used for crafting or as a building block. Cobblestone can be mined using a pickaxe, in which case it drops itself.
