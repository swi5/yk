## Phosphorite
Phosphorite, phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a non-detrital sedimentary rock that contains high amounts of phosphate minerals.The phosphate content of phosphorite (or grade of phosphate rock) varies greatly, from 4% to 20% phosphorus pentoxide (P 2 O 5).Marketed phosphate rock is enriched ("beneficiated") to at least 28%, often more than 30% P 2 O 5.This occurs through washing, screening

ronments and alternative mining methods will also be developed and used. The utilization of underground mining methods may become attractive in many countries if the price of phosphate rock is high enough. Vertical integration of phosphate rock mining and processing has occurred at numerous sites around the world over the past few decades.

phosphorite, also called phosphate rock, rock with a high concentration of phosphates in nodular or compact masses. The phosphates may be derived from a variety of sources, including marine invertebrates that secrete shells of calcium phosphate, and the bones and excrement of vertebrates. The thickest deposits of phosphorite form in areas characterized by carbonaceous shale and chert.

## Where are phosphorite deposits found?
These are mined in Brazil, Canada, Finland, Russia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Phosphate rock is mined mostly by surface methods using draglines and bucket wheel excavators for large deposits and power shovels or earthmovers for smaller deposits. Underground mines use the room-and-pillar method, similar to coal mining.
