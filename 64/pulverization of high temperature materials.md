## The Most Useful Metals For High-Temperature Applications
High-temperature resistance metals are designed for applications where temperature is sufficient to melt regular-grade materials. Almost all metals that are able to withstand temperatures of 500℃ and above are high-temperature alloys. These materials are a combination of metals and additional elements that are selected for specific property traits, which in this case is heat resistance.

## Method and apparatus for shear pulverization of polymer materials 
With the application of pressure, shear, and temperature at optimum proportion, the total amount of solid polymer can be successfully converted into material of high dispersity. The first process based on Bridgmen's Effect for pulverization of virgin polymers was Solid State Shear Extrusion (SSSE).

## Chemothermal pulverization: Crushing titanate crystals to obtain 
JACerS is a leading source for top-quality basic science research and modeling spanning the diverse field of ceramic and glass materials science. Abstract In this study, we investigated chemothermal pulverization (CTP) phenomena that are induced in titanate single crystals and ceramics by high-temperature treatment at approximately 1000℃ und
