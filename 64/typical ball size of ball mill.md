A ball diameter that grabs the particle must exceed the particle by 25 times to achieve this semi-self locking taper. One can argue the f50 is a more realistic value since balls wear and the average ball size might be closer to half the maximum. Then the multiple would be closer to 13 times the maximum particle size fed to the ball mill.
