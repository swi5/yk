For the month, see Calendar. Hematite is an ore of iron, a mid-value metal useful for weapons, armor, and steel production. Hematite is found as veins in sedimentary and igneous extrusive layers, and is notable as the only source of iron available outside of sedimentary layers. Hematite can be smelted by a dwarf with the furnace operating labor

## Kinetics of hematite to magnetite transformation by gaseous reduction 
Hence, processing the low-grade hematite ore becomes extremely important for the metallurgical industry. The transformation of weakly magnetic hematite into magnetite can enhance the efficiency of magnetic separation. In this work, chemical reduction of hematite to magnetite in an atmosphere with different gas composition was investigated.

1 Answer. Sorted by: 0. The magnetic haematite beads commonly sold as being good for you in some ill defined way are actually a mixture of haematite and magnetite. The magnetic field is generated by the magnetite. At room temperature haematite is weakly ferromagnetic but not enough to be easily noticeable. It is only paramagnetic above 948K.

## When smelting iron ore?f
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red.
