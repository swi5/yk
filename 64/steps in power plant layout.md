The types of Plant Layout are the main three; process, product, and stationary layout, but in the modern world two extra types; combination and Fixed position Layout. All the facilities like equipment, raw materials, machinery, tools, futures, workers, etc. give a proper place. Here is explain the what is plant layout in operations management.

Working of Wind Power Plant. Blades of the wind turbine work as an airfoil of different cross-sections all along the length. When fluid (air) moves over this airfoil it generates a lift force thus making the blade to rotate at its axis. The generator is also connected to the rotor shaft starts rotating and produces electricity.

## Design Engineering for Power Plant Generation Systems
Load analysis is one of the most important engineering steps for increasing energy efficiency. Gathering information and data about all the loads that the power system will encounter is the first step towards design. This means understanding critical loads, duty cycle, seasonal variations, and startup requirements.
