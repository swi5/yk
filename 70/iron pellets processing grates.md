## Process Description Of Iron Ore Pellet Plant
The Chinese company has already supplied 8 pellet plants in India. In the grate kiln process, a chain grate system is used for drying pre-heating the green balls to be fed into the rotary kiln, where they are indurated. The pellets are finally cooled in a circular cooler. Iron ore pellets are being increasingly favoured in modern blast furnaces.

In the traveling-grate process, pellets are charged at one end and dried, preheated, fired, and cooled as they are carried through successive sections of the equipment before exiting at the other end. Traveling grates and grate-kilns have similar capacities, and up to five million tons of pellets can be made in one unit annually.

Iron ore is one of the two essential inputs for producing direct reduced iron (DRI); the other being natural gas or another hydrocarbon fuel that can be reformed to create a reducing gas rich in CO and H2. Although direct reduction processes can operate with pellets having an iron content of 65% or lower, typical of blast furnace (BF)-grade
