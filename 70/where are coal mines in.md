## 2 big US coal companies combine Wyoming, Colorado operations
Two of the world's largest coal producers have announced a plan to combine their mining operations in Wyoming and Colorado in a bid to improve their competitiveness against growing natural gas and renewable energy sources. Arch Coal and Peabody Energy, both based in St. Louis on Wednesday, June 19, 2019, announced the joint venture.

## Coal mining - World Coal Association
The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures, health and safety standards and worker education and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.

Many more perished from occupational diseases, but weren't tallied in official statistics. Miners were crushed to death in roof collapses, killed by gas explosions and by machinery, and more.

## West Virginia Coal Mine Disasters - Legends of America
The Eccles mine disaster was an explosion of coal-seam methane on April 28, 1914, in Eccles, West Virginia. The explosion took the lives of at least 180 men and boys. Coal mining in West Virginia has always been a risky profession, especially before 1920, when laws had not been created to improve and monitor mine safety.

## Coal mining
A coal mine in Frameries, Belgium. Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production.

It merged with the mine Bobrek in 1997. In 1999, it went through some more changes and the Mining Plant Bytom II was created. After 2005, the mine was closed with most of it being destroyed or demolished.

Coal mining began in Ohio during the 1810s and 1820s. Most of Ohio's coal mines existed in eastern and southern parts of the state. Prior to the 1810s, most Ohioans heated their homes or operated their machinery with firewood. As Ohioans cleared the land to farm it, an abundance of firewood resulted, reducing the need for coal.
