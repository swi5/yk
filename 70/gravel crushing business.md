Sand and gravel are naturally occurring materials shaped by the water in which it is formed and transported. Erosion and weathering render the stone round instead of angular. This shape is the principle difference between crushed stone and sand and gravel. About 44% of construction sand and gravel is used as concrete aggregates, 25% for road.
