Crushing is typically a dry operation that is performed in two- or three-stages (i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary crushing). Lumps of run-of-mine ore as large as 1.5 m across are reduced in the primary crushing stage to 10-20 cm in heavy-duty machines. In most operations, the primary crushing schedule is the same as the mining schedule.
