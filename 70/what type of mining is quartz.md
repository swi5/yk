Description: Quartz is the most abundant mineral. It is an essential component of granitic igneous rocks, of sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and chert and of metamorphic rocks such as quartzites. It is a common hydrothermal mineral and forms in amygdules in volcanic rock, sometimes in the form of Lake Superior agate.

Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.

Longwall mining. Longwall mining is a type of caving, applied to a horizontal tabular deposit such as coal. While block and sublevel caving are essentially vertically advancing metal mining methods, longwall mining is applied to relatively thin and flat-lying deposits - most often coal, but occasionally an industrial mineral such as trona.

Quartz is one of the most important rock-forming minerals of the Earth's crust and is an important industrial raw material (Götze et al. 2017).Naturally occurring high-purity quartz is in increasing demand due to emerging applications in the production of high-tech components such as optical fibers, halogen lamps, silica glass crucibles, computer chips, and solar panels (Müller et al. 2015).

## Types of Gemstone Mining Methods - Gemstone Buzz
Pit mining is the term used to describe a mining method where pits are dig up to about 12 meters. Open cast mining operations are generally initiated by pit mining. Terrace mining is the term used to describe a mining method where the gem bearing rocks are exposed by digging horizontal terraces in step-like, generally circular formations

## What is special about quartz?f
Quartz is important for the Critical Zone because of its composition and distribution. Quartz is the second most common mineral in the Earth's crust, right after feldspars. Because quartz is resistant to weathering, it often is one of the last minerals to dissolve. What is an interesting fact about quartz? Quartz rates high on the mohs scale
