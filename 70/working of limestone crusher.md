Jan 28, 2021The hammer crusher mainly relies on impact energy to complete the crushing of materials. When the hammer crusher is working, the motor drives the rotor to rotate at a high speed, and the material enters the crusher cavity evenly. The high-speed rotating hammer impacts, shears and tears the material and causes the material to be broken.
