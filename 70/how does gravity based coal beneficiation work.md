## How Does Gravity Work - Science in Your Life
Gravity works by using Gluons. Gluons create quantum gravity by interacting with quarks. Therefore, matter must have quarks in order to have a force of gravity and all Baryonic matter have quarks. Thus, all other fundamental particles lack gravity. Electrons, neutrinos, and photons can have mass but not gravity.
