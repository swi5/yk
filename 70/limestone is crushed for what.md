## What Happens When Limestone Is Mixed With Water? - Yes Dirt
Limestone is mostly made of calcium carbonate, with very low solubility in boiling water. If the limestone were crushed into a fine powder, it would dissolve because more surface area would be exposed to the hot water. If you put a piece of limestone (calcium carbonate) in hot water, it will dissolve similarly and dissolve in boiling water.
