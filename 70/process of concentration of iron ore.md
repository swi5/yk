## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview - IntechOpen
The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years, owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries. However, the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low-grade iron ore has been processed. The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.

## Concentration of Ores | eMedicalPrep
Bauxite is an ore of aluminum. It contains silicon dioxide, iron oxides and titanium oxide. Concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide at a pressure of 473 - 523 K and 35 - 36 bar is used for concentrating the ore. During this process, bauxite is leached out as sodium aluminate, leaving other impurities:

## Concentration of Ore - Definition, Methods of Separation, Examples 
Nov 28, 2021The concentration of ore, also known as ore enrichment, is the process of removing gangue particles from ore in order to enhance the percentage of metal in the ore. The difference in physical or chemical properties of the ore and the impurities determines the procedures used to remove impurities from the ores.
