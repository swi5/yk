2. 2 Magnetic separation. Manganese ore is mostly weakly magnetic. The specific magnetization coefficient of the manganese ore is up to 250×10 - 6cm 3 /g, the tungsten manganese iron ore is 66×10 - 6 cm 3 /g, and the manganese carbonate ore is 125×10 - 6 cm 3 /g. Most of the gangue minerals are aluminosilicates, which are non-magnetic.

## 5 Important Iron Ore Beneficiation Process Introduction
Mar 22, 2022Non-magnetic or weakly magnetic. Limonite Ore. Beneficiation process. Limonite can be used as iron ore when it is enriched in a large amount. The cut-off grade is more than 25%, and the industrial grade is more than 30%. There are usually 7 limonite beneficiation methods: (1) Severe mud, using magnetization roasting-weak magnetic separation
