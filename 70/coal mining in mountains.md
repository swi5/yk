It is without doubt that mountain top coal mining is safer for humans than sending people into tunnels to dig it out with machines, however environmentalists warn us about shaving off mountain tops to get the coal out.

Mountaintop removal is a radical form of strip mining used in the Appalachian mountain communities that is just as it sounds - the top of mountains are removed in order to get at the thin horizontal seams of coal that lie beneath. Sometimes several seams of coal may be removed, requiring more of the mountain to be destroyed with each seam.

## Mountaintop removal mining
Mountaintop removal mining (MTR), also known as mountaintop mining (MTM), is a form of surface mining at the summit or summit ridge of a mountain. Coal seams are extracted from a mountain by removing the land, or overburden, above the seams.This process is considered to be safer compared to underground mining because the coal seams are accessed from above instead of underground.
