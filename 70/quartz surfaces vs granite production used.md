Granite is a naturally occurring stone. The slabs needed for granite countertops are: Mined from quarries. Cut down to a manageable size. Polished to the finish of your choice. Quartz is also naturally occurring, but quartz countertops are made from "engineered stone", which is crushed quartz that's pigmented and bound by a polymer resin.
