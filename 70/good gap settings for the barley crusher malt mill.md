First, loosen the two screws on the back of the mill with a phillips head screwdriver. It will only take about a quarter turn on these screws to free the rollers. After loosening the screws, just turn the knobs on either side of the mill to adjust each side of the roller gap. Put the feeler gauge into the gap as you adjust the knobs.

I milled both sets of grain consecutively, starting with the coarse grist, running it through my 2-roller mill with a gap setting of 0.039 inches (1 mm), which cracks the hull and exposes the starch without completely demolishing the grain. This is a common default setting for many popular homebrew mills.

Try tightening your gap, don't worry about how your crush looks relative to your old corona mill. I have used a barley crusher for about 4 years. I tightened mine up from the factory setting to about .032". It worked great and gave me great efficiency (80-85%) for about three years and has been slowly wearing out over the last year or so.

Re: the solder strip. That's a pretty good idea! UPDATE: So we adjusted the mill to a couple different settings that looked in the range, then compared the grind side by side using both Gambrinus ESB and GW Pale Ale malt. Found one that looked best overall on visual inspection and used it. Got 85% efficiency on a 1.078 (19 plato) wort.
