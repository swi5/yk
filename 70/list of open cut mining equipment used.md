## Digging deeper: Mining methods explained | Anglo American
Open-pit is one of the most common mining methods used and starts from the earth's surface, maintaining exposure to the surface throughout the extraction period. The excavation usually has stepped sides to ensure the safety of the miners and a wide ramp where equipment can travel, allowing the product to be removed efficiently from the site.

The openings made in the process of extracting ore are called stopes or rooms. There are two steps involved in stoping. The first is developmentâ€”that is, preparing the ore blocks for miningâ€”and the second is production, or stoping, itself. Ore development is generally much more expensive on a per-ton basis than stoping, so that every effort

What are the advantages of open cast mining? Advantages of open-pit mining include: Powerful trucks and shovels can be used to move large volumes of rock. Equipment not restricted by the size of the opening you are working in. Faster production. Lower cost to mine means lower grades of ore are economic to mine.
