## gold ore mining and processing ways
 · gold processing - gold processing - Mining and concentrating: The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified.

Step #6 - Mining samples and determining processing. Once mining gets underway, samples must be taken to determine the precise metallurgical qualities of the ore. This is done in order to determine the appropriate processing technique. Step #7 - Processing (on-site) Once ore is extracted, processing it into pure gold must be done.

What is the purpose of processing ore? Mineral processing, art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock, or gangue. It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.

Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by
