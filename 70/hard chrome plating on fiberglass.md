## Hard Chrome disadvantages? | 1911Forum
First, the thickness of hard chrome plating is more like .0003/.0005. Second, hard Chrome really isn't any brighter than nickel is, the brightness depends on the preparation of the part being plated (polished, bead-blasted, brushed, etc.). Third, hard chrome will reduce metal-on-metal friction compared to unplated steel parts, not increase it.

## Plating Functional Hard Chrome - Pioneer Metal Finishing
Industrial hard chrome plating is not always a simple process. A large amount of electrical current needs to be applied to the part for the plating process to occur. Directing that current and chrome to the right places and in the correct amounts takes talent, experience and a lot of know-how. That is the heart and soul of our operations.

## Hard Chrome vs. Electroless Nickel Plating: Overview and Differences
Hardness is the key difference between hard chrome and electroless nickel-plated. The hard chromium plating is harder than the electroless nickel plating technique, but both electroless nickel and hard chrome protect the components from wear and tear. A low amount of phosphorous coating provides the hardest coating and desired thickness.

## Chrome plating
Chrome plating (less commonly chromium plating) is a technique of electroplating a thin layer of chromium onto a metal object. A chrome-plated item is called chrome.The chromed layer can be decorative, provide corrosion resistance, ease of cleaning, or increase surface hardness. Sometimes, a less expensive imitator of chrome may be used for aesthetic purposes.

Chromium is a hard, brittle, tensile-stressed metal that has good corrosion resistance to most materials. As it builds in thickness it develops a pattern of tiny cracks because the stresses become greater than the strength of the coating. These cracks form a pattern which Interlaces and sometimes extends to the base metal.
