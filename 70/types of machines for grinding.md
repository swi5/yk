## Grinding Machines: Types and Selection Principles - Mining-pedia
Grinding machine has been widely used in gold mines in South Africa since 1905. At that time, the grinding machine used river pebble as the grinding medium, which was essentially a gravel mill. Later, in order to improve the production capacity of the mill, cast iron balls were used as the medium, so normal gravel mills were evolved into ball mills and rod mills.
