Bauxite extraction is highly damaging to the environment, despite assurances to the contrary by the Ghanaian government. Reaching the metal requires strip-mining the topsoil, which in turn requires the removal of forest cover. Deforestation increased by 60 percent from 2017 to 2018 in preparation for Ghana's first bauxite mine.

## The Geology Of The Bauxite Deposits Of Ghana - OneMine
The Republic of Ghana, located on the West Coast of Africa, is one of the West African countries rich in bauxite deposits. The main occurrences of bauxite deposits are at Sefwi Bekwai in the Western Region, Aya-Nyinahin in the Ashanti Region, Atewa Range near Kibi and at Mount Ejuanema both in the Eastern Region of Ghana.

## Major manufacturing companies oppose mining in Atewa Forest, Ghana 
In late 2016, the Ghanaian government initiated plans to mine bauxite found beneath Atewa Forest as part of a financial deal with China. Extracting bauxite in Atewa would require 'strip mining' where the whole surface layer of soil is removed. This means a total loss of the forest in the mined areas, along with all the biodiversity it contains.
