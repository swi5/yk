## Gravity Concentration of Ilmenite - Shaking Table
Recovery is defined by the percentage of valuable minerals in the ore which is recovered by metallurgical methods. For example, a mining com- pany has 1000 tons of copper ore and it has 1% copper minerals. Recovery rate is 80%. In this case, amount of copper which can be recovered is 10000.010.8 = 8 tons.

Concentration means increasing the amount of gold in ore or sediment, by selectively removing lighter particles. If employed effectively, concentration methods can eliminate or greatly reduce the need for mercury. Before concentration can begin, ore must be crushed or milled to liberate gold particles from rock and to decrease grain size.

## (PDF) A Review of the Flotation of Copper Minerals - ResearchGate
The recovery of these copper minerals by flotation or hydrometallurgy from ores, typically containing 0.5%TCu (open pit mines) and 1-2%TCu (underground mines) is of great commercial importance

## Concentration of Ore - Biology Reader
The concentration of ore is a method of eliminating gangue particles or other impurities. Ore-dressing and benefaction are the alternative names for the term concentration of ore. To obtain a pure metal from ore, the method of ore concentration is a very crucial step.  It is also called "Gravity separation" or
