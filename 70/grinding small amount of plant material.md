## Small Pilot Plant Grinding Mill - 911Metallurgist
The 911MPEPPGR426 is a small 300 kilo to 3.5 ton per 24 hour day capacity grinding mill acting primarily as a rod mill but can effortlessly be converted to a ball mill. Thanks to the integrated spiral classifier, it forms an easy to operate closed-circuit grinding plant. It includes a fine ore hopper, vibrating feeder and starter rod load. It is the perfect small grinding circuit for pilot

Grinding media contain balls of different sizes in designed proportions with large sizes in feed end and small sizes in discharge end. About 27 to 35 % volume of mill is filled with grinding media. Equilibrium charge is that charge where compensation for wear can be done by balls of one size only usually the largest size in the compartment.

The most popular plant crops used for protein extraction are varieties of pulses and beans that contain between 20-35% protein. Various extraction methods will concentrate this protein to 50% or better where more specialized techniques can isolate the protein to as high as 90%. Concentration levels are determined by weight on a dry basis.
