## Copper_extraction_techniques
Pyrometallurgical extraction. The following is a process of copper extraction from chalcopyrite ore into pure metal. While oxide ores can be processed using pyrometallurgical techniques, hydrometallurgical methods are more cost effective. The copper ore is crushed and ground before it is concentrated to between 20 and 40% copper in a flotation

## Refining platinumthoidaifo
Platinum group metals (PGM) are refined using highly sophisticated chemical methods that are particular to their composition. The use of the right compounds, as well as the chemical reactions that occur, makes it easier to separate PGM from other elements that may be attached. Refining is the process of purifying an impure metal in metallurgy.

## Copper Production: How Is Copper Made? - ThoughtCo
The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.

## copper refining techniques
The refining techniques employed by copper producers depend on the ore type, as well as other economic and environmental factors. Currently, about 80 percent of global copper production is extracted from sulfide sources. Get Price Refining techniques for metal YouTube. Refining techniques for metal. Get Price
