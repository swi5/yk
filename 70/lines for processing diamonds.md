## How Are Diamonds Mined And Extracted From the Ground
Alluvial mining involves the building of walls and the diversion of rivers. Once the water is emptied out and prevented from flowing into the area of interest, bulldozers are then used to exploit the ground of the riverbank. Usually, kimberlite ore can be found in depths of at least 15 meters. When the diamond-rich depth is reached, the raw

## How Are Lab-Grown Diamonds Made? | Ritani
The HPHT method is the original method of creating lab-grown diamonds. During HPHT, diamonds are made in a lab by replicating the high-pressure, high-temperature conditions that form diamonds underground in the Earth. Gem quality HPHT diamonds were introduced in the 1950s. Outside of growing diamonds, the HPHT process can also be used to

Renewable energy used to make the lab-created diamonds. Our lab-created diamonds are grown, cut and polished using 100% renewable energy. As a result, a finished Pandora lab-created diamond has roughly 8.17 kg of carbon emissions per cut and polished carat. This means its carbon footprint is 95% lower than that of a mined diamond of the same size.
