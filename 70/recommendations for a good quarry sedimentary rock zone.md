## Sedimentary rock - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Sedimentary rocks are rocks formed from sediment.They are deposited over time, and often show layers which can be seen in cliffs.Other types of rock are igneous rock and metamorphic rock.. Sediments are usually formed from matter which falls to the bottom of oceans and lakes.The matter includes tiny pieces of other rocks, and dead animals, plants and microorganisms.

## cementation | sedimentary rock | Britannica
cementation, in geology, hardening and welding of clastic sediments (those formed from preexisting rock fragments) by the precipitation of mineral matter in the pore spaces. It is the last stage in the formation of a sedimentary rock. The cement forms an integral and important part of the rock, and its precipitation affects the porosity and permeability of the rock.

All of the stones used for building are formed by three different processes. These are: Igneious - formed from molten rock. Metamorphic - formed by the chemical and physical alteration of existing rock. Sedimentary - formed by the deposition and cementation of sediment.
