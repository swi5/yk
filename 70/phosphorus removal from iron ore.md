## Roasting-induced phase change and its influence on phosphorus removal 
In the present study, roasting-induced phase change and its influence on phosphorus removal via leaching has been investigated for high-phosphorus iron ore. The findings indicate that phosphorus in the ore is associated with goethite and exists mainly in amorphous Fe3PO7 phase. The phosphorus remains in the amorphous phase after being roasted below 300°C. Grattarolaite (Fe3PO7) is found in

## Removal of Phosphorous from Australian Iron Ores - AusIMM
Phosphorous is typically present in iron ore either in the mineral apatite, Ca5(PO4)3OH, or associated with the goethitic fraction of the ore. In this paper, we present results that show that phosphorous associated with the goethitic fraction can be removed with a heating pretreatment around 300C for 1 h, followed by a caustic leach with 1 - 5 M NaOH, or a leach with sulfuric acid at pH 0.5.
