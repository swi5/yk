## USB2 - Apparatus and method for dry beneficiation of coal 
A method of beneficiating coal in a dry process includes separating raw coal from a coal mine into coal fines and larger pieces of coal using pressurized air, separating the larger pieces of coal according to size, removing ash from the larger pieces of coal on an air table, and further removing ash from the larger pieces of coal using a size-discriminating device to obtain a beneficiated coal

Abstract— Ash and slag waste (ASW) from coal-fired thermal power plants (TPPs), the amounts of which make several tens or even hundreds of millions of tons per annum, require allocation of large land areas for storing them. This waste is a source of pollution emitted into the atmosphere and it poisons the aqueous medium and soil. Ash and slag waste consists primarily of powderlike material

Coal is a great source of energy gifted by the nature. Main hazard in the use of coal is the production of sulphur oxides, sulphur dioxides, and nitrogen oxides which affect the climate severely. To protect environment from these hazardous oxides of sulphur, clean coal technology is being introduced and applied all over the world.

Coal Beneficiation Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both. Two basic processes of beneficiation: - Dry-deshaling: Non-coal or shaly-coal is removed without using any liquid media.

##  Dewatering and Drying of Fine Coal to a Saleable Product - WRC
The history of coal preparation has been the cleaning of successively finer fractions of the run of mine feed. Coarse coal has been washed alone for many years, with the duff being sold as a raw product. Indeed, even now destoning plants are used in some cases to produce coal for Eskom power stations. The coal industry has seen and continues to see

##  Thermo-adhesive Separation: a Novel Dry Coal Beneficiation Technique
Beneciation of coal (separation of ash minerals from coal) is generally achieved using the water-based processes. Most of the preparation plants utilizes gravity-based processes, such as jigs, heavy media vessels, cyclones, spirals, etc., for particles down to a size of 28 mesh (0.6 mm). The ner size

COAL BENEFICIATION DRY METHODS Rick Honaker, University of Kentucky Gerald (Jerry) Luttrell, Virginia Tech U.S.-India 6th Coal Working Group Meeting L'Enfant Plaza Hotel  • Added advantage of dry coal cleaning. Note that emissions climb rapidly >55-60% ash. • Also tend to be high in trace elements (Hg), particulates, etc.
