Bayer process. The Bayer process is the principal industrial means of refining bauxite to produce alumina (aluminium oxide) and was developed by Carl Josef Bayer.Bauxite, the most important ore of aluminium, contains only 30-60% aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3), the rest being a mixture of silica, various iron oxides, and titanium dioxide.

Step 4- Digestion process. In the digestion process, the slurry is heated to 270℃ to form a sodium aluminate supersaturated solution or "pregnant liquor". A hot caustic soda (NaOH) solution can dissolve the aluminium-bearing minerals in the bauxite. There are two types of bauxite: gibbsite, böhmite and diaspore.
