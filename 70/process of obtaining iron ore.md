## Process of Steel-making from Iron Ore
Process of Steel-making from Iron Ore. Steel is an alloy consisting mainly of iron, carbon and other elements. According to its carbon content, iron can be divided into pig iron and wrought iron. Pig iron contains between 2.11 and 4.5 percent carbon, wrought iron less than 0.0218 percent and steel between (0.0218 and 2.11 percent).

## Process Of Obtaining Iron From Its Ore
The production of iron from its ore is a chemical reduction process that results in a crude iron containing many undesired impurities. Iron from a blast furnace typically contains 0.6 to 1.2 percent silicon, 0.4 to 2.0 percent manganese, and lesser amounts of phosphorus and sulfur.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## The Sintering Process of Iron Ore Fines - IspatGuru
The process of sintering is basically a pre-treatment process step during iron making for the production of the charge material called sinter for the blast furnace from iron ore fines and also from metallurgical wastes (collected dusts, sludge and mill scale etc.). The sintering technology was originally developed for the purpose of utilizing
