## Understanding comminution: Compression versus impact crushing
Jaw crushers are generally considered a primary or first stage crusher. The maximum feed size can be as large as 80%-85% of the crusher's gape or depth, while reduction ratios range from 2-3 times. Cone crushers are typically used in the secondary or tertiary stage after a jaw crusher's begun the reduction process earlier in the circuit.

An impact crusher uses mass and velocity to break down feed material. First, the feed material is reduced as it enters the crusher and makes contact with the rotating blow bars or hammers in the rotor. Secondary breakage then occurs as the material is accelerated into the stationary aprons or breaker plates.
