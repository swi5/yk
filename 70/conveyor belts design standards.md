What are slat conveyors? "Slat conveyors are a type of conveying technology that utilizes a chain-driven loop of slats to move product from one of its ends to another. The chain is driven by a motor, which causes it to cycle just as belt conveyors do. The main difference is that, instead of a rubber belt, this conveyor type uses slats
