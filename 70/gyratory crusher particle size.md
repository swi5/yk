## P&Q University Lesson 7- Crushing & Secondary Breaking
A gyratory crusher uses a mantle that gyrates, or rotates, within a concave bowl. As the mantle makes contact with the bowl during gyration, it creates compressive force, which fractures the rock.  Simple crushing is a relatively easy process. But crushing material so that the particle size, distribution and cleanliness meet the high
