Iron oxides (10 - 30%), titanium dioxide (2 - 15%), silicon oxide (5 - 20%) and undissolved alumina (0 - 20%) make up the residue, together with

Bauxite is an aluminium ore. It is known for being the main source of aluminium in the world. Bauxite was first discovered by a French geologist called Pierre Bertheir in 1821 in Provence in the South of France in Les Baux village. The French chemist Henri Sainte-Claire Deville gave the mineral the name 'bauxite' in 1861.
