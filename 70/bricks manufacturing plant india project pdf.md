##  GUIDELINES ON BRICK MANUFACTURING UNIT
The traditional brick manufacturing needs considerable land area and top soil. The land area near the kiln is subjected to high temperature making it unfit for uses in agricultural activities after being abandoned. The brick manufacturing uses thousand of tones of coal and biomass fuel (The energy use is 30-35 % of production cost).
