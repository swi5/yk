## CNC machine bearings common quality problems and main causes.
Below we analyze the common quality problems and causes of cnc machine bearings. 1. improper installation of cnc machine bearings. 1. Use brute force during installation. Directly hitting the bearing with a hammer will cause the greatest damage to the cnc machine bearings; it is the main cause of deformation.

## Ball Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
8.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1-1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11 ). The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20-40% water by weight.
