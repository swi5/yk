The plant material from which coal is derived is composed of a complex mixture of organic compounds, including cellulose, lignin, fats, waxes, and tannins. As peat formation and coalification proceed, these compounds, which have more or less open structures, are broken down, and new compounds—primarily aromatic (benzenelike) and hydroaromatic—are produced. In vitrinite these compounds are

## What are the different types of coal? - American Geosciences Institute
The coal formation process involves the burial of peat, which is made of partly decayed plant materials, deep underground. The heat and pressure of burial alters the texture and increases the carbon content of the peat, which transforms it into coal, a type of sedimentary rock. This process takes millions of years. Types, or "ranks," of coal are determined by carbon content. There are four
