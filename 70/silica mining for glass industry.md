## How Silica Sand is Used in Glass Manufacturing | PFS Aggregates
Apr 7, 2021To be suitable for use in the production of glass, the silica must be chemically pure (contain more than 95% silicon dioxide) and be the right size (have a grain size of between 0.075mm and 1.18mm), and color. These high-level requirements mean that only sand deposits from specific sources are suitable for use in the glass industry.
