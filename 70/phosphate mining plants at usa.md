## Phosphate Mining | Sierra Club
A closer look reveals that phosphate mining is extremely harmful to our wetlands, water quality and quantity, and wildlife habitat. Phosphate mining companies own or have mineral rights to over 400,000 acres, mostly in the Peace and Myakka River watersheds, with mining projects planned for over 62,000 acres.

## Phosphate Mining - Biological Diversity
Most mining of phosphate rock involves clearing large swaths of vegetation and digging up the soil beneath to reach the phosphate-ore-containing matrix 60 to 80 feet below the surface. This matrix is then transported by pipeline to a nearby plant, where the phosphate ore is forcibly separated from the sand and clay by a process known as

## Phosphate Mining and the Paradox of Abundance - Edge Effects
Similar to other products of the plantation, widespread use of phosphate is accompanied by environmental destruction. Phosphate strip mines produce around 150 million tons of toxic spoil a year, and the ravaged exterior edges of key mining zones—marked by massive draglines, huge slurry pipes, and heaps of waste—are visible for tens of miles.

## Phosphate Mining | Trans-Phos
Locally, phosphate is popularly concentrated and mined in Central Florida, which is also called the "Bone Valley". In the process of mining, phosphate is mixed with water using high-powered water guns to create a slurry. It is then pumped to the beneficiary plant, wherein the phosphate is separated from the sand and clay.

Nine phosphate mines are currently active. Nine mines are 100 percent reclaimed and released from reclamation obligations. The remaining mines are either not started or are shut down. Phosphate mines typically range in size from approximately 5,000 to 100,000 acres. Phosphate mining disturbs between 3,000 to 6,000 acres annually in Florida.
