## Does bauxite cause cancer?tankandlift
Aluminium ore is called bauxite . The bauxite is purified to produce aluminium oxide, a white powder from which aluminium can be extracted.  This is an aluminium compound with a lower melting point than aluminium oxide. The use of cryolite reduces some of the energy costs involved in extracting aluminium.

## In the extraction of aluminium from bauxite fluorspar is added to to?
Which solvent is used in bauxite extraction? In the Bayer process, bauxite ore is heated in a pressure vessel along with a sodium hydroxide solution (caustic soda) at a temperature of 150 to 200 °C. At these temperatures, the aluminium is dissolved as sodium aluminate (primarily [Al(OH) 4] −) in an extraction process.
