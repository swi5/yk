## Dense Media Separation (DMS) Plants - JXSC Machine
Dense Media Separation. A heavy medium is a heavy-fluid or heavy suspension fluid with a density greater than that of water (1g/cm3). The process of separating ore particles in heavy media is called Dense Media Separation / Heavy Media Separation (DMS / HMS). The heavy medium separation method is an advanced gravity beneficiation method.
