## Tech giant pledges to end mining and use recycled materials
The world's second-largest smartphone maker is also looking into ways to reuse materials. For example, it melted down the aluminum enclosures on the iPhone 6 to make Mac mini computers to use in its factories and it said that it is moving to 100% recycled tin solder on the main logic board of iPhone 6s.

## Recycling and garbage collection in Switzerland | Expatica
Aug 18, 2022Recycling paper and cardboard in Switzerland. 90% of the paper acquired by Switzerland each year comes from reused waste paper. This highlights the value of recycled paper as a Swiss resource. Since paper and cardboard are some of the most widely recycled materials in Switzerland, you can easily find a public collection point or household pick-up.

## Recycling by material
Concrete recycling is the use of rubble from demolished concrete structures. Recycling is cheaper and more ecological than trucking rubble to a landfill. Crushed rubble can be used for road gravel, revetments, retaining walls, landscaping gravel, or raw material for new concrete.Large pieces can be used as bricks or slabs, or incorporated with new concrete into structures, a material called

## Are you still recycling or already repairing? | Switzerland Times
Recycling is the final stage of the circular economy, the aim of which is to use existing resources efficiently and generate as little waste as possible. It is true that Switzerland is the absolute leader when it comes to recycling household waste: a little more than half of municipal waste is collected separately and recycled.

## Recycled Materials and By-Products for Pavement Construction
Abstract. Over the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of recycled materials/by-products as alternative ecomaterials in pavement construction on widely varying estimates. This increase is due to the scarcity and depletion of the natural resources and the need of large material quantities for the construction of pavement

Beyond money, construction recycling helps preserve natural resources, including water, trees, natural gas, and other forms of energy. The more recycled materials in use, the less energy is necessary for the sourcing and production of new materials. This graphic below notes the stages of waste avoidance.
