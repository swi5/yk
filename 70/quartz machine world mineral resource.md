## Is Quartz Sustainable? An Honest Look at the Facts
Unlike granite or marble, which must be specially mined from specific locations, quartz is readily available throughout the world. In fact, it is the second most abundant mineral on the planet. Therefore, there are ample quartz supplies, and its formation is prevalent. It forms between other rock formations either underground or in open cavities.

Quartz is one of the most abundant minerals in the Earth's crust. Deposits of quartz are spread out across all continents and occur in all types of rocks, including igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. Quartz is the dominant mineral of mountain landscapes. Beaches, rivers, and deserts all contain quartz sand as one of their prominent materials.

## Quartz Mineral | Photos, Uses, Properties, Pictures - Geology
Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.

Physical processing: the physical process involves cleaning the surface of the quartz. In magnetic separation and high tension separation the minerals and quartz are separated depending on the surface charge. Chemical processing: floatation and acid leaching are the two primary processes in which the trace minerals from the quartz are removed.
