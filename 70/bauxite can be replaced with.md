## The World's Leading Bauxite Producing Countries - WorldAtlas
Bauxite is a soft limonite iron ore rock with portions of its iron composition replaced by aluminum. Bauxite forms when silica leaches out from laterite soil. Bauxite does not exhibit any particular composition instead it is just an assortment of clay minerals, aluminum hydroxides, and hydrous aluminum oxides. Although insoluble minerals are

## ARTICLE: Addressing the Challenge of Bauxite Residue
By Alton Tabereaux, Contributing Editor. The largest waste by-product generated in the Bayer bauxite refining process is bauxite residue, commonly called red mud. An enormous quantity of caustic red mud is generated worldwide every year, posing a very serious and alarming environmental and safety problem. The storage of red mud is a challenge

## Where bauxite is found in the world?
In 2009, Australia was the top producer of bauxite with almost one-third of the world's production, followed by China, Brazil, India, and Guinea.Although aluminium demand is rapidly increasing, known reserves of its bauxite ore are sufficient to meet the worldwide demands for aluminium for many centuries.

## Difference Between Bauxite and Aluminum
Unlike some metal ores, bauxite is normally in good conditions, therefore, need less processing to purify it. This bauxite is then converted to alumina by chemical processes. Aluminum can be separated from alumina by an electrolysis process (Hall process). Bauxite is used as an abrasive, for cement, chemicals, makeup and other products.

An electrical current is run through the mixture, causing the carbon from the carbon anode to attach to the oxygen component in the alumina, yielding aluminum and carbon dioxide: 2 Al2O3 + 3 C > 4 Al + 3 CO2. This process takes place at temperatures between º C and yields an aluminum of high purity.

## What is Bauxite? - Mineral, Formula, Uses with Videos and FAQs - BYJUS
Bauxite is a high-aluminium-content rock. That is the main ore that aluminium is mined from. One of the most common elements on earth is bauxite. It contains almost 25 percent-30% alumina. In the belt around the equator, bauxite is commonly found. The primary aluminium bearing ore with an aluminium content of more than 35 to 40 percent is bauxite.

## Is bauxite only used to make aluminum? - Quora
Answer: There are a large number of minerals and rocks containing aluminum; however, only a few of them can be used for extracting aluminum. Bauxites are the most widely used raw materials for aluminum. Initially a semifinished product, Alumina (Al2O3) is extracted from the ores, and the metallic

## The Electrolysis of Bauxite | S-cool, the revision website
The bauxite (red-brown solid) - aluminium oxide mixed with impurities - is extracted from the earth. The extracted aluminium oxide is then treated with alkali, to remove the impurities. This results in a white solid called aluminium oxide or alumina. The alumina is then transported to huge tanks. The tanks are lined with graphite, this acts as
