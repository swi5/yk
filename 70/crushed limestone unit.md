Second, because crushed limestone has a lighter unit weight than gravel, it will require about 12% less crushed limestone than gravel to mix a cubic yard of concrete. Additionally, crushed limestone concrete is easier to saw through than gravel concrete. This is because most gravel is silica. Silica is almost impossible to cut with a steel saw
