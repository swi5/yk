## Neutralization of Acid Mine Drainage Contaminated Water and 
The unscientific mining of coal without environmental safeguards in Jaintia Hills, Meghalaya has adversely affected the water resources of the area, leading to streams with a pH of 3-5. The acidic stream water is not suitable for human use and lacks aquatic life. The prevailing situation demanded immediate neutralization and eco-restoration. Considering the need, the water of Moolawar stream

Types of Underground Mining Underground mining for coal is conducted by either room and pillar mining or longwall mining. In room and pillar mining, approximately 50 percent of the coal is removed, using a continuous miner, from areas known as rooms.

## COAL MINING AND ITS SOCIAL IMPACT IN JAINTIA HILLS
The report of 1993 (Studies of Environmental Impact of Coal Mining in Jaintia Hill District) suggest that 61% are from Nepal, about 35% from Assam and the rest from West Bengal. In spite of the poverty that was prevalent among the rural masses of the area it was also reported that very few mine labourers are from the locality itself.

## Acid drainage from coal mining: Effect on paddy soil and productivity 
In the recent past, coal mining has led to major changes in land use: most of the productive arable land has gradually been affected by the mining. In the Jaintia hills the mined land increased from 3.26% to 11.2% of the total area between 1975 and 2007, while the land under agriculture decreased from 2.65% to 1.43% (Sarma et al., 2010).
