## beneficiation process of hematite
hematite roasting beneficiation process.  Hematite and magnetite are the most prominent iron ores. Most of the high-grade hematite iron ores (direct shipping ore (DSO)) are subjected to simple dry processes of beneficiation to meet size requirements. This involves multistage crushing and screening to obtain lump (− 31.5 + 6.3 mm) and fines
