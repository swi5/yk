Here in Ireland there's a historic gold mining area were kg gold was found in rivers over the years, but after nearly 200 years of exploration not a single gold vein was found. It's possible that most of the gold bearing quartz veins have been long weathered away, leaving behind durable gold concentrated in weathered soils and streams.
