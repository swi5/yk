## Borates in Metallurgy and Gold Refinement | U.S. Borax
The borax contribution to flux composition can be up to 60% of total flux weight but is typically around 30-40%. Borates are also used to facilitate the attack of gold ore at a lower temperature and to make the slag more fluid at the furnace operating temperature, thus reducing viscosity. The benefits of Dehybor in gold refining are numerous:

Oct 25, 2021The melting point of gold is 1064ºC, so your blowtorch is inadequate. You have to melt the gold in something, and the borax acts to cover it, allowing the dense gold to settle, dissolving various metal oxides that might contaminate your flakes, and floating above the gold..
