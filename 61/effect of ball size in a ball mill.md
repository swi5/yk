An investigation was conducted to determine the effect of the ball diameter sizes on milling operation. A laboratory size ball mill was used with ball media of sizes 10 mm, 20 mm and 30 mm respectively. Quartz was the material used to perform the experiment and was arranged into 3 mono-sizes namely -8 mm +5.6 mm, -4 mm +2.8 mm and-2 mm +1.4 mm

## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering. It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical

In test 3, in which the grid was used to segregate the different sizes of balls, a further advantage of about 4 percent in efficiency is shown. The conical mill in test 4 increased the efficiency to 58 percent more than in test 1. The efficiency with the long (6-foot) conical mill was about the same as with the short (3-foot) one.

##  The Effect of Ball Size Diameter on Milling Performance
An investigation was conducted to determine the effect of the ball diameter sizes on milling operation. A laboratory size ball mill was used with ball media of sizes 10 mm, 20 mm and 30 mm respectively. Quartz was the material used to perform the experiment and was arranged into 3 mono-sizes namely -8 mm +5.6 mm, -4 mm +2.8 mm and-2 mm +1.4 mm

## How To Reduce Ball Mill
 · The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size. The large balls tend to break down the coarse feed materials and the smaller balls help to form fine product by reducing void spaces between the balls. Ball mills grind material by impact and attrition.

## Ball Size effect analysis in SAG Grinding - CEEC (Coalition for Eco 
The analysis of the influence of ball sizes in SAG grinding hasn't been developed in detail by considering the effect on process parameters inside the mill, grinding efficiency or internal classification. Historically a conventional grinding reference has been made on the empirical procedure developed by Azzaroni (1980).
