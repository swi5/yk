## Turkish Mining | Maxore Mining Inc.
Due to the low iron ore production Turkey is dependent on iron ore imports. Since Turkey has a very substantial steel industry, the iron ore imports are considerable. In 2012, Turkish iron ore imports rose by 18% and reached 7.8 million ton according to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK). The value of iron ore imports was USD 1.15 billion.

## Iron mining in the United States
Iron ore was discovered on the Marquette Range in 1844, and mining started in 1848. Mining increased after the opening of the ship canal at Sault Ste. Marie provided cheap water transportation between the iron mines to the lower Great Lakes. The Lake Superior iron deposits were the largest ever discovered in the United States, and by the late 1800s, dominated American iron mining.

## Iron Ore - Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety
Iron is the world's most commonly used metal, and iron ore is a key ingredient for steel making. To produce 1,000 kilograms of crude steel requires about 1,400 kilograms of iron ore (and around 800 kilograms of coal). Iron can be alloyed with a variety of elements to produce stronger and harder products which are useful in the construction

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
