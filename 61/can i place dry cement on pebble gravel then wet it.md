## Can anyone think of a use for old bags of concrete mix? - Houzz
rosesinny. When you break up your concrete and add water, you're not making new concrete. Concrete is not mud. When fresh out of the bag, the cement reacts with water chemically, not mechanically. It incorporates the water into a new compound and that's what makes it hard, and that's also why it's hot when the reaction is taking place and you

## Mosaic Stepping Stone Instructions | How To Mosaic Blog
1. Prefabricated Stepping Stones. You can cement tile to a plain prefabricated concrete stepping stone purchased from a lawn and garden center. 2. Stepping Stone Molds. You can press tile into wet concrete in a stepping stone mold or have a mosaic design on contact paper at the bottom of a stepping stone mold and pour concrete on top of that.
