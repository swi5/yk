## Selecting Jaw Crusher Liners | Shape & Design
I proposed this literature from Metso to help him select a jaw liner set. Designing your jaw crusher liners for the right function starts with asking 'what final product crush size distribution do I want' & 'what are the physical characteristics of the feed to that crusher'? Look at the table below to make you assessment and design decision.

These non-choking jaw plates have been developed in two styles, reversible and non-reversible. The advantage of the reversible design has been outlined in connection with its application to the gyratory reduction crusher. For both types of jaw plate, the effective receiving opening is reduced, as compared to the standard, straight-plate setup.

Jaw crushers are designed to impart an impact on a rock particle placed between a fixed and a moving plate (jaw). The faces of the plates are made of hardened steel. Both plates could be flat or the fixed plate flat and the moving plate convex. The surfaces of both plates could be plain or corrugated.
