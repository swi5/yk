## Expert Q&A: Manufactured sand - Metso Outotec
Still to call sand manufactured sand it should be purpose-made. That's the main requirement although there are of course many purposes for the product. Another way to define it is by the size distribution and the maximum size. These vary depending on the local specifications, but generally, manufactured sand's grain size is under 5mm.
