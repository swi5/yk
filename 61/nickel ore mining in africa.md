## Nickel: A Green Energy Necessity With Environmental Risks
Soaring nickel demand spurs a shift in supply. Global nickel deposits come in two types of ore, sulphides and laterites. Sulphides are higher grade and extracted using conventional techniques, while laterites are lower grade and must be extracted through more complex, open-pit mining techniques to remove large volumes of water before refining.

##  Nickel Deposits of - USGS
nickel ore deposits are closely associated with mafic and ultramafic inÂ­ trusive rocks, and the nickel in the ore bodies was probably derived either from the intrusives themselves or from similar rocks at depth. Thus the original source of most of the nickel ore bodies found in North America and elsewhere in the world was probably the mantle.

## Nickel mine
From 1953 to 1958 Nickel Rim mines operating around Sudbury, Ontario deposited their mine tailings in an impoundment near the mine. The water in the impoundment was later tested and found to have low pH and high concentrations of iron, sulphur and dissolved metals such as aluminum and nickel. This is due to the oxidation of the tailings (usually sulfide minerals like pyrrhotite).
