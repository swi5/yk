## Magnetic and Gravity Methods in Mineral Exploration: the Value of Well 
Magnetic methods are more popular in mineral exploration than gravity, not least because magnetic data can be quickly recorded from the air and in conjunction with other geophysical surveys. Land gravity surveys, by contrast, may require greater field efforts (Figs. 1, 5 and 6), more time, and more commitment of scarce capital.

## Donald B Peck - Determining the Specific Gravity of a Mineral
Recall that Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of water. The density of water varies less than 1.5 mg/cm3 over the narrow range of normal temperatures. Between 20o C and 25o C the density of water is essentially 1 g/cm3. The volume expansion of the solid mineral is insignificant.
