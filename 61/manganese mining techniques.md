## Manganese Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
More than 25 million tons of manganese are mined every year. Most manganese mining occurs in open pits. Although there are processes in place to mine manganese nodules in the ocean floor, they cannot complete with land-based mining production. Once the ore is mined, it's transferred to a processing plant for electrolytic processing or smelting.

Open-pit mining provides significant proportions of many of the world's major mineral commodities. Much of the world's annual output of copper, gold and iron ore is won from open-pit operations. Other commodities produced from open-pits include diamonds, molybdenum, manganese, lead and zinc, uranium and a variety of industrial minerals, such as borates, talc and specialist clays.

## 7 Common Manganese Mining Processes
The manganese mining process that used to deal with manganese oxide ores usually need to crush the ores into 0-6mm to 0-10mm, and then classify them. The coarse minerals are sent to jigging separation, and the fine minerals are sent to shaking table separation. 3. Strong magnetic separation process . Manganese ore belong to weak magnetic mineral (specific susceptibility X=10×10-6~600×10-6cm3

manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Manganese (Mn) is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 °C (2,271 °F). Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such as sulfur and oxygen and adds important physical properties to the metal.
