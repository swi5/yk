## Sprinkling basalt over soil could remove huge amounts of carbon dioxide 
Aug 1, 2021Costs for distributing basalt on a sufficiently large scale would include mining and crushing the rock, transport and distribution. Goll says that a cost of roughly $150 per tonne of removed carbon dioxide is realistic, assuming that basalt is applied to land reasonably close to human infrastructures using aircraft.

Basalt has a strict chemical definition. It is defined in the TAS diagram shown above. Basalt is an igneous rock that contains more than 45 and less than 52% of SiO2 and less than five percent of total alkalies (K2O + Na2O)3. Types of Basalt Basalt types: tholeiites vs alkali basalts.

## Merge dragons basalt rock leveldroll-cakeandroll
basalt, extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock that is low in silica content, dark in colour, and comparatively rich in iron and magnesium. Some basalts are quite glassy (tachylytes), and many are very fine-grained and compact. It is more usual, however, for them to exhibit porphyritic structure, with larger crystals (phenocrysts) of olivine, augite, or feldspar in a finely crystalline.

What is Basalt? Basalt is a dark-colored, fine-grained, igneous rock composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene minerals. It most commonly forms as an extrusive rock, such as a lava flow, but can also form in small intrusive bodies, such as an igneous dike or a thin sill.It has a composition similar to gabbro.The difference between basalt and gabbro is that basalt is a fine-grained rock while

Kapowsin Quarry is a basalt quarry. Unlike a granite or marble quarry, we don't cut rock into perfectly rectangular blocks. Instead, we break up rock deposits with dynamite. The rock is blown into large pieces, which are sorted by size. Most of the rock is broken down even more and crushed into pieces of many different sizes.

Back on Earth, there are lots of different kinds of basalt rock that are created in different ways. If a volcano erupts in the air, the lava tends to form frothy-textured basalts, sometimes with lava tubes inside. If it flows more thickly, and cools fast, then fractures build up and split into polygons (like at the Giant's Causeway).
