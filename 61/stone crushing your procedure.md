##  Environmental GUIDELINE ON STONE CRUSHING plant
A stone crushing plant is primarily involved in the manufacture of aggregates of various sizes (coarse aggregates, crusher run, rock sand and other fine aggregates) from basalt boulders. Coarse aggregates are usually used in ready mix concrete and asphaltic concrete. Crusher run is used for the bases and sub-bases for road making.

The crushing strength of stones varies in the range of 15-100 N/mm 2. Transverse Strength Test (IS: 1121 (Part II)): To test stone for transverse strength, specimen pieces are made in the form of blocks 200 Ã 50 Ã 50 mm. These are tested in saturated and dry conditions similar to as explained in the compressive strength test.
