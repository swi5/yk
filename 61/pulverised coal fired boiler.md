## Preparation and utilization of pulverized coal and clean coal slurries 
The particle size range of pulverized coal is usually below 150 {mu}m; most advantages and drawbacks of this fuel stem from the fact that small particles heat up rapidly,  But the ignition of coal-fired boilers stabilizing combustion under low load also need a large amount of oil. Information show that it will consume 5t for a 50MW unit

## In which state does the pulverised coal burns?
In conventional coal-fired plants coal is first pulverised into a fine powder and then combusted at temperatures of between 1300 and 1700 o C. This process heats water in tubes in the boiler so that it becomes steam at a pressure of around 180 bar and a temperature of 540 o C.

## Pulverized coal-fired boiler
A pulverized coal-fired boiler is an industrial or utility boiler that generates thermal energy by burning pulverized coal (also known as powdered coal or coal dust since it is as fine as face powder in cosmetic makeup) that is blown into the firebox.

## ﻿Coal-Fired Boiler Design Scribd
Coal-fired boilers are mainly operated at either subcritical or supercritical conditions. From a thermo-physics perspective, two phase mixtures of water and steam are replaced by a single supercritical fluid when the boiler pressure increases above the critical pressure of 22.12 MPa and the corresponding saturation temperature of 374 °C ( Shen
