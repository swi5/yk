## Sieving, Magnetic Separation - Class 6, Separation of Substances
Sieving. A sieve is a shallow vessel having small holes at its bottom. An iron mesh can also be used as a sieve in some cases. The method of separating a mixture by using sieve is called Sieving. Sieving is used to separate those solid mixtures which have components of different sizes. The mixtures having components of different sizes is put in

## Separation process
A separation process is a method that converts a mixture or a solution of chemical substances into two or more distinct product mixtures, a scientific process of distinguishing two or more substance in order to obtain purity. At least one product mixture from the separation is enriched in one or more of the source mixture's constituents. In some cases, a separation may fully divide the mixture

## How can sand and iron filings be separated? - Quora
Answer (1 of 18): To separate the iron sand mixture we can use a magnet to remove the iron fillings from the sand, because sand is not attracted to the magnet. After separation the components of athe mixture will have the same composition and properties as they did not start with.

Iron Separation Techniques. achieve separation. Today, the students will use what they know about the physical properties of iron filings, sand, cork, and salt to separate the components of a mixture and they will also learn a chromatography technique to separate the dyes in pens. Procedures: 1. Iron, Sand, Salt, Cork Separation a.
