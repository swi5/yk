## structure stability test of structures of conveyor belt
For the conveyor belt industry, there is only one standardized procedure that allows investigation of the belt's lateral bending flexibility. This procedure is described in ISO 703 (analogical testing method in ASTM D378 ) and is named the troughability test.This test was established based on practical experience and describes the belt troughability as a ratio of the maximum deflection

## Stability - Stable & Unstable Structures & Structural Members
Internal stability of truss depends upon the arrangements of members and joints as.  If m + r = 2j internally stable  If m + r < 2j internally unstable  If m + r > 2j indeterminate. Where m = number of members, J = number of joints, R = number of unknown reactions. For complete stability the should be both internally and externally stable.

The structural analysis software RFEM 6 is the basis of a modular program family. The RFEM main program is used to define structures, materials, and loads for planar and spatial structural systems consisting of plates, walls, shells, and members. The program also allows you to create combined structures as well as model solid and contact elements.

Incline Between 20 and 30-Degrees - Loss in conveying efficiency is typically between 10 and 70-percent on inclines up to 30-degrees. A screw conveyor with tubular housing and reduced pitch screw (1/2 or 2/3) is recommended for most applications. Loss in efficiency can also be overcome by increasing the speed or the diameter of the screw conveyor.

## Belt conveyor frame types and design considerations
The Belt conveyor frame is a metal structure (usually using normal and stainless steel conveyor frame) used to support idlers, pulley and belt tension. The designed structure and production material of the frame determine the quality of the frame. The actual use of the belt conveyor frames involve various forms of steel structure.

In order to install the belt roller bracket (ie truss), the belt belt machine generally adopts the frame (ie truss) in the form of Figure 1. The support is made of a garden-shaped bracket. Since the belt truss has sufficient rigidity, it can be on both sides. A sidewalk and access road are added to replace the conveyor trestle.

The diameter of the pulley must be designed such that it does not place undue stress on the belt. The length of a belt conveyor in metres is the length from the centre of pulley parallel to belt line. Belt length is dependent on both the pulley diameters and centre distances. Capacity is the product of speed and belt cross sectional area.
