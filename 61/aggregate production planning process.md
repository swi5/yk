## Aggregate production planning under uncertainty: a comprehensive 
This is the first literature survey of its kind on aggregate production planning (APP) under uncertainty. Different types of uncertainty, such as stochasticity, fuzziness and possibilistic forms, have been incorporated into many management science techniques to study APP decision problem under uncertainty.
