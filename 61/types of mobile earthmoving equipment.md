Some of them, like excavators, even use specialized hydraulic units like final drives. Bulldozers Bulldozers are powerful machines that are typically used to push earth or rocks. Some of the components they include are a blade, tracks, and a ripper. They are very heavy, so they can generate enough force to push heavy objects, including boulders.

## A Review of the Basic Types of Earthmoving Equipment
There are two main types of earthmoving equipment that anyone should familiarize themselves with. One is the backhoe while the other is the heavy equipment loader. There are benefits to using both including the fact that a backhoe can make a faster and more efficient excavation while also being able to dig into difficult to reach areas.

## The Suggested Earthmoving And Mining Equipment
There are two types of bulldozers: tracked and wheeled bulldozers. The tracked bulldozers are very powerful, extremely stable and mobile machines, thanks to their tracks. The wheeled bulldozers come with a set of rubber tires instead of tracks. Because they are equipped with tires, these bulldozers offer more maneuverability on the job site.
