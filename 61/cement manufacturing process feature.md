## Fire and Explosion Hazards in Cement Manufacturing Industries
Five fire hazards associated with the cement manufacturing process are outlined in the following sections. 1) Coal Storage. On average 0.2 - 0.3 tonnes of coal are consumed in the kiln per kilogram of clinker cement production. As such coal storage during cement manufacturing is an important component to consider in hazard analysis.

## Cement Manufacturing Process - All About Engineering
Manufacturing of cement is a very critical process because there are more than 25 types of cement. It begins with mining, grinding of material, and then passes through the kiln at 1450° C which is very high temperature and then gypsum is added with it. Cement is used in different types of concrete, but the most commonly used cement is Portland

What is the process of making cement called? Cement manufacturing is a two-stage process. Materials such as limestone that contain calcium oxide are mixed with silica and alumina materials such as sand, shale or clay. The raw materials are usually dried and ground, and then the mixture is heated in a rotary kiln to form clinker.
