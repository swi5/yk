## How to Make Glass | AAA Glass
As stated above, glass starts with what's known as quartz and/or silica sand. The first step in creating glass is mixing this quartz sand with soda ash (sodium carbonate) and limestone (calcium carbonate). Other additions can be added, depending on the end purpose or color of the glass. Heat the Compound

Quartz crystals can be cut, fined and polished into optical lenses which transmit a greater range of UV than crown glass. It is not useful for human spectacle lenses, but has scientific uses. Although glass is essentially composed of silicone oxide like quartz, glass is not crystalline. Quartz is crystalline.

Glass is usually made from three ingredients, silica, soda, and lime. Silica, or silicon dioxide, is a significant component of white sand, or you might know it as quartz. You can make glass from silica however the resulting product has a very high melting point and high viscosity, making it difficult to work with.

## What is special about quartz?f
What is the use and importance of quartz? Many varieties are gemstones, including amethyst, citrine, smoky quartz, and rose quartz.
