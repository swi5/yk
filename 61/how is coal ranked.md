## What are the different types of coal? - American Geosciences Institute
The coal formation process involves the burial of peat, which is made of partly decayed plant materials, deep underground. The heat and pressure of burial alters the texture and increases the carbon content of the peat, which transforms it into coal, a type of sedimentary rock. This process takes millions of years. Types, or "ranks," of coal are determined by carbon content. There are four

## Coal explained - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
Coal is classified into four main types, or ranks: anthracite, bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite. The ranking depends on the types and amounts of carbon the coal contains and on the amount of heat energy the coal can produce. The rank of a coal deposit is determined by the amount of pressure and heat that acted on the plants over time.

Coal miners were paid by the amount and quality of the coal they produced, and they could be fined if there was too much "slack" (the smaller pieces). Quality coal was what owners required, but managers determined the standards for quality coal. Owners could keep costs low by claiming the coal was of a poor quality or rigging their scales.
