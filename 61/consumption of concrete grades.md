M15 concrete grade concrete gets categorized as an ordinary grade. Its features, properties, and uses are quite close to M10 with a very slight difference.. PROPERTIES OF THE M15 GRADE CONCRETE: It contains a mix ratio is 1:3:6.1 cement .3 sand and six aggregate.M-15 M represents the mix, while 15 N/mm2 is the concrete cube's characteristic compressive strength for 29 days.

Jan 09, 2017 · GRDSLAB is a spreadsheet program written in MS-Excel for the purpose of analysis of concrete slabs on grade.  Concrete consumption in grade beam foundation is less compared to the conventional foundation. The major disadvantage of using a grade beam foundation is that it cannot allow the construction of the basement.

The nominal mix grades of concrete are generally used for small-scale construction where concrete consumption is not so high. Besides the design mix concrete are those whose mix ratio proportions are obtained from various lab tests by considering the various process in concreting properties of concrete and quality of material used for the preparation of concrete.

## How is cement consumption determined for the various grades of concrete?
Answer (1 of 2): For example we consider M20 as concrete. It's proportion of cement, fine aggregate n coarse aggregate is 1:1.5:3. For instance we take as 1cum. Adding proportion of M20(1:2:4) = 1+2+4=7 cement quantity is=(1/7)1=0.142 cum.Density of Cement = 1440kg/m3. Total Cement=0.1421440
