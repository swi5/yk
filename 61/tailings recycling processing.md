It reached 7 billion tonnes of mine tailings generated yearly worldwide, and 19 billion solid tailings will be accumulated by 2025. Adding to this, the legacy of environmental damage from abandoned mines is worrying; there are around 10,000 abandoned mines in Canada, 50,000 in Australia.

## Tailings
In mining, tailings are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden, which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.. The extraction of minerals from ore can be done two ways: placer mining, which

## How to generate value from tailings with reprocessing to be future 
With advent of novel technologies, mining companies are now figuring out ways to extract valuable metals from tailings. In gold, copper sulfide and iron ore tailings, the potential of extracting minerals is an opportunity. Reprocessing tailings to collect the valuable minerals can be a cost-effective approach compared to processing virgin material.

Mechanical and chemical processes are used to extract the desired product from the run of the mine ore and produce a waste stream known as tailings. This process of product extraction is never 100% efficient, nor is it possible to reclaim all reusable and expended processing reagents and chemicals.

Tailings dry discharge. It is a new process using dewatering type cyclone, high-frequency dewatering screen and high-efficiency deep cone thickener. It can reduce the water content in tailings to less than 15%, and save costs, which can effectively avoid environmental pollution. 3. Filling the mined-out areas.

## (PDF) Phosphate Amendments for the Inhibition of Acid Mine Drainage 
The aims of this paper was to evaluate the efficiency of phosphates product and by-products from the Djebel Onk mine for the control of acidic mine drainage generated by exposure of Sidi Kamber mine tailings to climatic conditions. Kinetic tests in

## Coal tailings reprocessing and fines recovery - Mineral Processing
Coal Mining and Processing has left a trail of waste dump and tailings in slime ponds. This warrants development of processes for recovering value from rejects of yester years. In this paper, pros and cons of enrichment of tailings have been dealt with. The process of flotation has been examined through kinetics approach.

## Are spoils and tailings the same?f
What are tailings for? Tailings dams are used to store water and waste that come as by products from the mining process.It is estimated there are at least 3,500 tailings dams around the world. But as there are around 30,000 industrial mines, the number of tailings dams is likely to be much higher.
