Coal provides 40% of the world's electricity and it produces 39% of global Carbon Dioxide emissions. It's one of the drivers of our current issue with Global Warming. It's a dirty source of fuel and it's destructive to people and the environment from the moment it is mined. The effects of mining coal on the environment

## Thermal coal exposure - Sustainable investing - Robeco
(Thermal coal differs from coking coal, which has a higher energy content and is chiefly used in metal making rather than electricity production.) Coal's principal problem is that burning it is the largest source of CO2, accounting for 14 trillion tonnes of emissions in 2016, and about 25% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, the IEA says.

Temperature is affected by coal mining because the burning of coal leads to an increase in the severity of climate change. This climate change leads to a global increase in the temperature.  Furthermore, closer to the poles, the global warming is causing ice to melt. But the process of melting cools the water also making it more dense. When

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

Coal mining will have a part to play in the future of global warming. Coal Miners will have no fear of losing their jobs in the very near future. The UMWA is down right now, but it will survive, and could rise again to be the powerful union it once was.

If we assume it takes about two years, at $60,000 per year, to retrain the roughly 100,000 US coal workers, it works out to $12 billion. And the paybacks are huge, economically and politically. Electricity via clean energy could ultimately replace oil in fueling our cars, as well as heat our homes and power our appliances.

What we do know is that coal, when burned, has by far the biggest climate footprint of any fossil fuel, producing more carbon dioxide per unit than oil or gas. In the U.S. alone, coal produced 65% of the power sector's planet-warming emissions. The 1966 article in the Mining Congress Journal certainly raises questions about what the coal
