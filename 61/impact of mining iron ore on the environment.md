## Environmental Impacts On Mining Iron Ore
As mentioned previously mining activities can harm the environment in several ways. These are as follows Air Pollution. Air quality is adversely affected by mining operations. Unrefined materials are released when mineral deposits are exposed on the surface through mining. For example lead ore mining in.

## Question: What are the environmental impacts of mining iron ore in 
What are the environmental impacts of iron ore mining? The mining of iron ore is highly energy intensive and causes air pollution in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from diesel generators, trucks and other equipment. The mining of iron ore also causes water pollution of heavy metals and acid that drains from the mines.

Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants. This can lead to air pollution via air contaminants, release of greenhouse gases like methane and CO2.
