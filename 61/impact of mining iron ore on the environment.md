Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants. This can lead to air pollution via air contaminants, release of greenhouse gases like methane and CO2.
