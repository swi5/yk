## Coal Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Coal production continues to grow globally due to the demand for low cost energy and iron and steel, as well as cement. Coal, based on the current extraction rates, will last about 115 years longer than conventional oil and gas reserves, with an estimated 1.1 trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. Ten countries are responsible for 90% of the total global coal production.
