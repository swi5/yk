## breaking mechanism of jaw crusher - Felona
Jaw Crusher ScienceDirect. Jan 01, 2016 The mechanism of movement of rocks down the crusher chamber determines the capacity of jaw crushers. The movement can be visualised as a succession of wedges (jaw angles) that reduce the size of particles progressively by compression until the smaller particles pass through the crusher in a continuous procession.

## Why The Jaw Crusher Is The Best Mechanism For This Industry
The jaw crusher is an innovative device that is so important to the construction industry. It is this device that enables large boulders to be broken down into usable aggregate material. There are different types of jaw crushers, as well as crushers in general, that all play a role in this process. Each stage of the breaking down of stone is

## Compression Mechanism In Jaw Crusher
Using compression methods, jaw crushers can handle and reduce many large-sized materials. The jaw crusher uses a stationary jaw plate and a moving jaw plate to create a unique "V" shape.30 to 70. 320. 50 to 60. 10.8. Jaw Crusher is ideally suitable for primary and secondary crusher for material with compression strength less than 320MPA.

Just like jaw crusher, it is also a compression type crusher whose reduction ratio is 4:1 to 6:1. When cone crusher works, it uses the force between moveable mantle and stationary bowl liner to crush material. As the material is getting smaller, it keeps moving down along the crushing cavity until being discharged from the discharge opening.

## crusher mechanism jaw
The mechanism of movement of rocks down the crusher chamber determines the capacity of jaw crushers. The movement can be visualised as a succession of wedges (jaw angles) that reduce the size of particles progressively by compression until the smaller particles pass through the crusher in a continuous procession.
