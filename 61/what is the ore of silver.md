What does silver look like in ground? Look for rocks that have either a rough dark gray to sooty black look or a silvery metallic look. . Rich silver deposits are found in rocks with a mixture of red pink and dark sooty crystals. The silver is in the dark crystals while the red and pink crystals are a manganese mineral called rhodochrosite.
