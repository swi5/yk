## Hazardous waste permit application-tec
Anyone proposing to construct and operate a dangerous waste facility in Washington must comply with state and federal laws and regulations. One of those requirements is to obtain a final status, or Part B permit, from us. The formal permitting process involves many steps. Years may pass between the time a facility submits a Part B >permit</b>.

## Slag: From By-product to Valuable Construction Material
Slag is a by-product of the metallurgical smelting process. Slag has a double role: it permits removal of impurities, known as gangue, from the melt by forming oxides. It also allows exchange reactions with the liquid metal, permitting control of the process in order for the desirable elements to stay in the melt while the others are removed.
