Transferrin saturation, abbreviated TS and measured as a percentage, is the ratio of serum iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC).TS is a more useful indicator of iron status than just iron or TIBC alone. In iron deficiency, the iron level is low but the TIBC is increased, thus transferrin saturation becomes very low.; Liver biopsy with measurement of hepatic iron index is the gold standard.
