If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills. Ball mills may be primary or secondary grinders.

## Mill (grinding)
Ball mill. A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill. A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls, usually stone or metal, which grind material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls. Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%.

## Thrust Bearings (Ball) | American Roller Bearing
Thrust Bearings. Thrust bearings are designed to accommodate axial load in one or both directions. The single acting carries the load in one direction while the double acting can carry the load in both directions. There are several design types and configurations for thrust bearings to suit a variety of load capacities and applications.

## Ball Mill | Baking Processes | BAKERpedia
What is a ball mill? A ball mill is a size reduction or milling equipment which uses two grinding mechanisms, namely, impact and shear. 1 Unlike other size reduction equipment, such as breakers and jaw crushers, ball mills are capable of producing powders and particulate materials of mean particle sizes within the 750 to 50 micron (µm) range.. Ball mills serve both dry and wet milling

## Ball mill
The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials, and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement, silicates, refractory material, fertilizer, glass ceramics, etc., as well as for ore dressing of ferrous and non-ferrous metals. The ball mill can grind ores and other materials, wet or dry.

## Ball Mills
Ball mills have been used for decades to grind and mix materials used in the ceramic industry. SHIMPO's heavyduty ball milling machines enable very precise milling, in porcelain jars, even for relatively tough materials, wet or dry. SHIMPO ball mills have a compact design that is ideal for small-scale production and is constructed using
