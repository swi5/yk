## Use of belt conveyors for manriding in the Boleslaw Smialy black coal 
The PTG conveyor is exclusively used for manriding while the GWAREK-1000 conveyors are also used for coal transport. Position of belt conveyors used for manriding in inclined workings is shown in 3 schemes. Comparative evaluations show that use of belt conveyors for manriding in mine sections with inclined workings increases labor productivity.

## What are conveyors used for? Five ways a conveyor can be used
Heavy-duty conveyors can be built for a range of applications from being designed to withstand chemical corrosion to being able to transport large amounts of coal. While we mentioned earlier that conveyors can be used to move vehicles on a production line, these production lines could well use heavy-duty conveyors, as I'm sure you can imagine
