A ball mill is a form of grinder that is used to blend or grind materials for use. It is a cylindrical device mainly for grinding material such as iron ores, ceramic raw materials, glass, steel, etc. The ball mill works on impact and attrition principle. Its impact is the size reduction given that the balls drop from almost the top of the shell.
