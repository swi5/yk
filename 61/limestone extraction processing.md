Twenty-four hours after tooth extraction, all of the teeth should be brushed (including the teeth adjacent to the surgical site). Don't scrub too hard. Instead, carefully clean the surface of all teeth, including "nooks and crannies" where food can get stuck. At this time, you should also start using salt-water rinses.

## Lime in Flotation and Recovery Processes | Graymont
Lime is used extensively in the recovery of gold and silver. Ores, either run-of-mine, milled, autoclaved or roasted, are combined with lime and a cyanide solution. The cyanide dissolves the gold and silver. Lime maintains proper pH in the cyanide solution, keeping it in the liquid phase and preventing the formation of hydrogen cyanide gas and its loss into the atmosphere.
