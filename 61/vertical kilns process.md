## Vertical Lime Kiln Production Process
Vertical Lime Kiln. The raw material descends under the action of its own gravity in the lime kiln At the bottom of the kiln a roots blower cools the lime at the bottom of the kiln The wind from the bottom exchanges heat with the lime and enters the calcining zone as fuel after its temperature reaches 600 degrees.

## Lime kiln
A lime kiln is a kiln used for the calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce the form of lime called quicklime (calcium oxide).The chemical equation for this reaction is . CaCO 3 + heat → CaO + CO 2. This reaction can take place at anywhere above 840 °C (1544 °F), but is generally considered to occur at 900 °C(1655 °F) (at which temperature the partial pressure of CO 2 is 1
