## Influence of Iron Ore Fines Feed Size on Microstructure, Productivity 
Since iron ore proportion is at higher side in the sinter mix, its size fraction is very important. JSW Steel sinter plant receives iron ore fines of -10 mm size from Bellary - Hospet region which consist of 3 to 9% bigger than 10 mm and 30 to 35% smaller than 0.15 mm size fraction.

## Fairly recently I potted up a "soup cans-vettelschoss
Fairly recently I potted up a "soup can forge" that used a mix of sand and perlite with plaster of paris laid into a big soup tin to make a forge for smaller items. I've already used it for heat treating a custom made cutter for the machine shop. Works a HUGE amount better than trying to heat stuff up in the open.

Iron Ore Sinter Iron ore sinter - A bulk material for blast-furnace smelting, which is made by sintering ore, limestone, fine coke, screened sinter and blast-furnace dust on special belt sintering machines. Sinter quality is determined by the Fe content of iron ore, strength, destruction during heating and reduction in a blast furnace.
