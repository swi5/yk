("How sand is made", 2016) Sand as you already know is made up of silicon dioxide but it's actually composed of 80%-92% silica, up to 15% alumina, and 2% iron oxide. There are five steps for manufacturing and the steps include: natural decomposition, extraction, sorting, washing, and in some cases crushing. The steps in detail:
