Please note that Gravel Tech does NOT haul, sell, or deliver any gravel at all. We do however, provide the labor and equipment necessary to restore a gravel driveway using the existing driveway material.. The formula gravel pits use to calculate required tonnage for a 3" application is: Length x Width x Depth x 100 ÷ 2000 . eg: 600' x 10'x .25ft (or 3") = 1500.

## Agricultural Limestone vs Dolomite - Braen Stone
Pros - Like aglime, dolomite is able to very effectively raise soil pH. At the same time, it's able to correct soil with a magnesium deficiency. For optimum health, sandy soil should have a calcium to magnesium ratio of 7:1 for sandy soil and 10:1 for clay-based soil. Cons - Dolomitic lime shouldn't be applied where it isn't needed.
