The mine claim is privately owned and was open to collecting for a fee. Open cut mining uses bulldozers and backhoes to cut wide furrows in the ground. Much of the open cut mining is found in the Queensland mining areas. Making a "cut" with a dozer saves a lot of pick and shovel work! Once again, the early miners cut these furrows by hand.
