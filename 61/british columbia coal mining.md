Canada is in 13th place, producing 1% of the world's coal supply. Canada is the 4th largest coal exporter in the world behind Australia, the US and Russia. Most of the coal produced in Canada comes from Alberta and British Columbia. Coal stocks are stocks in any companies that mine and process coal for electricity plants and steel production.

## Regional study of coal mine waste dumps in British Columbia, stage II 
Abstract. Open pit coal mining operations in the Rocky Mountain Region of B.C. and Alberta were studied to assess the behaviour and performance of waste rock dumps. Since 1980 there has been an increase in failures and periods of high rates of deformation corresponding to less favourable conditions and increased number of operations.
