## Identifying Major Iron Ore Mining and Mineral Processing Stages
Beneficiation is required since many iron ore processing technologies have specific requirements, such as the size of the ore pellets and chemical composition, to obtain suitable concentrate (Weiss, 1985 cited by US EPA, 1994). The two main stages consist of a number of process stages which are shown in Figure 2.4 and discussed below.
