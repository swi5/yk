## What is a Fixed Chimney Bull's Trench Kiln (FCBTK)?
FCBTK is a modified version of the Bull's trench kiln (BTK) introduced in India by a British engineer W. Bull in 1876. Initially it had movable metal chimneys, which were placed ahead of the fire on the brick setting and were moved as the firing progressed. This technology was modified to the more efficient and less polluting FCBTK.
