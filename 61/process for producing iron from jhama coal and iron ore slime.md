## Iron ore slime as an alternate coolant in steelmaking: Performance 
Though its Fe content (about 54% Fe (Manna et al., 2011)) is higher than that of many ores elsewhere in the world, it is unacceptable to blast furnace iron making for its alumina and silica content exceeds the acceptable limits, and hence discarded in slime ponds. A rough estimate from the iron ore production data of Indian Bureau of Mines for

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

About 98% of world iron ore production is used to make iron in the form of steel. Iron in cast form has many specific uses (e.g. pipes, fittings, engine blocks) but pure iron is quite soft. Adding a small amount of carbon (usually less than 1%) makes iron into steel which is significantly harder and extremely versatile.

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

The bottom ash has the potential to substitute sand as filter material. Because of this, a comparison is needed between the two materials, which are given below. The specific gravity of iron ore slime is very high (∼2.81) due to iron content, whereas it is ∼2 for bottom ash and ∼2.5-2.6 for sands.

## Process to Recover Iron Values from High-Alumina Indian Iron Ore Slime 
In India, approximately 15-20% of Run of Mine (ROM) from any iron ore deposit is reported to slime dam as a byproduct of the iron ore beneficiation process. The proportion of iron ore slime to ROM will increase in the future, with a higher proportion of lean-grade ores in ROM. Furthermore, tonnages of iron ore slime will increase with increasing demand of iron concentrate.

then reacts with the iron ore to form carbon dioxide and pure iron. Separating the iron from the slag 2 The melted iron sinks to the bottom of the furnace. The limestone combines with the rock and other impurities in the ore to form a slag which is lighter than the iron and floats on top.
