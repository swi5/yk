Primary steelmaking uses a blower to force oxygen through molten iron, whereas secondary steelmaking is characterized by the use of an electric arc. The electric arc is able to heat up the scrap iron until it achieves a molten state. Furthermore, it's important to note that primary steelmaking doesn't dissolve the oxygen.

The primary motion absorbs most of the power required to perform a machining operation. Primary motion has the purpose of removing the metal (chip) from the workpiece. The feed motion is a motion that may be provided to a tool or workpiece by a machine tool which, when added to the primary motion, leads to a repeated or continuous chip removal

In machining, several operations occur in a planned sequence to achieve the best results. We cover three of the most common operations including turning, drilling, and milling. Machining is a very common and versatile manufacturing process. Thus, it's possible to machine various types of material using these three methods.

Primary/ secondary piping is a versatile piping method that's increasingly being used as the backbone of modern multi-load/multi-temperature hydronic systems. The concept of primary/secondary (P/S) piping has been around since the mid 1950s. Until the last decade, it was used mostly for larger commercial heating and chilled water cooling systems.
