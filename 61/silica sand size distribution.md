## Molding Sand: Particle Characterization :: Microtrac
Foundry sands usually have a size distribution from 0,1 mm - 0,8 mm with a mean size between 0,2 mm and 0,45 mm. A standard parameter to express the size of molding sands is the AFS fineness number (AFS = American Foundry Society). This number is calculated from the size distribution, which is determined by standard ASTM sieves.

## What Is Silica Sand & How Is It Different From Regular Sand?
Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). The most common form of SiO2 is quartz - a chemically inert and relatively hard mineral. SiO2 grades at a 7 out of 10 on Mohs hardness scale, making it

## Glass Sand - CDE Asia
The production of these specialist silica sands for application in glass manufacturing requires specialist screening and classification equipment from CDE. This complex process will first involve a detailed analysis of your feed material both in terms of the particle size distribution (PSD) and the chemical properties of your silica sand.
