## Quartz vein gold - GOLD PROSPECTING - Nugget Shooter Forums
I've always pried out the quartz vein and looked for gold trapped within the quartz. I've not had much luck. I know the contact spots are good places for gold to occur. A lot of veins I see are right up against a huge rock or fault, or between two visible faults on either side of the vein, but sometimes there's just one rock face.

This can be an indicator of gold. Iron Staining & Gossans: Not all veins produce much quartz - gold bearing veins can consist of calcite or mostly sulfides - which often weather into iron stained spots when the pyrites convert to iron oxides. Large amounts of iron oxides like hematite, magnetite and ironstone can be favorable indicators.

Answer (1 of 12): No they do not. Quartz is common, gold is rare. Quartz veins typically form when very hot water rising from depth flows into a shallow crack in the rock. The dissolved silica precipitates as quartz. If there is gold present in the water, it will also precipitate. The result is
