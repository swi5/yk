Some sand is also coated with polymers or otherwise treated to improve its properties for hydraulic fracturing applications. If specific dust-reduction controls are not in place at the mines and processing plants as well as during transport, there is the possibility for silica dust and RCS to be released into the air during each of these processes.

Stress-dilatancy relationship is the basic mechanical property of sand, and it is the flow rule in plasticity. For crushable calcareous sand, triaxial tests show that the stress-dilatancy curve contains an apparent turning hook around the peak stress ratio, while this hook corresponds to the main part of loading process, including the phase transformation point and the peak stress ratio point
