## Iron-rich sedimentary rocks
Iron-rich sedimentary rocks are sedimentary rocks which contain 15 wt.% or more iron.However, most sedimentary rocks contain iron in varying degrees. The majority of these rocks were deposited during specific geologic time periods: The Precambrian (3800 to 539 million years ago), the early Paleozoic (539 to 419 million years ago), and the middle to late Mesozoic (205 to 66 million years ago).

## What is the difference between limestone and shale? - Quora
Limestone is a chemical sediment formed of calcite (calcium carbonate). The calcite is typically derived by biogenic precipitation from sea water. Shale is a clastic sediment composed mostly of clay minerals which are very small grains. Most of the clay is formed by the surface weathering of feldspar of igneous and metamorphic rocks.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
