## the future of coal mining in south africa
The current turbulence in the mining industry in South Africa has its roots in several different factors First, the fall in global demand for platinum and other minerals due to recession second, the consequences of the Marikana disaster in destabilising labour relations and third, the structural character of our mining industry A great deal has been written about the first two factors, so .
