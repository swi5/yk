## Lightweight Aggregate Concrete - The Constructor
The less weight of light weight concrete is due to the usage of fine and course lightweight aggregate. When the complete aggregate is replaced with lightweight aggregate, the weight decreases the concrete density of by approx. 10 kilogram per cubic meter. For Example, 1 square foot of 1.5-inch thick normal concrete weighs about 18 pounds.
