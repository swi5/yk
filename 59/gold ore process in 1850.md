Identify gold ore by physical properties. （A）Tarnish: Gold nuggets or small pieces of gold are usually bright and free of stains. If you find some rust on the surface of the ore, it is likely to be pyrite. （B）Color: Most native gold is alloyed with silver, and if the silver content is high enough, the ore will have a whitish-yellow color.

The Opal Prospect is a gold mine located in Kern. The discovery of cinnabar - from which the metal mercury is extracted - in the mid-1880s, drew miners to the area, creating a city of 2,000 people. Now, the only remnants of the mining days are a ghost town of the Howard Perry-owned Chisos Mining Company and several nearby capped and abandoned

The gold processing industry is experiencing change. As free-milling and oxide ores become depleted, more complex polymetallic and refractory ores are being processed, coupled with increasing pressure for stricter environmental compliance. Recent years have also seen a steady reduction in mineral processing and metallurgy graduates and a gradual loss of older operating experience.

## Here Is The Correct Way To Effectively Recognize Gold Ore
It is possible to detect gold with a specially designated metal detector. A prospecting detector can find gold as small as a half a grain. As the size of the gold becomes larger, gold nuggets can be located at deeper depths. A single grain nugget can be found at a depth of 1-2 inches.
