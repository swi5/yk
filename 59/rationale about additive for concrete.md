These admixtures give a much higher performance than the normal plasticizers. They are also known as plasticizers or high-range water reducers (HRWR), reduce water content by 12 to 30 percent and can be added to concrete with a low-to-normal slump and water-cement ratio to make high-slump flowing concrete. Flowing concrete is a highly fluid but

## Mineral Admixtures used in Concrete and Their Importance
In general, all mineral admixtures reduce bleeding of concrete. Admixtures with finer particle size and higher specific surface area are suitable for preparing high density and low permeability concrete. Increase in water demand due to addition of admixtures may be handled by the use of an effective superplasticizer.
