## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

## Open-pit mining
Typical open cut grades. Gold is generally extracted in open-pit mines at 1 to 5 ppm (parts per million) but in certain cases, 0.75 ppm gold is economical. This was achieved by bulk heap leaching at the Peak Hill mine in western New South Wales, near Dubbo, Australia.. Nickel, generally as laterite, is extracted via open-pit down to 0.2%. Copper can be extracted at grades as low as 0.11% to 0.2%.

Open-pit mining technology. Open-pit mining clearly offers a number of economic advantages over underground mining, especially now that mineral-processing technology has advanced to the stage where very low-grade ores can be treated profitably. 100 to 150 years ago, this was not the case, and mining was still much more selective.

The chemical formula of gypsum is CaSO4·2H2O. Plaster of Paris is prepared by heating gypsum to a temperature of 373K.When gypsum is heated to a temperature of 373k,It loses three-Fourths of its water of crystallisation and forms Plaster of Paris.. Plaster gives off heat as it starts to set up or harden.
