## Bentonite for foundry | Bentonite
Bentonite is used as a binder in foundry sands in molds production. Silica sand is the main component in foundry sand. It forms a structural framework of the mold due to bentonite as it binds sand particles which results in the mold strength. The main advantage of bentonite is an ability to restore its properties after extra moistening.

## Bentonite Clay's Role in Green Sand Metalcasting Foundry Systems
Calcium Bentonite (aka Southern Bentonite): The calcium ion concen­tration in this variety creates a lower swell green sand system with low vis­cosity, lower water absorption and the resulting quicker water loss. It is gen­erally considered to be easier to mull and provides higher green strengths but lower dry and hot strengths.

## Calcium Bentonite Vs Sodium Bentonite In Clay Bodies
Apparently calcium bentonite is often used in foundrys for its combination of plasticity and favourable green strength compared to sodium bentonite. Calcium bentonite might also have a helpful chemistry (or not!) for the clay body, which starts to become relevant when you are adding potentially 10% or 12% rather than 2% or 3% as a raw material.
