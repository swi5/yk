Large tunnels started to be cut into the Earth to access minerals buried deep underground. New processing methods meant new kinds of metals could be mined. The main stages in mining are: exploration, extraction, refining, manufacturing and marketing. We will take a brief look at exploration, extraction and refining.

## Know the Uses of Sulphur,-job
Mineral oil is the collective name for a range of byproducts of crude oil processing and refining. These compounds are mixtures of different weights and grades of hydrocarbons containing between 15 and 40 carbon (C15 to C40) molecules. Mineral oils undergo further distillation to remove contaminants such as sulfur, lead, vanadium and more.

Separation techniques mineral processing Flotation. Flotation is a gravity separation process which exploits differences in the surface properties of particles. Gas bubbles are generated in a liquid and become attached to solid particles or immiscible liquid droplets, causing the particles or droplets to rise to the surface. This is used to separate mixtures of solid-solid particles and liquid
