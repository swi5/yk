## Jaw Crusher vs Cone Crusher: A Comparison - Sepro Aggregates
Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.

## Which motor is preferred for jaw crusher?f
What is the difference between jaw crusher and cone crusher? The jaw crusher requires that the ore feeding must be even and not full, the materials in the jaw crusher chamber shall not exceed 2/3 of the crushing chamber height. The cone crusher can feed the ore with full load. It can be directly fed materials without vibration feeder.

For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.
