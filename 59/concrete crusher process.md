## Using pulverizer attachments to simplify concrete processing
The process of pulverizing it also allows steel rebar to be released from concrete," says Ray Szwec, BTI's eastern regional manager, about BTI's hydraulic pulverizer. Before the concrete reaches the final screening area, it passes through a series of magnets to remove as much metal residue as possible. Trueman employs a 48-inch hydraulic

## Mobile Concrete Crushers: 90-385 TPH | RUBBLE MASTER
Compact Concrete Crushers for non-spec material (jaw or impact) start at $150,000. Small bucket crusher attachments go for a little less but are very slow and lack the ability to separate rebar efficiently. Large closed-circuit tracked impact crushers can go upwards to $750,000 - $1,000,000. Of course, there are numerous options in between.

## That's because there is a higher percentage of natural stone crushed 
That's because there is a higher percentage of natural stone crushed into the mix. Blacktop is heated to a higher temperature of around 300 degrees, about 50 degrees more than asphalt.A blacktop road lasts longer than concrete, as it can bend and be resealed season after harsh weather season.Typically the price ranges from $1,000 - $6,000 and beyond.
