Siderite forms three solid-state solution series. It's the iron (Fe) analogue in a series with manganese (Mn) dominant rhodochrosite. It also forms the Fe-end of a series with zinc (Zn) dominant smithsonite, as well as with magnesium (Mg) dominant magnesite. Siderite has been used as an iron ore and for steel production.

## Siderite - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The most common iron carbonate is siderite (FeCO3 ), a frequent constituent of carbonate sediments and rocks on Earth. Siderite has a low-temperature transition at 30-35 K ( Housen et al., 1996 ), distinctively different from that of pyrrhotite ( Section 5.08.3.9 ). Siderite is paramagnetic at ordinary temperatures and carries no NRM.

Static code analysis is a process for analyzing an application's code for potential errors. It is "static" because it analyses applications without running them, which means an application can be tested exhaustively without constructing a runtime environment or posing risk to production systems. This makes static code analysis very well.

siderite, also called chalybite, iron carbonate (FeCO3), a widespread mineral that is an ore of iron. The mineral commonly occurs in thin beds with shales, clay, or coal seams (as sedimentary deposits) and in hydrothermal metallic veins (as gangue, or waste rock). Manganese (Mn), magnesium (Mg), and calcium generally substitute in part for iron; siderite forms a complete solid-solution

## What is the group name for the mineral siderite?
May 30, 2022How is siderite made? The formation of siderite, however, requires very particular environmental conditions. Siderite can only form under anoxic conditions due to the need for reduced, ferrous/dissolved or iron (Fe 2 +) to react with carbonate ion (CO 3 2); dissolved iron is rapidly oxidized in the presence of oxygen (Bachan & Kump, 2015).
