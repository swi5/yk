## What Is Brass? Composition and Properties - ThoughtCo
Brass is an alloy made primarily of copper and zinc. The proportions of the copper and zinc are varied to yield many different kinds of brass. Basic modern brass is 67% copper and 33% zinc. However, the amount of copper may range from 55% to 95% by weight, with the amount of zinc varying from 5% to 45%. Lead is commonly added to brass at a

## Machining aluminum and brass with a CNC machine
Where aluminum often sticks to the tool, brass seems to want to get out of the way. And yet, U.S. machine shops are underutilizing the machinability of brass by up to 85 percent . Its relatively low melting point and flow characteristics make it fairly easy to cast, and it is often used in electrical work, medical, plumbing, and more - but

When sanding or filing soft metals a lighter touch goes a long way to ensureing that the chips taken off by the grit or teeth are small enough that they do not clog the sanding material or the file teeth. For filing soft aluminium I use about 1/2 the pressure that I use on steel. This pretty much eliminates clogging.

## Bauxite Mining | The Australian Aluminium Council
The first step in producing aluminium is mining this ore. Bauxite occurs mainly in tropical and sub-tropical areas, like Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Australia. Australia is the largest producer of bauxite, with five large mines supplying around 30 per cent of global production. Bauxite mining has five steps:

## Surface Grinding Brass, Aluminum, and Copper. - Practical Machinist
We used it for brass, stainless, aluminum etc. Just glue the part to a steel base and grind away. Might want to use coolant, although it wasn't necessary for finish grinding. The secret was to apply pressure and wait for at least 1/2 hour for full bond strength before grinding.

## Process for refining brass and aluminum scraps
A process for refining brass and cuprous chloride includes contacting solid cuprous chloride with molten brass scrap which converts the zinc in the brass scrap to a zinc chloride  separating the alloy product from the aluminum chloride fume. 2. Process of claim 1 in which the aluminum chloride fume is contacted with steam in an oxidation

## Brass plating aluminum - Copper Alloys - I Forge Iron
The guy in the video was about to do some brass brush burnishing rather than plating.i must confess I got bored and did not watch it all. It works fine on steel cold and even better hot. I have used the process with a brass cup wire brush in the Ø100mm (4") angle grinder on a handrail project.
