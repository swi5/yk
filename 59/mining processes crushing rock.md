## mineral processing | metallurgy | Britannica
mineral processing, art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock, or gangue. It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy. The primary operations are comminution and concentration, but there are other important operations

In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate

Gold ore separation uses comminution techniques to break down the excavated rock, but the material hardly looks like a lustrous yellow-orange metal. In order to properly free this rich element from the rock, the crushing stage has to be followed by a chemically active stage, such as the cyanidation process or the carbon in pulp release method.
