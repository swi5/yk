The rock is granite. Study its appearance, and note that it also comes under Division C. Identify the black, or dark, or green mineral as hornblende or pyroxene, by good cleavage and hardness. Note light-colored crystals, hard and with good cleavage, as feldspar. The specimen is diorite, gabbro, or diabase, hard to distinguish from one another.

Shale is the most common sedimentary rock, accounting for about 70 percent of the rock in the Earth's crust. Shale is a fine-grained rock made from compacted mud and clay. The defining characteristic of shale is its ability to break into layers or fissility. Black and gray shale are common, but the rock can occur in any color.
