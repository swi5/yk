The rock is granite. Study its appearance, and note that it also comes under Division C. Identify the black, or dark, or green mineral as hornblende or pyroxene, by good cleavage and hardness. Note light-colored crystals, hard and with good cleavage, as feldspar. The specimen is diorite, gabbro, or diabase, hard to distinguish from one another.
