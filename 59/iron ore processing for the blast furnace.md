## iron processing - Iron making | Britannica
The scarcity of coking coals for blast-furnace use and the high cost of coke ovens are two reasons for the emergence of this other alternative iron-making process. Smelting reduction employs two units: in the first, iron ore is heated and reduced by gases exiting from the second unit, which is a smelter-gasifier supplied with coal and oxygen.

The unmelted iron ores still contain non-reduced iron oxides. An unfavourable accumulation of ores at the contact points can also make gas flow difficult and thus leave non-reduced iron ore behind. At the latest, however, when the melting process occurs in the deeper and hotter zones of the blast furnace, iron ores can be almost completely reduced.

blast furnace, a vertical shaft furnace that produces liquid metals by the reaction of a flow of air introduced under pressure into the bottom of the furnace with a mixture of metallic ore, coke, and flux fed into the top. Blast furnaces are used to produce pig iron from iron ore for subsequent processing into steel, and they are also employed in processing lead, copper, and other metals

Pig iron, also known as crude iron, is an intermediate product of the iron industry in the production of steel which is obtained by smelting iron ore in a blast furnace.Pig iron has a very high carbon content, typically 3.8-4.7%, along with silica and other constituents of dross, which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications.

## Blast Furnace Process - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The blast furnace process is primarily used in the carbothermic reduction of oxides, such as iron, zinc, and lead. Most of the iron ore bodies commercially explored consist of iron oxides. Consequently, rich iron ore and/or iron oxide pellets formed from concentrate can be added directly to a blast furnace (see Iron Production ).

## Whats a blast furnace used for? Explained by FAQ Blog
Metallurgical coke, along with iron ore and limestone, is layered into a blast furnace to convert the iron ore to metallic iron. Coke, which is mostly carbon, reacts with the blast air to produce carbon monoxide, which, in turn, reacts with the iron oxide to produce carbon dioxide and metallic iron. Why is it called blast furnace?

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces. Ninety-eight percent of iron ore mined goes into producing steel, the world's most common metal. By definition, steel is the element iron (99%) combined with carbon (1%). The iron in iron ore comes from
