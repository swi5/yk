## Digestion - breaking the large into the small - Science Learning Hub
Mechanical digestion. Food is taken into the mouth where it is broken down into smaller pieces by the teeth. As the teeth grip, cut and chew the food, saliva is released and mixes with the smaller food particles. Saliva moistens and lubricates the food, allowing it to be worked into a small ball called a bolus, which can then be easily swallowed.
