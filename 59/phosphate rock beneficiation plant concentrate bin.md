Rock phosphate. Rock phosphate is a naturally occurring ore of marine sedimentary origin. It may have a composition of 0-30-0, but the grade is noted as 0-3-0, since rock phosphate is sparingly soluble and little of the phosphorus is available to crops. Many of the mines that produced rock phosphate are closed, and most of the marketed rock

In the beneficiation of phosphate ore by the flotation of the siliceous material, the utilization of a condensate of a polyethylene polyamine, having from 10 to 24 carbon atoms, with a fatty acid, fatty acid ester or a fatty acid and an alkylolamine improves the separation of phosphate from silica. This improvement is especially great in the presence of unreacted fatty acid.

## Rock Phosphate Beneficiation
To concentrate phosphate rock in apatite (BPL or P2O5 content) we have to separate impurities from apatite using a beneficiation process. The beneficiation process could include a large variety of operations depending on the rock impurities content, the particles size and their hardness.  The slurry is pumped to a beneficiation plant. At the

## Phosphate Rock Plants: Background Information for Proposed Standards - EPA
The impact of the wet grinding process could be far-reaching since about 36 70 percent of all phosphate rock is ultimately used to produce fertilizer, and 85 percent of the rock used for fertilizer must first be converted to phosphoric acid.37 If wet grinding proves to be a trend in the industry (and present indications are that it will),38 the
