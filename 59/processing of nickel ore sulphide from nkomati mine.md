Naturally found in two forms, laterite and sulphide deposits, the majority of nickel currently mined is nickel sulphide, because it is easier and cheaper to process. [Image changes to a pile of manufactured nickel rods and then to a rock of nickel sulphide ore] However, the majority of the world's reserves, around 70%, are laterites.

## nickel processing - Extraction and refining | Britannica
The extraction of nickel from ore follows much the same route as copper, and indeed, in a number of cases, similar processes and equipment are used. The major differences in equipment are the use of higher-temperature refractories and the increased cooling required to accommodate the higher operating temperatures in nickel production. The specific processes taken depend on whether the ore is a

Nkomati Nickel JV has experienced a phenomenal growth rate over the past few years, from a 10 kt/month operation in 2006 to a 700 kt/month complex in 2013. This growth required the re-engineering of virtually every aspect of the operation, from mining new ore types with new methods, ore preparation and processing, to tailings deposition.

## Nickel mining in Australia - history, top locations and companies - GRT
The rise in nickel mining is attributed to the Kambalda region in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia. Nickel ore grades in the 1960s had 4% nickel but within a decade the nickel ore grade in Australia fell to 2%. Over the last 20 years, low grade laterite or sulphide deposits have posted an average ore grade of about 1.2%.

## What Are the Common Nickel Mineral Processing Technologies?
I am going to show you what are the common nickel mineral processing technologies. Actually, there are many kinds of nickel ore, which are mainly divided into Cu-Ni sulfide ore and Cu-Ni oxide ore according to mineral properties. So, Copper is the main impurity mineral in nickel ore, followed by lead, zinc, arsenic, fluorine, manganese
