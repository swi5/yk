However, reuse of coal combustion wastes as byproducts is permitted and 40 to 60 million tons (10 to 15%) are recycled annually according to the American Coal Ash Association. Boiler slag is produced in coal-fired power plants that use wet-bottom boilers. It forms from melted minerals left over from coal combustion.
