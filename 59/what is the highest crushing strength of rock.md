## Which rock has more strength, metamorphic, igneous, or  - Quora
Answer (1 of 2): Because metamorphic rocks have typically been subjected to very high temperatures and pressures in the metamorphic process they are usually quite dense and therefore, perhaps stronger on average than sedimentary or igneous rocks. But some igneous rocks like basalt can be very den

Mar 20, 2021 As aforementioned, the rock crushing strength from UCS test ranged from 22 MPa to 46 MPa due to the random internal flaws and discontinuities in the natural rock. To study the effect of rock crushing strength, the lowest and highest rock crushing strengths of 20 MPa and 50 MPa were adopted to carry out the numerical parametric study.
