## Summary of Mercury Amalgamation Gold Extraction Process
The principle of gold extraction by using mercury (amalgamation method) is mainly that after the mercury is added to the slurry, the surface of the gold particles is wetted by mercury, and then the mercury diffuses into the interior of the gold particles, causing a chemical reaction. Au+2Hg=AuHg2. Finally, the solid of Au3 Hg will form.

Gold and silver are often extracted together from the same ores or recovered as by-products from the extraction of other metals. A solid mixture of the two known as bullion or doré can be parted by boiling in nitric acid.  This is the most common method to purify gold. In this method strong acids are used as a means of dissolving impurities
