## Cadmium - GreenFacts
What is Cadmium? In its elemental form, cadmium is a soft, silver-white metal. It is not usually present in the environment as a pure metal, but is most often found in zinc, lead, and copper ores. Cadmium is not an element that is used by the body, and it is toxic. It mainly affects kidneys and bones. It is also a carcinogen by inhalation.

Cadmium (Cd) is a soft, malleable, bluish white metal found in zinc ores, and to a much lesser extent, in the cadmium mineral greenockite.

Sphalerite is an important ore of zinc; around 95% of all primary zinc is extracted from sphalerite ore. However, due to its variable trace element content, sphalerite is also an important source of several other metals such as cadmium, [43] gallium, [44] germanium, [45] and indium [46] which replace zinc.

A semiconductor is a material that has four valence electrons.Electric Conductivity. Metallic bonding causes metals to conduct electricity. In a metallic bond, atoms of the metal are surrounded by a constantly moving "sea of electrons".This moving sea of electrons enables the metal to conduct electricity and move freely among the ions..

Cadmium. Cadmium (Cd) is a very soft, silvery-white metallic element that can be cut with a knife. Cadmium has many chemical similarities to zinc and is often recovered from the primary zinc ore sphalerite. The single most important use of cadmium is in the production of nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cad) batteries.

Cadmium is a rare metal. The concentration of cadmium on the Earth is around 0.5 ppm (parts per million). Mostly it is present in the form of ores of zinc and sulfide. The sulfide ore of cadmium is termed as greenockite (CdS). Currently, cadmium is obtained from the mining, smelting and purification of ores of zinc sulfide, and copper sulfide.

## cadmium and zinc in ores
Cadmium (Cd) is a soft, malleable, bluish white metal found in zinc ores, and to a much lesser extent, in the cadmium mineral greenockite. In 2011, U.S. production of cadmium was estimated at 600 metric tons, down approximately 40% from the production levels 20 years ago (1992).

## Interactions between cadmium and zinc in the organism
It is well known that many toxic effects of cadmium (Cd) action result from interactions with essential elements, including zinc (Zn). These interactions can take place at different stages of absorption, distribution in the organism and excretion of both metals and at the stage of Zn biological functions. Exposure to Cd leads to disturbance in
