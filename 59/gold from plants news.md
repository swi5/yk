## Finding Gold Essentials - Plant & Soil Indicators
Changes in the color of soil can be another indicator of nearby gold. Iron staining is another excellent indicator that gold may be present. The iron stains are in yellow or reddish soil. Soil which contains iron may also be black, provided it has not oxidized. Where iron or other heavy metals are located, gold may also be found.

## Phytomining: Can plants really grow gold? - Manhattan Gold & Silver
The method of using plants to extract particles of gold from soil is called phytomining. It works by taking a fast-growing plant with leafy mass, such as mustard, sunflowers or tobacco, and planting the crop on soil that contains gold. Once the plants grow to their maximum height, the soil is then treated with a chemical to make the gold soluble.

If the solution is rich enough can be treated by zinc powder and the precipitated obtained (cement) obtained will be sent to retorting and smelting. For gold extraction the strength of cyanide solution ranges from 0.01 to 0.05%. Lime is added to the process in order to have a pH near to 10-11.

Magnesium, an imbalance of magnesium and calcium. It'll displace the calcium in the plant, and that in turn causes the plant to stunt its growth.
