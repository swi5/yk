## Uranium ore
Uranium is a silvery-gray metallic weakly radioactive chemical element.It has the chemical symbol U and atomic number 92. The most common isotopes in natural uranium are 238 U (99.27%) and 235 U (0.72%). All uranium isotopes present in natural uranium are radioactive and fissionable, and 235 U is fissile (will support a neutron-mediated chain reaction). Uranium, thorium, and one radioactive

## Nuclear power and the environment - U.S. Energy Information 
Nuclear energy produces radioactive waste. A major environmental concern related to nuclear power is the creation of radioactive wastes such as uranium mill tailings, spent (used) reactor fuel, and other radioactive wastes. These materials can remain radioactive and dangerous to human health for thousands of years.

## Environmental Aspects of Uranium Mining - World Nuclear Association
In most respects the environmental aspects of a uranium mine are the same as those of other metalliferous mining. Most uranium mines in Australia and Canada have ISO 14001 certification. Radioactivity associated with the uranium ore requires some special management in addition to the general environmental controls of any mine.

Uranium is a crucial compound that is used to power the nuclear power plants which generate electricity. Theoretically, a kilogram of Uranium-235 produces over 20terajoules of energy. Most nuclear power plants are powered by uranium-enriched fuel containing 3% uranium-235. The chemical-reaction is controlled by various nuclear-absorbing materials.
