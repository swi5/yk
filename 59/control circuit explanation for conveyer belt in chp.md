Definition. Conveyor belt splicing is the process of joining together two pieces of conveyor belt. Usually, this is done to either elongate the original conveyer belt or to repair a torn or damaged conveyor belt. Because there are so many industries in which conveyor systems are employed, there are many types of conveyor belts and components.

Do not put your hands on a moving conveyor belt. Provide proper illumination at the working zone. Ensure the 'OK' condition of the pull cord and emergency stop switch of the conveyor belt. Keep one skilled person with a 'walky-talky' near the pull cord. Communicate with the control room before aligning/tracking the running belt.
