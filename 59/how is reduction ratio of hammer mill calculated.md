FEECO hammer mills utilize a central rotating shaft, fitted with several "hammers" affixed to pivots on the shaft. As the shaft spins, the hammers are swung via rotational energy, causing them to collide with the material, breaking it up into smaller particles. Hammer mills are flexible, and can be used in a variety of applications.
