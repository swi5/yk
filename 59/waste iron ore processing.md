## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

Hematite and magnetite are the most common types of Iron ore. Roughly 98% of iron ore on the global market is used in iron and steel production. Another important mineral from which metallic iron is extracted is iron ore. Metal's high demand necessitates continuous mining and processing, which generates a large amount of solid and liquid waste.

## How to Treat Wastewater from Iron and Steel Industry? | Waste Management
The blast furnace process consists essentially of charging iron ore, limestone and coke into the top of the furnace and blowing heated air into the bottom. Combustion of the coke provides the heat necessary to attain the temperatures at which the metallurgical reducing reactions take place. ADVERTISEMENTS:
