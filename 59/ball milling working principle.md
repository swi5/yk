## Ball Mill Working Principle
The working principle of ball mill - Meetyou Carbide. The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force.

## Ball Mill Working Principle And Main Parts - GitHub Pages
Ball Mill Working Principle. To be chosen according to the grinding material, material is composed of a ball mill feed end of the hollow shaft is arranged in the tube body, when the ball mill cylinder rotation time, grinding body due to inertia and centrifugal force, the effects of friction, making it attached to the cylinder liner on the cylinder body away, when taken to the height of a
