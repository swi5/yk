## Bench And Pedestal Grinders | OSHA Safety Manuals
Secure both pedestal and bench style grinders securely to the floor or work bench to prevent movement during usage. Store grinding wheels carefully on racks in dry places, and visually inspect them for warping, chips, cracks or other damage before installation. Discard used wheels once they are approximately 2/3 worn.

The difference in this pedestal is clear at 1.72-inches tall versus the standard pedestal's 2.20 inches. It also measures 1.10-inches wide compared to the narrower 1.02-inch-wide C2AZ-B and C3AZ-A pedestals. The C5AZ-A cast-iron pedestal is Medium-Riser- and Tunnel-Port-specific, which means it is not designed for any other FE head.

## Which Grinding Wheel Should I Choose? | Norton
A grinding wheel is a precision tool with thousands of cutting points on its surface - abrasive grains that are held in place by a bond matrix (hence these are known as bonded abrasives) and separated by pores.. These pores are hollow spaces between abrasive grains and the bond, which help with the clearance of discarded metal chips in the grinding process.
