## Choosing the right crusher - Buying Guides DirectIndustry
Although it is known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, the cone crusher is better suited for secondary crushing. It is designed to crush pre-dimensioned materials, generally of 100 mm, 150 mm or 200 mm, and provide finished products of small dimensions. Advantages: Sturdy construction High productivity Easy adjustment

## What are the Different Types of Aggregate Crushers?
An aggregate crusher is a machine designed to grind or pulverize various types of rock into small, relatively uniform pieces. Aggregate crushers are used in mining, quarrying and recycling operations. Several types of crushers can perform this task including jaw crushers, gyratory crushers, impact crusher and cone crushers,.

In these applications we highly recommend a jaw crusher as the primary crusher, which reduces the rock down to 3-4", and then a cone crusher as the secondary crusher to further reduce down to the desired size. Often times the secondary crusher is not used and the primary crusher conveys into a screening plant which separates the material into

## Type of crushers and their difference - JXSC Mining
The double roll crusher is the most common rock stone crushing machine. Its crushing ratio is usually lower than in other crushers, so it's suitable for fine crushing. The roll crusher uses compression to crush materials, and the reduction ratio is 2 to 2.5 so roller crushers are not recommended for abrasive materials. Hammer Crusher
