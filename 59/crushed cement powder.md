## Analysis of Concrete by Adding Cement with Crushed Fluorescent Lamp Powder
This project deals with the study of concrete by partial adding of fine aggregate with the Fluorescent lamp powder. Trial mixes are performed to achieve a concrete of M20 grade where natural fine aggregate is substituted by weight with crushed Fluorescent lamp powder at the rates varying from 2,4,6,8 and 10percentages.

Crushed Concrete Fines. Crushed concrete fines are a recycled concrete product commonly used as a base for brick pavers, roadways, parking lots, and building pads. The spec on this material is 3/8 inch and minus down to a powder, with the bulk consisting of powder. Crushed concrete fines compact very well making it an ideal sub base.

These ingredients, when heated at high temperatures form a rock-like substance that is ground into the fine powder that we commonly think of as cement.  After quarrying the rock is crushed.

To make concrete a mixture of portland cement (10-15%) and water (15-20%) make a paste. This paste is then mixed with aggregates (65-75%) such as sand and gravel, or crushed stone. As the cement and water mix, they harden and bind the aggregates into an impenetrable rock-like mass. Therefore: Cement + Aggregates + Water = Concrete.

There will be very little cracking in asphalt because it reflects the heat. Do not apply over asphalt that has been sealed with tar because the surface becomes to slick for Portland cement to adhere. Best if applied in early spring on dry days. Driving and walking on powder cement is all it needs for compaction.

## How to Make Concrete Powder | Concrete Questions
Concrete powder determines the texture and strength of the concrete mixture that is being made. Concrete is made when the concrete powder is made into a paste by adding water and then adding aggregates like gravel and sand to the mixture to harden it. The most common type of concrete powder that we use today is Portland cement powder.

## Can You Use Cement That Has Hardened In The Bag?
When the cement mix inside of the bag starts to harden, either on the outer layer or throughout, the most likely cause is that it has been exposed to moisture of some sort. Not only that, but there is most likely a perforation or tear in the bag that allowed access for the moisture. It is important to store cement mix in a dry, secure place.

## Mixing concrete powder into the gravel - driveway - TractorByNet
Egon. For soil cement the CRUSHED gravel should have poper mix of fines to larger pieces to make it as dense as possible. Add the proper amount of cement and water and mix well by some mechanical means, smooth to grade and pack it. The mix is not a slurry and is very hard to tell from damp gravel.
