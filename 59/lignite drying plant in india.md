This is the vapour which emerges when drying of the lignite coal. The pressure of the heating steam is around 3 to 4 atmospheres. For swirling (fluidization), the system used is adapted to the specific conditions of drying of the lignite coal. Below the fluidizing bottom, the dry lignite coal is discharged from the fixed bed via star feeders.

Lignite, often referred to as brown coal, is a soft, brown, combustible, sedimentary rock formed from naturally compressed peat.It has a carbon content around 25-35%, and is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content.When removed from the ground, it contains a very high amount of moisture which partially explains its low carbon content.

## Lignite luminescence - Down to Earth
in a move to reduce emissions from coal-fired plants, India is installing a coal gasification plant. It will be the first commercial-scale coal gasification project in the world to use lignite for producing electricity and steam. Work is underway on an innovative 60- mw coal-fired integrated gasification combined cycle (igcc) co-generation plant in Madras.

## Lignite
Lignite is brownish-black in color and has a carbon content of 60-70 percent on a dry ash-free basis. However, its inherent moisture content is sometimes as high as 75 percent and its ash content ranges from 6-19 percent, compared with 6-12 percent for bituminous coal. As a result, its carbon content on the as-received basis (i.e., containing both inherent moisture and mineral matter) is
