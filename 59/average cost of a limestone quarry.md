The Feller Company purchased a site for a limestone quarry for $100,000 on January 2, 2007. It estimates that the quarry will yield 400,000 tons of limestone. It estimates that its retirement obligation has a fair value of $20,000, after which the land could be sold for $10,000. In 2007, 80,000 tons were quarried and 60,000 tons sold.
