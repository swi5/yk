Pelletized limestone has been on the market for years, but has only recently started to gain widespread popularity as an alternative to powdered lime. Although pelletized lime has a relatively higher cost than agricultural or powdered lime, it has incredible benefits over other forms. While this higher cost previously deterred people from using

4) Hydrating. In this step, hydrated also known as slaked lime is produced by reacting quicklime with water. CaO + H2O → Ca (OH)2. Applying Le Chatelier's Principle in the Production of Limestone: Limestone as a source of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is created from lime as a source of calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO2).

Coccolithophores are a species of white algae that capture carbon dioxide from the air through photosynthesis. The algae create calcium carbonate, which can be used as a replacement for quarried limestone in cement production.

How is limestone extracted? Limestone is extracted from the rock either by blasting or mechanical excavation depending on the hardness of the rock. rough crushing. After crushing the stone is sorted into different fractions by screening after which it goes to be processed further. In the grinding process the limestone is ground to a fine powder.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
