## Salem Limestone | Indiana Geological & Water Survey
Because the name Bedford stone had come to dominate the building-stone industry, the Salem was first formally named the Bedford Oolitic Limestone (Hopkins and Siebenthal, 1897). The formation was renamed the Salem Limestone by Cumings in 1901 because the name Bedford was preoccupied by the Bedford Shale of Ohio (Newberry, 1871).

## Origin Of Limestone | Eco Lime
Limestone is a very common sedimentary rock of biochemical origin. Limestone is a sedimentary rock made up of calcite (CaCO3) as its main mineral. Some limestones were formed by chemical deposition and others by the accumulation of shells from minute sea creatures. Many invertebrate animals (animals with no backbones) take calcite from sea

Oolitic limestone from the Mississippian of Indiana, USA. (Click on the photo to zoom in & look around.) Sedimentary rocks form by the solidification of loose sediments. Loose sediments become hard rocks by the processes of deposition, burial, compaction, dewatering, and cementation. There are three categories of sedimentary rocks: 1) Siliciclastic sedimentary rocks form by the solidification

The Salem Formation (a.k.a. Indiana Limestone) crops out along a thin, irregular arcuate band in south-central Indiana (Monroe and Lawrence counties).Most quarries lie between the cities of Bloomington and Bedford. The limestone is soft and easily worked when quarried, but once the quarried rock dries it becomes case-hardened, that is, its surface becomes harder and more resistant to weathering.

Answer (1 of 3): All limestones are primarily composed of calcium carbonate, which is a mineral called calcite. Most very dark limestone are very dark because: the calcite crystals are very very small or the calcium carbonate was produced below the region where sunlight penetrates ocean water

Origin of limestones Limestones originate mainly through the lithification of loose carbonate sediments. Modern carbonate sediments are generated in a variety of environments: continental, marine, and transitional, but most are marine. The present-day Bahama banks is the best known modern carbonate setting.

Limestone has quite a history. Long ago, limestone was used to build the pyramids in Egypt. And Romans would mix limestone with volcanic ash to form a type of concrete for building structures in Rome. Limestone is important to making cement, but it is also found in other industries such as sugar refining, glass making, and leather tanning.

## Limestone
Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes, though biological processes, such as the accumulation of corals and shells in the sea, have likely been more important for the last 540 million years.
