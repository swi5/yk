## How Is Iron Extracted From Its Ore - Realonomics
Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. . The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions. How do you extract ores? There are 3 main methods of extracting metals from their ore.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth?
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however, because iron does not occur naturally, it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

In 2019, the world's Top 5 lithium reserves by country were: Chile - 55.5% of the world's total.By contrast, the U.S. produced around 900 tonnes of lithium in 2020, accounting for just 1% of global production. This is partly because the country has only one lithium-producing.

## what apparatus is used to extract iron from its ore
Iron ore is converted to iron by various processes. The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to extract pig iron. Pig iron comprises of about 92-94% iron and about 3-5% of carbon along with other impurities. Pig iron has limited uses, so it is sent to steel plants where the content of carbon is further reduced.

## How Is Iron Ore Mined - Realonomics
How do we mine iron ore? The rock is mixed with water and ground in rotating mills until it is as fine as powder. The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism. The remaining rock is waste material and is dumped into tailings basins. The taconite powder with the iron in it is called concentrate.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).
