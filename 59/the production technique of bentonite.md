Sodium bentonite is also known as swelling clay because of its high level of swelling. It has a gray color and is used in industrial applications. You can find it as drilling mud and as a binder in the foundry as well as a clarifying agent in the production of beer or wine. It acts as a water softener to remove calcium from hard water.
