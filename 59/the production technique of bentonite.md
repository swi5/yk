Sodium bentonite is also known as swelling clay because of its high level of swelling. It has a gray color and is used in industrial applications. You can find it as drilling mud and as a binder in the foundry as well as a clarifying agent in the production of beer or wine. It acts as a water softener to remove calcium from hard water.

Bentonite is used in retention systems and for the control of stickies and pitch. Furthermore, it helps to improve the loop water treatment which reduces water consumption. Bentonite is ideal for use in cat litter due to its unique water absorption, swelling, and odour-controlling properties. It is an excellent anti-caking agent for animal feed.
