It is mined from ores of petalite (LiAl (Si2O 5) 2, lepidolite K (Li,Al) 3 (Al,Si,Rb) 4. The impact model for mine construction concludes that for each $1,000,000 of direct investment in lithium mine construction generates an additional $214,545 in secondary impacts. Of the $1,214,545 of total impact, $452,978 is from personal income and

## Extraction of Nickel | Nickel Ore Mining | Mining Equipment for Sale
The ore body generally does not require rock drilling or blasting. Nickel ore processing plant can directly use the excavator to shovel the ore. The thinner ore layers are first collected by the bulldozer and then shovel. nickel mining is divide into copper-nickel mining and extraction of nickel from sulphide ore.
