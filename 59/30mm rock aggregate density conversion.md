## converting cubic yards to tons - OnlineConversion Forums
Gravel, wet 1/4 to 2 inch - 1.69 tons/cubic yard. Depends on the type of gravel. I will show an example using loose dry gravel from the above list 416 cubic yards  1.28 tons/cubic yard = 532.48 tons (U.S. short tons) Just replace the density with the correct density from the list, depending on the type of gravel.

## Density of Construction Materials in kg/m3 and lb/ft3
Density is also called as unit weight of substance. It is represented by symbol called row ( p). Density represents the degree of compactness of material. If the material is of more density, it is more compacted material. Density is defined as the ratio of mass to volume. p = m/v Units = kg/m 3 or lb/ft 3 Conversion: 1 kg/m 3 = 0.624 lb/ft 3.
