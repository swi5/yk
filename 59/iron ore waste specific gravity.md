## how to calculate specific gravity of iron ore by example
The use of specific gravity in determining the grade of iron ore is not a new procedure. Eckel (1910, p. 38) pointed out the approxiÂ­ mate correlation between specific gravity of the Alabama iron ores and their iron content. Feld, Coe, and Coghill (1946) devised a rapid specific-gravity method for estimating the iron content of powdered

## Extraction of aluminium from bauxite igcse
The extraction of the metal from bauxite involves the three main steps. Concentration of Bauxite (Al 2 O 3 .2H 2 O) Concentration of ore is done by leaching which helps in removing impurities. How is aluminium extracted from its ore (bauxite)? What is the Hall-Heroult Process?Watch to find out!Catering for IGCSE and SPM students. Don't forget

## how to find out specific gravity of iron ore
Density, Specific Weight and Specific Gravity. Example 4: Specific Gravity of Iron. The density of iron is 7850 kg/m 3. The specific gravity of iron related to water with density 1000 kg/m 3 is. SG(iron) = 7850 [kg/m 3] / 1000 [kg/m 3] = 7.85. Example 5: Specific Weight of Water . The density of water is 1000 kg/m3 at 4 Â°C (39 Â°F). The
