Gypsum is also an industrial byproduct from coal-fired power plants, citric and lactic acid plants and water treatment plants. In coal-fired power plants, lime removes sulfur oxides from flue gas, forming calcium sulfate, or gypsum. And the higher the sulfur content of the coal, the greater the amount of synthetic gypsum produced.

## Why gypsum is added to alkaline soil?s
Gypsum is NOT lime. Gypsum is calcium sulfate (CaSO4).  When soil pH is too high, it can pose problems for plant health and growth. For many plants, soil that is high in alkalinity makes it harder for plants to drink in nutrients from the soil, which can limit their optimal growth.  Adding too much gypsum to the soil can lead to

Posts: 26. Location: Central CT, Zone 6. 2. posted 8 years ago. 2. Hi Bryan, Gypsum will boost calcium and sulfur levels but will not appreciably change pH (acidity). Limestone, on the other hand, will boost calcium and reduce acidity. A deep sandy soil generally lacks the storage capacity for minerals.

## 36 Reasons for Using Gypsum - Holloway Agriculture
Gypsum complements or even magnifies the beneficial effects of water-soluble polymers used as amendments to improve soil structure (Wallace and Nelson 1986). Like for organic matter, calcium, which comes from gypsum, is the mechanism for binding of the water-soluble polymers to the clay in soil. 14. Gypsum Makes Excess Magnesium Non-Toxic.

## The Use of Gypsum and Lime on Lawns and Gardens
The addition of lime can raise the soil pH to excessively high levels, reducing the availability of plant nutrients and leading to poor plant growth. Advertisements for gypsum often claim the addition of gypsum will help loosen heavy, clay soils and improve soil drainage. The addition of gypsum to Iowa soils, however, is of little benefit.

Gypsum therefore improves soil conditions much more rapidly than lime and will affect soil conditions to a greater depth than lime will. Gypsum will supply calcium to deeper depths than lime.
