## Sand | Parklea Sand and Soil
Yellow Brickie Sand is a 'fatty' sand most commonly used for brick and block work. 'Fatty' sand refers to the high clay content in the sand, which repels water (like fat) allowing the sand to become stickier and more workable when mixed with cement. The standard ratio for Yellow Brickie Sand mortar is 6 parts sand to 1 part cement.
