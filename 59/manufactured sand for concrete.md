## Reinforcing-selbsthilfegruppe
Hi So I have a concrete shed base to do and am planning to use fibres but unsure which ones to use. I've seen 12mm and 20mm. However some sites say 20mm make the concrete difficult to work with. From £45.90 Per Sheet. D49 Wrapping Mesh is manufactured from 2.5mm self colour wire and conforms to BS 4482:2005. It is manufactured to the latest

## Multi-scale creep analysis of river sand and manufactured sand concrete 
Aug 15, 2022This paper investigated the multi-scale prediction of long-term creep in river sand (RS) concrete and manufactured sand (MS) concrete and analyzed the effect of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) around the aggregate on the creep properties of concrete. Uniaxial compressive creep tests were conducted on the concrete for a duration of 360 d.

##  Manufactured Sand in Concrete.gov
Concrete Division Manufactured sand: Adoption barriers Concrete finishers hate it difficult to "close" with a trowel. like rubbing on stone with a trowel Pump operator hates it High pump pressure - more wear/tear Ready mixed guy hates it Higher water demand
