## Jaw Crusher - Aimil
This ensures maximum production in the lab and field. The Jaw Crusher is a primary sample preparation unit and is required for size reduction of various kinds of materials. Desired crushing takes place when fed particles experience pressure exerted by the jaw blade action. By this action the particles are crushed to smaller sizes.

## P&Q University Lesson 7- Crushing & Secondary Breaking
Today, primary crushing is viewed as more important within the balance of production and proper sizing needs. The size and type of the primary crusher should be coordinated with the type of stone, drilling and blasting patterns, and the size of the loading machine. Most operations will use a gyratory, jaw or impact crusher for primary crushing.
