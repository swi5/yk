Although necessary, these machines can pose a risk of fire, shock, or arc flash. And the cords connected to equipment also pose a trip and fall hazard to workers. Policies should be put in place and electrical safety training should be offered to miners. Specific training may need to take place for especially dangerous machines.

## Coal Mining Dangers: Safety Measures to Prevent Disaster - Segal Law
The most serious danger to a coal miner underground is methane gas - the natural by-product of mining coal. There are very specific safety measures that the Federal and State government require to protect miners. And you'll find that disaster after disaster after disaster, certain things were not done that should have been done to protect

## Hydraulic fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing, also called fracking, hydrofracking, and hydrofracturing, is a well stimulation technique involving the fracturing of bedrock formations by a pressurized liquid. The process involves the high-pressure injection of "fracking fluid" (primarily water, containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep

To regulate the hazards in mines, risk management has been proposed, implemented and mandated by Australian, New Zealand, Canadian, British, American and South African mining industries over the last few decades.
