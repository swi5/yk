## Tailings Management With Paste Thickening
Recovering water from a tailing stream and using it again upstream in the plant reduces the amount of fresh water a mine needs. The cost of water is frequently one of the primary drivers for implementing a thickened or paste tailings disposal system. Stacking. Surface stacking is the disposal of tailings on the surface of the ground.

## Solved: A 1000-tons/day ore-processing plant processes an ore that 
The plant recovers 100 tons/day of the mineral. This is not a very effective operation, and some of the mineral is still in the waste ore (the tailings). These tailings are sent to a secondary processing plant that is able to recover 50% of the mineral in the tailings. The recovered mineral from the secondary recovery plant is sent to the main

## Analytics in Mineral Processing - MinAssist
The problem. The major hurdle for advanced analytics in mineral processing is the complexity and variability of data collected. Data is often available on different time series, ranging from milliseconds for sensors to monthly for composite samples. This makes correlations between datasets complex, requiring additional levels of computation.

## Jagersfontein, tailings dam break : r/southafrica
The diamond recovery units on these mines only accept clean water in their processes. So if you think about all the nasty chemicals that are in these tailings dams, they won't accept it back into the processing plant. And tailings, especially Kimberlite, is a material that consolidates extremely slowly.

## Tailings dewatering | Weir Group
The foremost benefit of dewatering tailings is the reduction of water that needs to be transported from a process plant to a tailings storage facility (TSF). Reduced water content means tailings slurry volume is decreased, allowing for smaller pipelines and pumping equipment to be used. This can also minimise power requirements.
