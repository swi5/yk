## Lack of high-quality iron ore supply threatens steel's green push
A shortage of high-quality iron ore in the marketplace presents a significant hurdle for steelmakers who are trying to reduce their carbon emissions. Green hydrogen-based technologies use less carbon to produce steel, but the process requires higher iron ore grades than traditional blast furnaces. A dearth of ore with an iron content above 65%

## processes to improve iron ore quality
7/26/2019· While Britain had good iron ore reserves, the iron produced was of low quality with plenty of impurities, limiting its use. There was plenty of demand but not much was produced as wrought iron, which had many of the impurities hammered out, took a long time to make, and was available in cheaper imports from Scandinavia.

Impurities have a direct effect on the iron ore quality assessment. Phosphorus is an important factor. The more phosphorus content of the iron ore, the less quality it is and the less price it gets. Same it happens with Sulfur content. However, sometimes there are valuable impurities in the iron ore like Manganese minerals which increase the price.

2017 was a challenging year for iron ore mining and processing. An increased focus on air quality in China drove increases in price differentials between benchmark and sub-benchmark ores. At the front of everyone's mind: the iron ore price fluctuations that look set to continue this year, including the discounts being applied to lower-grade ore.

Dry processing is associated with the quality of the iron ore from the mine face. In Carajás, as the iron content is already high (above 65% Fe), the material is only crushed and screened to be classified by size (granulometry). In some mines of Minas Gerais, the average content is 40% Fe in itabirite.
