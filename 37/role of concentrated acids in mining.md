The proton donors, also known as Bronsted-Lowry acids, are the first type of acid. Proton donors in aqueous solutions form the hydronium ion H 3 O + and are known as Arrhenius acids.

## Role of microalgae in treatment of acid mine drainage and recovery of 
Heavy metals are non-biodegradable in nature present in very low concentration but eventually led to greater environmental issue of larger magnitude. Mining industry is a largest water user as it is a convenient medium for mixing chemicals, coal washing, storage also commonly use for waste discharge purpose.
