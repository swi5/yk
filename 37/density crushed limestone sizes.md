As specific gravity is just a comparison, it can be applied across any units. The density of pure water is also 62.4 lbs/cu.ft (pounds per cubic foot) and if we know that ammonium nitrate has a sg of 0.73 then we can calculate that its density is 0.73 x 62.4 = 45.552 lbs/cu.ft.

I just can't find a good approximation for the density of crushed limestone (my supplier sells by the ton, not the yard).  The closest I found was one ton is equivalent to approx 16 cubic feet. Does that sound close?? Also, is 3/4 size the best for this kind of application?? thanks, wingnut Upvote #2, 09:14 AM

Also, depending on the size of crusted limestone, the density changes as well, the finer to size the higher the density. I am not sure 1.3 holds true for all sizes.  Density of any crushed rock varies with smoothness/jaggedness of the pieces, and with uniformity/variation in size. Jaggedness tends to lower density as does uniformity in size

## The density of gravel - gravel, granite, limestone and slag. Bulk 
The density, from which the crushed stone is made, also influences the density. With the same volume - 1 m 3, the weight of the granite will be 2.6 tons. However, limestone due to impurities of quartz, dolomites, etc. - 2.7-2.9 tons. With the same weight, the volume will vary. As a result, large, unmilled rock takes up less space than recycled.
