Ans: Asphalt is known as a mixture of bitumen (as binding material) and a significant amount of inert minerals such as sand, gravel, and crushed stone. It has a blackish-brown colour and is available as a solid at low temperatures and as a liquid at temperatures above 50Â°C. Asphalt materials can be found in nature as natural deposits in many areas, but they can also be produced artificially.

## Mechanical properties of cement-treated aggregate material - A review 
Physical properties of coarse aggregates With regard to the physical requirements for aggregates, much attention is always paid to plastic index (PI) and aggregate crushing value (ACV). The value of PI is considered to determine whether or not the material is suitable for cement treatment.

## Technical characteristics and types of crushed stone
Crushed stone is a loose material of inorganic origin, consisting of grains from 5 millimeters in size and above. Crushed stone is obtained by crushing granite (rock), boulders and gravel. Technical characteristics of crushed stone are presented in its main properties: Crushed stone adhesion - is a characteristic feature of crushed stone.

Gravel is a major basic raw material in construction. Sand is not usually distinguished from gravel in official statistics, but crushed stone is treated as a separate category. In 2020, sand and gravel together made up 23% of all industrial mineral production in the U.S., with a total value of about $12.6 billion.

## Friction angle of crushed rock - Geotechnical engineering general
