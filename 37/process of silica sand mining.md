Silica sand mining is the process of mining to extract silica sands to be used for glass, solar panels and fracking. Very little of Manitoba's silica sand is of a pure enough quality for glass and solar panels. Cleaning sand to reach that quality is a very polluting process as it creates acid drainage.

Cement : Inconsiderable (because of fine particles) = 20% Dry volume is greater than 20% of wet volume = 100/100 + 20/100 = 1 + .20. As engineers select additional 5% to 10% for wastages and weak workmanship so that the quantities of cement and sand are not reduced, the mortar ratio is taken as follow :-= 1.20+ .1 = 1.30 Therefore, dry volume
