## What Is the Chemical Formula for Limestone?
Pure limestone is made up of two component minerals: calcium carbonate and calcium-magnesium carbonate. The chemical formula for calcium carbonate is CaCO3. The chemical formula for calcium-magnesium carbonate is CaMg (CO3)2. Calcium carbonate is commonly known as calcite,and calcium-magnesium carbonate is commonly known as dolomite.

Limestone. Limestone is added when melting in a cupola furnace for adjustment of the respective slag. In this process, unhydrated lime ( calcium oxide CaO) is reduced and a uniform slag flow is achieved. As a general rule, between 20 and 30 % of limestone is added.

No figures are available on the limestone used in sinter, the blast furnace and other furnaces. The very short oxygen blowing time for the BOF heats (15-20 min) presents continuing slag control problems, some of which are created by varying lime qualities.

Iron is made by reacting iron ore (iron oxide and impurities), coke (a reductant) and limestone (CaCO 3) in a blast furnace. Iron ores with lower iron content such as taconite are first processed to concentrate the iron level and drive off volatile impurities. The iron ore is dressed or crushed into 0.5-1 in. chunks, which increases surface

## Number 7 Blast Furnace - Engineering Channel
Number 7 Blast Furnace. Watch on. A blast furnace is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to produce industrial metals, generally pig iron, but also others such as lead or copper. Blast refers to the combustion air being "forced" or supplied above atmospheric pressure. In a blast furnace, fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are

## Durham Furnace - Durham Historical Society
The Furnace exported three tons of pig iron (according to James Logan's records) to England in 1728 as a sample but, at the same time, Russian iron was being shipped to England at a very low cost.  Limestone was still quarried in Durham. Records reflect that three-hundred and fifty men and boys were employed at the Furnace from 1849

Limestone can be crushed and used to build roads. The waste slag from the blast furnace can also be used for this purpose. Most limestone is obtained by quarrying, where the rock is blasted out of
