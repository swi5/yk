## Mexico Iron Ore Mining Process
Market Definition Global Iron Ore Mining Market Iron ore mining is the process of extraction of iron mineral from the various mineral deposits and rocks present in mines. The rocks are extracted and undergo the smelting process so that the melted iron can be poured into molds so that various ironbased products are formed.

Mining the ore. 1 The first step in retrieving lead-bearing ore is to mine it underground. Workers using heavy machinery drill the rock from deep tunnels with heavy machinery or blast it with dynamite, leaving the ore in pieces. Then they shovel the ore onto loaders and trucks, and haul it to a shaft.

Mining is the extraction of minerals and other geological materials of economic value from deposits on the Earth. Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil.
