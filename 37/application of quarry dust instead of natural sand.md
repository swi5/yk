## Use of quarry dust instead of river sand for future constructions in 
The construction industry of Sri Lanka expects a serious shortage of sand in the near future due to over exploitation of river sand. Then, the entire construction industry will be paralyzed if there are no alternative sources instead of river sand. Near-shore marine sand, dune sand and quarry dust (crushed rocks) are the other alternative sources available for it in Sri Lanka. Quarry dust may

## quarry dust instead of sand in india
The concept of replacement of natural fine aggregate by quarry dust which is highlighted in the study could boost the consumption of quarry dust generated from quarries. By replacement of quarry dust, the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and can also solve the problem of natural sand scarcity.

A separate study conducted by Verma et al. (2020), a form of quarry dust referred to as stone dust was utilized as a partial natural sand replacement. The stone dust was incorporated at 10% to 40% by mass of fine aggregate at a stepped increment of 10% in a binary and ternary cementitious binder system containing up to 15% of silica fume.
