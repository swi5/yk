## How Is Ore Mined? - Realonomics
The copper is recovered by electrolytic refining. Why do we extract metals from their ores? Metals need to be extracted from ores before they can be turned into useful products such as cars or cutlery. For example iron is found combined with oxygen in ores called haematite and magnetite. Which metal is easiest to extract from its ore?

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels, called adits, to reach the ore. Underground mining is, however, relatively expensive and is generally limited to rich ores. El Teniente, in Chile, is the world's largest

## What Does Copper Ore Look Like - Realonomics
How can you tell copper ore? In addition search for rocks that are green or pieces of ore that have green flecks. The green hue is characteristic of copper. Remove samples of the rocks and take them back to the lab for testing. If the rocks have a high part per million count of copper then you may have found a copper deposit.

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

Extracting value of gold is not just about removing the gold-bearing rock from the ground. This is just the first step in the process of mining gold. Complex extraction processes are involved in the isolation of pure gold from the rock. First, the large chunks of rock are broken down. With the help of crushers, the ore is reduced to tiny pieces.

Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander.

Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

## Gold Extraction from Different Types of Ore
2. Ancient placer gold ore. The ancient placer gold ore is the petrified placer ore, which is composed of the petrolized gravel. The particle size of 80% ore is between 75-100 microns. And this type of ore has a high grade. Gravity separation and cyanidation is a better process for gold extraction.

## How Is Copper Extracted - Realonomics
Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels called adits to reach the ore.
