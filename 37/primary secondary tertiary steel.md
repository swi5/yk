## What Do Primary, Secondary, and Post-Secondary Education Mean?
What Is Post-Secondary Education? Post-secondary education—also known as tertiary education—follows secondary education. Post-secondary education generally includes education at colleges, universities, or trade schools and typically occurs after the age of 18, though students in some countries may start a little younger.

## Primary, secondary and tertiary sector - Different Examples
Unlike the primary and secondary sectors, the tertiary sector is a very heterogeneous group of activities. These include hairdressers, doctors, merchants, street sweepers, among others. The tertiary sector is predominant in developed countries. For example, in Spain, more than 60% of the workforce is in the service sector from 2008 to 2021.

Primary sources are the surviving original records of a period, eyewitness accounts and first-published documentation of new information.. Examples of primary sources include: Peer-reviewed journal articles about one's original research or ideas. Autobiographies, letters, diaries, and journals describing one's personal experience, activities, and the people, places and events at the time.

Secondary sources may draw on primary sources and other secondary sources to create a general overview; or to make analytic or synthetic claims. [3] [4] Tertiary sources are publications such as encyclopedias or other compendia that sum up secondary and primary sources. For example, Wikipedia itself is a tertiary source.

The defining characteristic of secondary steelmaking, however, is its use of an electric arc. Primary steelmaking uses a blower to force oxygen through molten iron, whereas secondary steelmaking is characterized by the use of an electric arc. The electric arc is able to heat up the scrap iron until it achieves a molten state.

## Structural Steel - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Normal strength steel is used for secondary and tertiary members. Stairs, handrails, and some equipment supports are in this category. Those secondary beams that support major equipment and all primary members are fabricated with high-strength material. In special joints, extra-high-strength material may be used.

This is the outermost layer of packaging that's most often used by warehouses and manufacturers to ship the products (which are already wrapped in secondary packaging). The primary goal of tertiary packaging is to protect shipments during transit.

## Stages of Creep - Primary - Secondary - Tertiary - Material Properties
For secondary creep, sometimes termed steady-state creep, the rate is constant—that is, the plot becomes nearly linear. The strain rate diminishes to a minimum and becomes near constant as the secondary stage begins. This is due to the balance between work hardening and annealing (thermal softening). This stage of creep is the most understood.
