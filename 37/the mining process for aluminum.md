## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

## Aluminium | Geoscience Australia
Mining. Extraction of aluminium metal takes place in three main stages¿mining of bauxite ore, refining the ore to recover alumina and smelting alumina to produce aluminium.  All commercial production of aluminium is based on the Hall-Héroult smelting process in which the aluminium and oxygen in the alumina are separated by electrolysis

## mining process of aluminium
The aluminium production process - European Aluminium. Pure aluminium oxide, called alumina, is extracted from bauxite via a process called refining, composed of two steps: a digestion process, using caustic soda, which allows the separation of aluminium hydroxide from the so-called "bauxite residue", followed by a calcination step which removes the water content in the hydroxide.
