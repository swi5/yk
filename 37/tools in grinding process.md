Grinding HSS tool bits is an area of machining that seems very intimidating. There are a lot of videos on the subject, and lots of diagrams online of all the zillion angles you have to somehow create. Most instructional videos assume a high amount of freehand skill with a grinder, and the whole process seems unapproachable.
