The density, from which the crushed stone is made, also influences the density. With the same volume - 1 m 3, the weight of the granite will be 2.6 tons. However, in limestone due to impurities of quartz, dolomites, etc. - 2.7-2.9 tons. With the same weight, the volume will vary.

For ideal binder consumption and ease of compaction, it is better to use cube-shaped crushed stone. In this case, the grain size should be the same.
