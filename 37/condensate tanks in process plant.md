Through a series of plant trials, Bapco established that the high conductivity in the refinery condensate return systems was caused by the presence of NH3 in the 2H2P process condensate, at typical levels of 500 wppm, which had ended up in the superheated steam system, via the steam drum.

## Condensate - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The process of increasing the amount of intermediate (C 3 to C 5) and heavy (C 6+ ‏) components in the condensate is called condensate stabilization. This process is performed primarily to reduce the vapor pressure of the condensate so that a vapor phase is not produced upon flashing the liquid to atmospheric storage tanks.

## Best Practices for Condensate System Piping | Plant Engineering
The Power Piping Code B31.1 describes the minimum requirements for construction of power and auxiliary service piping. B31.1 applies to condensate piping when the pressure and temperatures are greater than 100 psi. However, it is a recommended practice to apply these standards to all condensate systems.
