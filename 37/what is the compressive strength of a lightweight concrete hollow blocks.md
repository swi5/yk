Overall Strength. The Masonry Advisory Council states that the minimum compressive strength for concrete blocks is 1900 pounds per square inch. Although, keep in mind, dense blocks are often stronger than this. The Mechanical Properties of Unreinforced Brick Masonry reports that the average concrete block can handle around 3500 psi.

## Comparison of Reinforced Concrete to Concrete Hollow Block - Cavite Homes
The compressive strength of a reinforced concrete is 2,000 to 2,500 psi compared to only 420 psi to 700 psi of a concrete hollow block. Since the compressive strength of reinforced concrete is greater than that of concrete hollow block, therefore a reinforced concrete panel is stronger and more resilient than a concrete hollow block.

A concrete block wall can be laid in less time and may cost up to half as much as a similar brick wall. The concrete blocks are generally made using concrete which is a mixture of powdered Portland cement, water, M-Sand, and gravel. Concrete blocks are used extensively for both load bearing and non- load bearing walls, externally and internally.

## Evaluating the Compressive Strength of Concrete Masonry - Ncma
If used with Type N mortar, any C90 unit can be used for projects having f'm values up to 1,350 psi (9.3 MPa). Conversely, if the concrete masonry units have compressive strengths of 2,800 psi (19.3 MPa), then the maximum f'm used in design would be 2,000 psi (13.8 MPa) if Type M or S mortar were used.

## Experimental investigation on tensile strength of hollow concrete blocks
In this paper, an experimental and statistical analysis was carried out from hollow concrete blocks. Firstly, 30 blocks were tested under compression force (vertical-direction). After, 60 blocks were studied under the splitting test from ASTM-C-1006 and, later a direct tensile test was applied to other 60 blocks. The blocks, in the direct tensile test, were subjected to a tensile force in
