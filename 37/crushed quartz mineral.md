Opal Hill Mine is located in eastern California, near the border of Arizona. This site location is sometimes called Coon Hollow and can be found deep in Mule Mountains. Currently, this location is closed as they get approved by the BLM to resume digging. Once it is reopened, they plan to allow the public to have access to the mine once again.
