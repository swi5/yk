1. Introduction. Comminution of the ore can take up to 30-50% of the total operating costs of mining (Aldrich, 2013, Jeswiet and Szekeres, 2016).The most energy intensive process in the comminution is grinding, for which the operation cost increases with the fineness of the product (Wang and Forssberg, 2007, Jeswiet and Szekeres, 2016).Generally wet grinding is favoured over dry grinding

Wet has its advantages. Wet grinding and polishing also increase diamond life dramatically on medium-hard to very hard floors and allow for more aggressive grinding. Grinding wet can effectively remove a significant layer of concrete to expose aggregate. It allows the diamonds to cut faster on medium-hard and very hard floors.

Batch mode allows for precise parametrization and constant repetitive conditions of the experiments. The following key aspects were tested: processing time, feed size, size of the grinding media, mass of the material and graining media

Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding Previous Next the grinding of the raw mix in a cement plant may be carried out either wet or dry but the grinding of the cement can from the nature of the material only be carried out dry Thus the inclusion of iron from the balls and the mill body in "face powder" is highly undesirable since such
