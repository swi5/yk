## Cost effectiveness with Concrete Recycling - Crete Crush
Cement contributes approximately 5% to 20% of concrete and is made by crushing and blending clay and limestone, which are materials with a content of oxides, calcium, silicon, aluminum and iron. This material blend is heated to about 1,500°C resulting in the formation of cement hydraulic materials, known as clinker, which irreversibly binds
