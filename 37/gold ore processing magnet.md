Next. Of all the methods of extracting gold & processing it from its ore, I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study. The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation, cyanidation and gravity concentration. Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.

Ore processing. Silver is commonly extracted from the powdered ore by smelting or chemical leaching. . This is done by dissolving a gold alloy (less than 30% gold) and boiling with 30% nitric acid. Affination is the process of boiling silver and gold with concentrated sulfuric acid. This separates the silver and gold.

Pure gold, also known as 24k gold, is not magnetic. If you have just purchased a 24k gold bar or ring and it attracts a magnet, you are in trouble because that product isn't pure gold. Other gold types, such as white gold, have a weak magnetic pull due to its small amount of added nickel or other hard metals.
