## Study on Natural Settlement Index Characteristics of Iron-Bearing 
The test results show that the iron ore tailings particles settle at an overall fast rate: basically, within 10 to 20 min they are able to reach or approach 85 to 99.5% of the final settling state-related index. During the settling process in the fixed container, at first, the clarified water at the top of the tailings slurry is very turbid.

Aug 17, 2022Japan uses flotation iron ore tailings and coal tailings as the main raw materials to make sewer clay pipes, and the Japanese Institute of Pollution Data has patented the use of them as lightweight porous material. China applies iron ore tailings to non-fired bricks, glass, glass-ceramics, fine concrete aggregates, and road bases.

Abstract: Iron tailing is a kind of mineral waste from industrial processing and magnetic separation of iron ore, which severely pollute the air, soil property and the source of water. For large scale tailing ponds (dam height >100 m), the accident could cause a substantial damage. Therefore, it is significant to appropriately utilize the tailings.

## Thermoplastic polyurethane composites based on iron tailings: An 
Sep 9, 2022The massive production and accumulation of industrial solid waste-iron tailings not only occupy valuable land resources but also easily cause environmental pollution and personnel injury. Based on this, the thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/modified iron tailings (MIT) composites were prepared by surface modification of iron tailings (MIT) and
