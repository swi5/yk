## Uses of Calcium Carbonate Limestone in Various Industries
It is used to remove impurities from steel and iron. The purification process of steel is usually cumbersome but calcium carbonate purifies iron from the resource, iron ore. Read this article to see the extensive use of the limestone in the construction and architecture industry.

## physical chemistry - Purity of calcium carbonate in limestone 
0. 150 m L of 0.1 N H C l is required to react with 1 g of a sample of limestone. Calculate percentage purity of calcium carbonate. Reaction: C a C O X 3 + 2 H C l C a C l X 2 + H X 2 O + C O X 2. Number of milli equivalence of H C l used initially is 15. Number of milli moles of H C l used initially is 15 2.
