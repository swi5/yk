## process of hemihydrate gypsum
Without gypsum, hydrated calcium aluminate crystallizes within about 10 min; gypsum retards this process by several hours or even days depending on the gypsum content. In the quality control of cement, it is therefore important to know the exact content of the CaSO4 dihydrate or hemihydrate.

## Study on the Kinetics of Hydration Transformation from Hemihydrate 
The key technology of wet process phosphoric acid recrystallization is phosphogypsum phase transformation. In this study, the hydration of α-hemihydrate phosphogypsum (α-HH) to dihydrate phosphogypsum (DH) and the influence of process parameters on hydration kinetics are performed by modifying a dispersive kinetic model in the simulation of wet process phosphoric acid recrystallization.

## process of hemihydrate gypsum
wallboard, gypsum must be partially dehydrated or calcined to produce calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO4 ½H 2O), commonly called stucco. A flow diagram for a typical gypsum process producing both crude and finished gypsum products is shown in Figure 11.16-1. In this process gypsum is crushed, dried, ground, and calcined.
