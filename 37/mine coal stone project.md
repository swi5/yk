The Project China Stone involves the construction and operation of a large-scale coal mine on a greenfield site in Central Queensland at the northern end of the Galilee Basin. The mine will produce up to 55 Million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of Run of Mine (ROM) coal, which equates to approximately 38 Mtpa of thermal coal for the export market.
