With the depleting reserves of high-grade iron ore in the world, froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate- and low-grade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market. In over half a century's practice in the iron ore industry, froth flotation has been established as an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore.

Magmatic segregation is an ore-forming process, in which the valuable minerals are concentrated by settling them out from cooling magma. Through the magmatic segregation process, one or more minerals are concentrated locally during the cooling of magma. The rocks that are formed as a result of magmatic segregation are called magmatic cumulates.
