## What is the compressive strength of solid concrete block?
Answer (1 of 2): As per IS : 2185 (Part I) - 1979, the min. average (of 8 samples) compressive strength is 5 MPa, with individual value not lesser than 4 MPa, Table 2 page 12 for type D(5.0). As per IS : 2185 (Part II) - 1983, (Light Wt.) the min. average (of 8 samples) compressive strength is

## Compressive Strength of Concrete Cylinders - The Constructor
The compressive strength of the concrete cylinder is one of the most common performance measures performed by the engineers in the structural design. Here, the compressive strength of concrete cylinders is determined by applying continuous load over the cylinder until failure occurs. The test is conducted on a compression-testing machine.
