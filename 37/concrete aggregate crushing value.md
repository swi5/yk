The aggregate Crushing Value Test is an important test to be performed on aggregate.The strength of aggregate parent rock is determined by preparing cylindrical shape specimens of size 25 mm in diameter and 25 mm in height.. This cylinder is subjected to compressive stress.Depending on the type of parent rock gives the different crushing values of aggregate as a compressive strength varying

## Concrete Aggregate Crushing Value-HN Mining Machinery Manufacturer
It is recommended that the crushing value of aggregate should be less than 30%. If it is more than 30 % then 10% finer aggregate is suggested to use. The aggregate whose crushing value is less than 30% can be used for cement concrete road. The aggregate whose crushing value is less than 40% can be used for wearing surface.
