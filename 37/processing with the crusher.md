The operator must pay close attention to the cone crusher lube system. A low pressure alarm will sound if there is an abnormally low oil pressure. If this alarm sounds, the crusher will shut down after a timed delay. If the crusher is allowed to operate longer than 2 minutes after the loss of oil pressure, serious damage to the crusher may result.
