Coal ash, also referred to as coal combustion residuals or CCRs, is produced primarily from the burning of coal in coal-fired power plants. Coal ash includes a number of by-products produced from burning coal, including: Fly Ash, a very fine, powdery material composed mostly of silica made from the burning of finely ground coal in a boiler.
