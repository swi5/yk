## Particle Size Distribution - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Particle size distribution (ASTM D-1921) Particle size distribution (PSD) is measured using a set of sieves stacked vertically with mesh sizes typically ranging from 100 mesh (150 microns) to 30 mesh (600 microns). A sample of material (typically 100 g) is shaken, vibrated, or tapped through the sieves for a fixed time period (typically 10 min

Particle size analysis of drilling muds and components. 12 September 2013. Contact sales. The performance of a drilling mud, or fluid, is affected by its particle size. The ideal particle size depends on the geological formation and the function required of the mud. This note describes how laser diffraction can analyze different mud types.

Single Particle Counter (SPC) was applied to in-depth analysis of the size distribution of bentonite particles after disaggregation. Samples that were taken from the middle of the batch were not shaken to avoid particle sedimentation, facilitating the analysis of the stable fractions (Degueldre et al., 2000).
