## BlastHole Drilling Introduction
In smaller holes, it is most common in softer rock formations. The drilling principle is to use a high pull down force (weight-on-bit), rotate the drill bit, and blow the rock cuttings to the surface with compressed air. Hardrock drills typically use the Rotary method to drill blastholes from 200 mm (7 7 /8") to 311 mm (12 ¼") diameter.
