Crushing in an impact crusher takes place when the stone is struck by the spinning impact bars, and by that stone being flung against an apron. When impact crushing is used, the striking of the aggregate by the spinning rotor's blow bars knocks off or breaks the elongated fractures. This process is repeated by an impactor in the secondary stage.

Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab. Adding a layer of crushed stone will add proper drainage, as well as create a barrier between your slab and the ground.
