## The working principle and characteristics of belt conveyor
Feb 19, 2021The belt conveyor is a conveyor belt that is supported by upper and lower rollers as a bearing member and a traction member. It bypasses the head and tail rollers to form a closed-loop conveyor. It transmits power by means of the friction between the driving roller and the conveyor belt. Realize material transportation.

## All About Vibrating Conveyors - Types, Design, and Uses - Thomasnet
The trough stroke, or one full movement of the trough, is usually twice the amplitude of the vibration and the goal for most vibrating conveyors is to minimize this amplitude but maximize frequency. These vibrating conveyors are often called "controlled" conveyors, as the frequency and amplitude can be exactly set and changed if need be.
