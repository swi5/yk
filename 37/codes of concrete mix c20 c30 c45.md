## conventional grade-c20-c25-c30-concrete mix ratio
The strength of concrete is divided into twelve grades such as C7.5, C10, C15, C20, C25, C30, C35, C40, C45, C50, C55 and C60. Concrete mix ratios are expressed in two ways: one is expressed in materials used per cubic meter of concrete (Water: Cement: Sand: Gravel), and the other is expressed as a ratio of various materials. for example, C:S:G

## Different Concrete Grades and What They Are Used For - Knight's Companies
C30 Concrete Grade. One of the lower strength commercial grades is C30. Also known as ST3 or PAV1, C30 grade is mostly used during pavement construction. C30 is designed to withstand 30 Newton/28 day strength and is strong enough to use in reinforced bases, any outside paved area, or other lighter external applications.

## Density of Concrete - Gross Density by Type of Concrete
There are basically only two variables to consider when ordering the concrete: the consistency and the concrete density. The consistency is also called the W / C value. This indicates the ratio between water and cement. The more fluid a fresh concrete, the easier it is to pour it into a mold.
