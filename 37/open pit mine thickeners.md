## Open-Pit Mining Characteristics - Mining-pedia
In metal open-pit mine, the ore loss rate is generally 3% ~ 5% and dilution rate is generally 5% ~ 8%. While in underground mining, the ore loss rate is generally 15% ~ 25% and dilution rate is 3% ~ 20%. Therefore, open pit mining is beneficial to the full recovery of mineral resources. Especially for some high-temperature, flammable and watery
