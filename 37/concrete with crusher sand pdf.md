##  Experimental Study on Concrete Using Sea Sand As Fine Aggregate - Ijser
2.3 Sand for Concrete. Liquid stone, or concrete as it is named, was invented before the first world war, but became popular in the  military bunkers, airfield tarmac and roads. Concrete is basically made from hard rock. Rock is broken (crushed) into small pieces (between 20 and 40mm maximally), then sieved (graded) into various size grades

## Can we use m-sand (crusher sand) for concrete instead of river sand 
Yes, M-Sand (crushed sand) can replace 100% river sand in a concrete mix proportion. M-Sand are manufactured by latest technology (Vertical shaft impactor nachines). They give at par results in comparison to rivers sand concrete mixes, in both fresh and hardened state. Since quality control is maintained in the process of preparing manufactured

The recommendation for over preparation is that the base material should extend past the paved edge an equal distance of the base depth. For example, if your patio is 20 feet by 10 feet and you are installing 6 inches of granular material as a base, then you must excavate an area 11 feet (10' + 6" + 6") by 21 feet (20' + 6" + 6").This works well for almost all paver applications
