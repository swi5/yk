## Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that, through cellular respiration, can later be released to fuel the organism's activities.Some of this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water - hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek

## How is sugar processed? - Sugar Nutrition Resource Centre
There are 3 stages to the production of sugar - growing, milling and refining. In both Australia and New Zealand table sugar comes from the sugar cane plant. Sugar is made in the leaves of the sugar cane plant by photosynthesis. During milling the cane is crushed to extract the juice. The juice is cleaned and concentrated into a syrup.

Dry Mill Ethanol Process. In dry milling, the entire grain kernel is first ground into "meal," then slurried with water to form a "mash.". Enzymes are added to the mash to convert starch to sugar. The mash is cooked, then cooled and transferred to fermenters. Yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to alcohol begins.
