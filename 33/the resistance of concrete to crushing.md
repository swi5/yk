##  Abrasive Wear Resistance of Concrete in Connection with the Use  - MDPI
Some studies show that good concrete resistance is ensured by using a higher strength class, i.e., using a higher dose of cement, the addition of active mineral additive and a low water-cement ratio [8-10]. Although these theories show positive results, the microstructure of the composite must be taken into account.

Interlocking bricks are the enhanced form of conventional clay bricks.Each brick is constructively designed to lock itself to the other bricks around without the use of mortar. The self-locking is achieved using shear-key and lock mechanism. Based on the design, the shape of shear-key will vary and a complimentary lock is provided on the opposite side of brick.

The strength of concrete is controlled by the proportioning of cement, coarse and fine aggregates, water, and various admixtures. The ratio of the water to cement is the chief factor for determining concrete strength. The lower the water-cement ratio, the higher is the compressive strength.

## Pole foam vs concreteysof64
Concrete strength also comes into play, but most slab concrete is around 3000 to 4000 psi, so it's not a major factor. The tensile strength of concrete is typically taken as 10 to 15% of the compressive strength, so only about 400 or 500 psi. Compare that to the tensile strength of Grade 60 rebar, which is 60,000 psi.

## blast resistance of concrete Topic
Blast resistance is the ability of a material to withstand blast pressure from an explosion. Blast resistance design involves determining the kind and degree of resistance a structure needs as well as how to specify the required materials and details. A structural element subjected to a blast loading exhibits a higher strength than a similar element subjected to a static loading.

Sep 14, 2020Recycled crushed concrete begins by breaking down original structures. This can include just about any of the normal concrete structures that would go into landfills, like building slabs, curbs, foundation, and any sort of concrete structure. The breakdown begins by using industrial crushing equipment to demolish the existing structure.

Abrasion resistance, in general, is difficult to define, but usually it means the loss of coating by rubbing or scraping. It is sometimes called "erosion." Marring is sometimes included as abrasion. It is the permanent deformation of a surface by something rubbing against it. The deformation does not break the surface.
