Syntactically, an aggregation framework query is an array of stages. A stage is an object description of how MongoDB should transform any document coming into the stage. The first stage feeds documents into the second stage, and so on, so you can compose transformations using stages. The array of stages you pass to the aggregate() function is

## aggregate query processing in wireless sensor network
Previous studies propose in-network aggregate query processing, in which sensor nodes use aggregate operators to reduce the number of messages, thereby conserving energy . When multiple aggregate queries are submitted to wireless sensor networks, it is possible to generate the intermediate results of these queries.

## Robust and Efficient Aggregate Query Processing in Wireless Sensor Networks
Wireless sensor networks have been widely used in many environmental monitoring applications [].In most of these applications, aggregate queries, such as SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE (AVG), MIN and MAX, are often used as statistics collected from sensors [12, 13, 22].However, it is known that data collected from sensors are often noisy for various reasons, such as sensing device noise, inaccuracies in

## Processing approximate aggregate queries in wireless sensor networks 
Processing approximate aggregate queries in wireless sensor networks - In-network data aggregation has been recently proposed as an effective means to reduce the number of messages exchanged in wireless sensor networks. Nodes of the network form an aggregation tree, in which parent nodes aggregate the values received from their children and propagate the result to their own parents.
