## Metallurgy
The earliest recorded metal employed by humans appears to be gold, which can be found free or "native".Small amounts of natural gold have been found in Spanish caves dating to the late Paleolithic period, 40,000 BC. Silver, copper, tin and meteoric iron can also be found in native form, allowing a limited amount of metalworking in early cultures. Certain metals, notably tin, lead, and at a

The ancient world leader in gold mining, Egypt, began to separate gold from other metals only in the 21st century BC. And products made of pure gold became in use after 12 centuries. At the same time, gold began to be in demand in the East. India and China also boast a centuries-old tradition of using gold in everyday life and the economy.

## Gold | Geoscience Australia
Native gold, R30017. Source: Geoscience Australia. Gold, like iron, copper, lead and tin is a metal. Gold is the only yellow metal and is chemically very stable. It does not readily combine with other substances and, therefore, does not corrode or tarnish. Because of this property, it is almost always found in nature as pure gold.

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

The lack of outstanding success in spite of the great increase in prospecting during the depression in the 1930's confirms the opinion of those most familiar with the occurrence of gold and the development of gold mining districts is that the best chances of success lie in systematic studies of known productive areas rather than in efforts to discover

To a casual observer, mining gold seems simple: find ore, extract it then process it into gold. However, this isn't the case since mining for gold is a more complex process which occurs in stages.. Before the precious metal can be extracted, firms are required to explore the area in order to accurately determine the size of the deposit and how the ore can be extracted and processed

Shaft Mining. Shaft mining is a form of underground mining where shafts are pushed vertically from top to bottom to excavate the ores and minerals. It is also called shaft sinking. It is best suited for concentrated minerals such as iron, coal, etc. which can be found at the depth of the earth's surface. It is found mostly all over the world.
