## Limonite
Limonite (/ ˈ l aɪ m ə ˌ n aɪ t /) is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as FeO(OH)· n H 2 O, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Limonite is one of the three principal iron ores, the others being hematite and magnetite

## Limonite: Mineral information, data and localities.
A Mixture Of: Goethite, Hematite, Hisingerite, Jarosite, Lepidocrocite, Maghemite. Currently used for unidentified massive hydroxides and oxides of iron, with no visible crystals, and a yellow-brown streak. 'Limonite' is most commonly the mineral species goethite, but can also consist of varying proportions of lepidocrocite, hisingerite

## Is Limonite Is Metallic Mineral.pl
Is limonite metallic or nonmetallic? Limonite is not a true mineral but a mixture of similar hydrated iron oxide minerals. Most of limonite is made up of Goethite. Massive Goethite and Limonite can be indistinguishable. Limonite forms mostly in or near oxidized iron and other metal ore deposits, and as sedimentary beds. Read More
