## Reducing Mercury Pollution from Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining 
Mercury has long been used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) to extract gold from ore sediment and rock deposits. ASGM accounts for more than a third (38%) of all anthropogenic mercury emissions to the atmosphere, with most ASGM sector-related mercury emissions coming from the burning of mercury-gold amalgam.
