The percentage passing 150 microns of manufactured sand is relaxed to 20% (while that of natural sand is limited to 10%). As per design and economics, crushed sand can be used to partially or fully replace river sand from a concrete mix. The Availability of crushed sand is not a concern as it can be manufactured from rocks in any season.

If the natural sand is not properly processed, at that point there will be harm in concrete at beginning period. Primary goals are to lower the cost of the building

## Crushed rock sand - An economical and ecological alternative to natural 
The admixture dosage was increased from 0 to 1% and the slump values were measured. The slump values for concrete manufactured using NS and 100% replacement with CRS were plotted ().The plots reveal that at low level of admixture dosage (upto 0.70%), the concrete manufactured using CRS as 100% fine aggregates has almost zero slump values.

## Manufactured Sand (M-Sand) for Concrete -Properties and Advantages
Manufactured sand (M-Sand) is a substitute of river sand for concrete construction . Manufactured sand is produced from hard granite stone by crushing. The crushed sand is of cubical shape with grounded edges, washed and graded to as a construction material. The size of manufactured sand (M-Sand) is less than 4.75mm.

##  Suitability of Crushed Manufactured Sand for Replacement of Natural 
C-25 concrete properties with partial replacement of river sand by manufactured sand. Independent variables • Percentage of manufactured sand. • Properties of fine and coarse aggregates. • Curing age of cubes. Research design The study was an experimental study of C-25 concrete properties with and without replacement of manufactured sand.
