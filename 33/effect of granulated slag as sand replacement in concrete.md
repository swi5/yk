## Properties of concrete incorporating fly ash and ground granulated 
Masonry works with mortar are generally made with cement, sand and water. In this study, mortar mixes were made by replacing the masonry cement with up to 50% of fly ash at an incremental rate of 10%. Six mortar mixes with 1:4 volumetric cement-to-aggregate ratios using natural sand were made and tested for flow and strength properties.

difference in the level of deicer scaling that occurred in slag cement concrete versus OPC concrete (Dubovoy, et al, 1986). Afrani and Rogers (1994), on the other hand, recorded much greater scaling loss for concrete with high slag cement replacement compared to 100% OPC concrete. Also noted was a difference in deicer scaling resistance apparently

Jan 1, 2021The physical properties and Standard value of OPC used in investigation are shown in Table 1. Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 shows sieve analysis of sand, Copper Slag, and Granite Dust and from this it can be interpret that granite dust is having lower fineness modulus than sand whereas copper slag is having more fineness modulus than sand. Result of the sieve analysis reveals that river sand, CS and
