The CharFuel Â® Coal Refining Process yields coproducts similar to crude oil refining, including gasoline, Jet-A fuel, green diesel, and heating oil, as well as petrochemicals such as benzene, toluene, and xylene at costs less than that of comprable petroleum products. Uses existing pipelines, tankers, and trains with no modification.

## Copper Mining & Extraction Process Flow Chart
The copper oxide minimum minerals are dissolved by the acid to give a blue copper rich solution mainly of copper sulfate. This solution is tapped off from the bottom of the pad and placed into big tanks with steel plates an electrical current is passed from the tank to the steel which is then electroplated with pure copper.

## Copper Extraction and Purification | ChemKey
Copper can be extracted from non-sulfide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulfuric acid to produce a very dilute copper (II) sulfate solution. Concentration of the copper (II) sulfate solution by solvent extraction.

## Refining platinumthoidaifo
Platinum group metals (PGM) are refined using highly sophisticated chemical methods that are particular to their composition. The use of the right compounds, as well as the chemical reactions that occur, makes it easier to separate PGM from other elements that may be attached. Refining is the process of purifying an impure metal in metallurgy.

## Copper Extraction - W3schools
Copper metal is extracted from molten matte by a process called bessemerization. The matte is introduced into Bessemer converter which upholds by tuyers. The air is blown through the molten matte. A blast of hot air converts Cu 2 S into Cu 2 O which then reacts with remaining Cu 2 S to give molten copper with some impurity in the mixture.

## copper extraction and purification - chemguide
Copper can be extracted from non-sulphide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulphuric acid to produce a very dilute copper (II) sulphate solution. Concentration of the copper (II) sulphate solution by solvent extraction.

## nickel processing - Extraction and refining | Britannica
The extraction of nickel from ore follows much the same route as copper, and indeed, in a number of cases, similar processes and equipment are used. The major differences in equipment are the use of higher-temperature refractories and the increased cooling required to accommodate the higher operating temperatures in nickel production.

As the molten copper cools, it gives off the dissolved of SO 2. The SO 2 gas escaping in the form of bubbles, leaves the surface of the metal with full of cavities which gives the metal a blistered appearnace. This is why the metal thus obtained is by blister copper. 4. Refining of Copper. Copper is refined using electrorefining method.

## An Exergetic Comparison of Copper Extraction from Chalcopyrite 
Copper is an essential metal in today's economy, due to its superior electrical and thermal conductivities, alloying properties, and chemical uses. Most copper is produced viamining and refining, and most copper is found in the earth's crust as chalcopyrite, CuFeS2. Typically, chalcopyrite is concentrated and fed to a high temperature pyrometallurgical process which produces >99.99% purity
