## Graphite Properties and Characteristics - Entegris
Thermodynamically, graphite at atmospheric pressure is the more stable form of carbon. Diamond is transformed to graphite above 1500°C (2732°F), Figure 1-4. The structure of graphite consists of a succession of layers parallel to the basal plane of hexagonally linked carbon atoms. The ideal graphite structure is shown in Figure 1-5.

## Compressive Strength Of Iron Ores Nigeria
Graphite Ore Compressive Crushing Strength. Graphite cast iron is said to be about 3 times than the tensile strength. The pearlite matrix compressive stress is about Nmm2 and the compressive strength of the ferrite matrix is about Nmm2 4 5.
