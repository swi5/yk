A process and system for producing tantalum or other valve metal particles is provided comprising forming tantalum particles in a reduction process carried out in a reactor vessel, and using a siphon to transfer fine tantalum particles out of the reaction mixture to a recovery vessel. This particle transfer can occur while the reaction mixture is agitated.

The particle size of gold in the ore is supposed to be very fine. It can be observed that most of the gold particles are below 10um, and more than 86% of the gold particles are less than 0.02mm. Therefore, the raw ore is a very refractory metallurgical ore with slight to ultra refined arsenic and carbon.

The recovery of silicates and clay minerals was exacerbated by their free, fine-, or ultrafine nature (Figure 9 and Figure 10). Grain size distribution data obtained via QEMSCAN analysis revealed that the silicate gangue minerals have a combined P 80 < 25 µm, making them susceptible to mechanical recovery, which was undesirable.
