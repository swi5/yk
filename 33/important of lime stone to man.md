Limestone is a sedimentary rock comprising about 15% of the earth's sedimentary crust. Limestones are generally mined in the method of open pit mining and underground mining based on the economic and environmental conditions. Surface limestone mining. All over the world, the limestones are generally mined from a quarry or the open pit mining.

It doesn't hurt that limestone is relatively easy to work. Lots of societies have used limestone as their go-to stone for masonry, reserving harder-to-work stones like marble and basalt for special purposes.

If we are mixing higher amount of Limestone then we get high amount of Calcium Oxides (CaO). It will help to desulfurize higher Sulfur or Sulfur dioxides (SO ₂). So it is most important to know the amount of Calcium Oxides (CaO) present in the lime stone that we are using. Lower the Calcium Oxides (CaO) will increases the Lime stone consumption.
