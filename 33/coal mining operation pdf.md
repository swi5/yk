Coal Mining-Methods. Mining Methods Coal is mined by two main methods surface or opencast mining and underground mining.. The choice of method is largely determined by the geology of the coal deposit; the majority of the world's coal reserves are recoverable by underground mining. The method used is determined by the depth of coal deposit and the overburden over it.

Underground mining is generally more complicated than surface mining and the hazards to the miners are greater. About 75 percent of all coal mining fatalities occurred in underground mines. The U.S. Bureau of Mines identifies roof falls as the number one killer in coal mining (see Figure 1.1). More than 40 percent of the fatalities

•Mine Operation: the day-to-day running of the mine to maintain regular coal production; •Decommissioning:the dismantling of mining operations, once the mineable resource is exhausted, and the return of the land to other forms of use. None of these is independent of any other, and the geology of the deposit is significant to all of them.

Surface mining is used to produce most of the coal in the U.S. because it is less expensive than underground mining. Surface mining can be used when the coal is buried less than 200 feet underground. In surface mining, giant machines remove the top-soil and layers of rock to expose large beds of coal. Once the mining is finished,
