## What is the Average Household Water Pressure? (Updated: 2022)
Most households have an inlet water pressure of 40-45 PSI (pounds per square inch). A standard household shouldn't exceed 80 PSI, as this could damage your plumbing, fixtures and appliances, including your water heater. This is why a plumber will usually regulate a household's water pressure to about 50 PSI.

By starting the outdoor line with a narrow pipe you are starting your entire system with a lot less water than you could have. Simply switching from a 3/4-inch hose to a 5/8-inch hose will decrease the volume of water flow by around 30%, now imagine that your supply line to your hose bib is only a 1/2-inch PVC pipe.
