## The Process of Manufacturing Aggregate | K&B Crushers
After the natural materials are gathered, the aggregate is processed, screened and washed to remove any unwanted coatings or chemicals. When processing, aggregates are fed through a primary crusher which will reduce the size of the concrete into chunks.
