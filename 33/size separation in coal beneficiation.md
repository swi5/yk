Flotation, with the "Sub-A" gravity flow principle, provides the ideal way to treat coal fines even as coarse as —3/16" top size. According to reports from plants operating for the production of metallurgi­cal coke, each percent ash in the coal carries a penalty of 2$ per ton of coal.

## Energies | Free Full-Text | Proposal for an Improvement of Hard Coal 
Until now, many models and methods of coal separation have been used, for example gravity separation, centrifugal separation, and electrostatic separation [10,11,12,13,14,15]. Secondary enrichment systems are known in the theory and technology of mineral resource processing, but in the case of coal beneficiation, they are used relatively rarely

Oct 5, 2020The dry separation methods for coal beneficiation have been regaining attention in the past decades. A number of improved or newly designed devices have been developed—one of them is a negative pressure pneumatic separator (NPPS). The said method of separation is based on the differences in the physical properties between coal and gangue minerals, such as the grain density, size, and shape.

Electrostatic beneficiation can work effectively for fine coal particles in the size range of 1 mm {times} 0. As a dry process, electrostatic separation has many advantages over wet processes, notably: the ability to operate in areas where water resources are scarce, and no need for dewatering the processed coal.

## Coal Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Currently, the wet coal beneficiation process is the predominant method for coal upgrading. The wet beneficiation processes include heavy media separation, cyclone (water only), froth flotation, and spiral separation [23,24]. The use of these technologies depends on the particle size of the feed and the quality of the product required.
