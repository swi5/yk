In metallurgy refining of metals is the final process.Once the extraction process is complete we must ensure that the metal is free of any impurities. If you remember we have done a similar process before of removing impurities during concentration of ores. However, in the refining process, the chemical composition of the metal will remain..

## Copper Ore Dressing Process In Chile
The Proccess Of Copper Ore Dressing Because average copper grades of copper sulphide ores in Chile have decreased from 1.18 to 0.90 over the period 2003e2012 (Cochilco, 2012), greater consumption of water, energy and chem-ical reagents is required to efﬁciently process low-grade copper sulphide ores.

## Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Beneficiation is followed by processing activities such as smelting and refining. The beneficiation process begins with milling, which is followed by flotation for further beneficiation. At the first stage, extracted ores undergo the milling operation to produce uniformly sized particles for crushing, grinding, wet or dry concentration.

## Beneficiation Methods of Copper Nickel Sulfide Ore
The ore types of copper-nickel sulfide ore are mainly magmatic-melted copper-nickel ore. When the nickel content is more than 3 %, it is rich and can be directly smelted. When the nickel content is less than 3 %, it needs beneficiation treatment. When the nickel ore content is less than 3 %, it is mainly accompanied by a large number of metal minerals and gangue minerals.
