## Dust collector blew out while grinding concrete in basement. Paranoid 
As the title suggests, had a bit of a disaster early this week. Was grinding some concrete in the basement (respirator, entrances masked, dust collection, etc). I had the dust collector piped to a bag outside and it was doing fine, but while working it blew out at the exhaust and was spewing dust back into the room.

Often when working with hard materials, such as brick or concrete, a wet grinder or saw can be used to dampen the dust - but again, working inside is entirely different. We work using dust control systems.
