After that crushing is done in the usual way. the cube can be tested after 3, 7, 14 and 28 days. cube is placed in compression testing machine and axial load is applied at the rate of 140 kg cm2. in actual concrete is required sufficient time to gain strength. usually 28 days strength is considered as the full strength of concrete.

So, 100mmx100mmx100mm concrete cubes are used in place of 150mmx150mmx150mm cubes to raise the used stress to crush the concrete cubes. For normal concrete strength, the cube size of 150mmx150mmx150mm is already sufficient for the crushing strength of the machine.

Concrete test cube manufacturing and curing procedures, Know More. The cube strength of concrete is specifi ed by a structural engineer and is assessed by crushing concrete cubes at a specifi ed age 28 days after casting Early strength may also be assessed at 3 or 7 days after casting The preparation, handling, curing and testing of concrete cubes are done according to SANS 5861-3 2006
