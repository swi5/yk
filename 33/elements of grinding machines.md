Grinding machines work without tools: all they need is the corresponding abrasive medium, such as types of paper and textiles with an abrasive surface. Grinding stones are also used and consist of a pressed and fired abrasive medium - mostly quartz sand. The finer the abrasive medium, the less surface that will be removed per grinding cycle.
