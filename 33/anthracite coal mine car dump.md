## Anthracite Heritage: Landscape, Memory and the Environment
Historian John Bodner (1983, 11) wrote, "No other American industry inflicted more heedless destruction on men and the environment than anthracite mining." The decline of the anthracite coal industry has left the region with relatively high unemployment rates and people are migrating out of the region at an alarming rate.
