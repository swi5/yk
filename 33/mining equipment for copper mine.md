## Copper Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
The Basics of Copper Mining and Processing Mined from open pits, copper ore must be crushed as part of the process that occurs between extraction and production. Using today's compact mining equipment, copper ore is extracted from the mine. After the ore is crushed, it's roasted, which helps to convert sulfides to oxides.

In each of these mining methods, various earth-moving equipment including shovels, dozers, hauling trucks, and loaders are used to remove and transport the ore. However, the first step is to loosen the rock in the ore body so that it can be moved and processed. Blasting and grinding equipment are used to accomplish this task.

Using today's compact mining equipment, copper ore is extracted from the mine. After the ore is crushed, it's roasted, which helps to convert sulfides to oxides. The oxides are smelted to produce matte, which then undergoes several refining processes. What is Copper Used For? Water Pipes Wiring Coins Electronics Cookware Jewelry Ornaments Roofing

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
Copper mining is usually performed using open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the earth over time. To remove the ore, boring machinery is used to drill holes into the hard rock, and explosives are inserted into the drill holes to blast and break the rock.
