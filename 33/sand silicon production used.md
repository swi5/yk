Natural silica sand has a sub-angular to a rounded shape, making them an ideal filtration media to capture suspended solids in water. Due to high silica content, sand is durable and hard-wearing, allowing it to be graded precisely to facilitate efficient filtering. These grades include 16/30, 8/16, 6/14, and 14/25, 20/40,18/8, 2/4,3/6, 6/13, 13

An overabundance of silica is used to prevent formation of silicon carbide. Microsilica is a useful byproduct. A mineral perryite is similar to ferrosilicon, with its composition Fe 5 Si 2. In contact with water, ferrosilicon may slowly produce hydrogen. The reaction, which is accelerated in the presence of base, is used for hydrogen production.
