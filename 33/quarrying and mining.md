## Mining and Quarrying Impacts | Encyclopedia
Mining and quarrying involve investigating potential sites of extraction, then getting the required material out of the ground, and finally processing with heat or chemicals to get out the metal or other substance of interest. All these operations may use large amounts of water. Mining and quarrying can be very destructive to the environment.

## Quarrying of Stones: Its Methods, Selection of Site  - CivilSeek
It differs from the mining of ores of metals in that whereas quarrying is an operation carried out entirely on the surface, mining involves digging below the ground, sometimes at considerable depth.. A quarry is a place where different types of stones are extracted.

The quarrying process consists of separating large blocks, sometimes called loafs, from the surrounding rock. These blocks may be 6 metres high by 6 metres deep and 12 to 18 metres (about 40 to 60 feet) long, and they may weigh in the range of 1,200 to 2,000 tons. (Such large blocks are subsequently divided into mill blocks weighing 15 to 70 tons.)
