Dec 15, 2021 · The average cost of a concrete slab (6 inches thick) is $5.00-5.50 per square foot, including materials and labor. However, the price can go up to $9-10 per square foot depending on numerous factors and enhancement costs. Thus, your cost to pave a 2-car driveway of 16 feet wide, and 40 feet long (640 sq.ft.) will be about $3,200 - 3,520..

## How to Calculate Cement bags per Cubic meter Concrete?
We already discussed the volume formula from Concrete Volume Calculation which is. Required Cement Quantity for 1 m3 = (Cement Part / Total Parts) x 1.55 = 1/ (1+2+4) x 1.55 = 0.221 m3. Unit weight of cement = 1440 kg / m3. Therefore required cement = 1440 x 0.221 m3 = 318.24 Kg or (318.24/50) = 6.37 Bags.
