Approximately 95% of the organic matter in the sedimentary rock is found in shale or mud. Shale is created by a process called compression. The shale exposed to extreme heat and pressure may vary in slate form. Once formed, the shale is usually released into lakes and rivers with slow-moving water. Clay is an important component in shale rocks.

## Run on Ammonia: Shale Gas Drives Fertilizer Projects in the US
Ammonia is in demand: The boom of biofuels, emerging economies, a growing population and dietary improvements in many regions drive the demand for this raw material. With this perspective and the abundance of cheap shale gas, fertilizer Projects boom in the US a new study says. According to a new IHS special market study, growing incomes and

## Expanded shale vs perlite
The expanded material is a brilliant white, due to the reflectivity of the trapped bubbles. Unexpanded ("raw") perlite has a bulk density around 1100 kg/m 3 (1.1 g/cm 3), while typical expanded perlite has a bulk density of about 30-150 kg/m 3 (0.03-0.150 g/cm 3). Typical analysis. 70-75% silicon dioxide: SiO 2; 12-15% aluminium oxide . The expanded material is a brilliant white
