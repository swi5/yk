## Nickel Carbonate | AMERICAN ELEMENTS
Nickel Carbonate is a water insoluble Nickel source that can easily be converted to other Nickel compounds, such as the oxide by heating (calcination). Carbonate compounds also give off carbon dioxide when treated with dilute acids. Nickel Carbonate is generally immediately available in most volumes.

They are primarily driven by supply, demand and energy prices. In 2019, prices of pure Nickel were at around 77 $/kg. Nickel is extracted by roasting to NiO and then reducing with carbon. The Mond process is used to manufacture pure nickel, in which impure nickel reacts with carbon monoxide (CO) to form Ni (CO)4, which is then decomposed at 200

1 Description of nickel ore. The laterite nickel ore is complex in composition and can be roughly divided into two types: limonite type and silicon magnesium-nickel type. The main elements are nickel, cobalt and manganese. The laterite mining method generally uses open-pit mining. The ore body generally does not require rock drilling or blasting.

Nickel is very strong and resistant to corrosion, making it excellent for strengthening metal alloys. It is also very ductile and malleable, properties that allow its many alloys to be shaped into wire, rods, tubes, and sheets. History Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt first extracted pure nickel in 1751, but it was known to exist much earlier.

## Chromite | Chromium Ore, Properties, Uses and Occurrence
It occurs as layers in a few igneous rocks that are especially rich in iron and magnesium. Almost pure chromite is found in similar layers in sedimentary rocks. The layers are preserved when the sedimentary rocks metamorphose to form serpentinite. Referred to as chromitites, these rocks are the most important ores of chromium.

## Nickel
Nickel is a silvery-white metal with a slight golden tinge that takes a high polish. It is one of only four elements that are magnetic at or near room temperature; the others are iron, cobalt and gadolinium.Its Curie temperature is 355 °C (671 °F), meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.
