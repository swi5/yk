## What Are the Differences Between The 7 Types of Crushers?
For gyratory crusher, the outer circle represents the stationary bowl covered by the concave and the inner circle represents the main shaft covered by the mantle. The main shaft rests in the eccentric bushing at the base of the crusher. As the eccentric rotates, the base of the main shaft moves in a circular path around the crusher centerline.

The exact crushers you need—jaw, cone, impact, or gyratory—will depend on your site, the product you're making, and how much you need to produce. An individual crusher's construction and capabilities also dictate where in your processing operations it will fit.

## Cone Crusher | Working Principle | Animation | Engineering Intro
Cone crusher and gyratory crusher work on the same principle. Both have the same operation. If cone crusher differs then it is only from crushing chamber. Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones. It breaks the rocks by squeezing it between the gyrating spindles.

In a gyratory crusher, a round moving crushing surface is located within a round hard shell which serves as the stationary surface. The crushing action is created by the closing the gap between the hard crushing surface attached to the spindle and the concave liners (fixed) mounted on the main frame of the crusher.

Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and further developed by Gates in 1881 (they were commonly referred to as a 'Gate's crushers' in the early years). A primary crusher is designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines. Gyratory crushers typically crush to reduce the size of aggregate to a maximum

## Cone engineering vs british customs
With the Cones coming it at about $140 cheaper than BC for the shorty, I'm not sure what drives anyone to the preds outside of brand allegiance or just not knowing about Cone.There's no advantage to the BCs, even if I love them as a company. Looks like you save about $50 with the long Cones vs BC.

A gyratory crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. Gyratory crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing. Major components can be divided to ease transport

Gyratory crushers work on the same principle as cone crushers (Figure 4.4(c)). These have a gyratory motion driven by an eccentric wheel. These machines will not accept materials with a large particle size and therefore only jaw or impact crushers should be considered as primary crushers. Gyratory and cone crushers are likely to become jammed

A gyratory crusher uses a mantle that gyrates, or rotates, within a concave bowl. As the mantle makes contact with the bowl during gyration, it creates compressive force, which fractures the rock. The gyratory crusher is mainly used in rock that is abrasive and/or has high compressive strength.
