The mining property and plant are now owned by Certain Teed Company. A local company, Highland Gypsum Company, operated a small mine near the community of Highland in Pike County. The mine's output was used locally as a cement additive. The Highland mine was purchased by C. W. Harrison of Oklahoma and is now closed and reclaimed.

## Does gypsum add calcium to soileneration.pl
Gypsum aids in breaking up compacted soil .  This mineral can add calcium to the soil more quickly because it is more soluble than a lime material. Gypsum as the sulfur source tends to be less soluble than other sources such as ammonium sulfate.  Due to the lack of calcium in the field, it has a negative effect on the crops.

Gypsum is a hydrated sulphate of calcium, found usually in clays and limestone, sometimes associated with sulphur. It is the principal commercial form of hydrated calcium sulphate (CaSO42H2O). It is usually formed by either the evaporation of salt in shallow inland seas or by the decomposition of pyrite (FeS) in the presence of calcium carbonate.
