In Mineral Processing Design and Operations (Second Edition), 2016. 5.1 Introduction. Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and developed by Gates around 1881 and were referred to as a Gates crusher [1].The smaller form is described as a cone crusher. The larger crushers are normally known as primary crushers as they are designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly

Gyradisk Cone Crusher. For finer size products (e.g., -6 mm), a special cone crusher known as the Gyradisc is commonly used. Operation is similar to the Standard Cone Head; however, breakage is mostly by attrition rather than impact. Reduction ratio is around 8:1. Feed size is limited to less than 50 mm with a nip angle between 25 ° and 30 °.

From the discussion so far it is obvious that two energy factors determine a crusher's productivity: (1) Total power drawn affects the quantity produced of any given size or range of sizes. (2) The energy applied, previously defined as the crusher's Power Rate (kilowatt-hours per ton of feed) will determine the size reduction.

## single toggle jaw crusher working principle Sandvik OUTER SPACING RING 
Crushers - All crusher types for your reduction needs. There are two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher, an eccentric shaft is on the top of the crusher. Shaft rotation causes, along with the toggle plate, a compressive action. A double toggle crusher has two shafts and two toggle plates.
