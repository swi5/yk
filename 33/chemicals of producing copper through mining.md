## Copper Smelting Chemistry Tutorial - AUS-e-TUTE
A typical copper ore contains between 0.5% and 2.0% copper. A high grade ore produces a high yield of metal. A low grade order produces a low yield of metal. Copper can be extracted from sulfide ores (usually higher grade ores) by direct smelting. The earliest evidence of copper smelting occurs in Serbian artefacts dating from around 5000 BC.

In the case of copper, most of the world's reserves are in the form of chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2). The importance of chalcopyrite to copper production has led to extensive extraction research. An alternative method of producing copper from copper oxides and secondary sulfides utilizes heap leaching, solvent extraction, and electrowinning.

Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

2 days agoCopper is also made into alloys with other metals. Combined with zinc, it makes brass. Mixed with tin and zinc, it creates bronze. Copper is also a necessity for human health; we need a daily supply of this mineral. People get their dietary copper through things like seafood and other meats, whole grains, nuts, raisins, and even chocolate.
