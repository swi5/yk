While the ballast and ties also play a very important role within the track structure, without the rails, of course, trains could not operate. Throughout the decades and centuries railroad track technology has gradually improved with the most important advancement coming in the development of "T"-rail in the mid-19th century.

CMQ. October 6, 2017 - The traditional three-part recipe for a railroad - rock, creosote-soaked hardwood ties, and ribbons of steel rail - has remained essentially unchanged since the first iron horse was put to work. And just as ties and rails require maintenance and eventual replacement, the rock, known as ballast, also wears down, and out.

Try to keep the ballast slightly below the top of the ties, especially on the mainline. You can bury the ties in some spots on a siding or lesser used track as in the photo above. Soak the ballast grains with a mixture of 50/50 white glue or matte medium and alcohol. Use water if you're comfortable doing so.

## railway track ballast stone type
Track ballast (usually crushed stone), as it is known, is another important part of railroad infrastructure. Although it may just look like plain ole gravel this stone plays a vital role in acting as a support base for the railroad ties and rails as well as allowing for proper drainage of water away from the rails (which is why the stone is always sloped downward and away from track).

## Track ballast
Track ballast forms the trackbed upon which railroad ties (sleepers) are laid. It is packed between, below, and around the ties. It is used to bear the load from the railroad ties, to facilitate drainage of water, and also to keep down vegetation that might interfere with the track structure. Ballast also holds the track in place as the trains roll over it.

It provides to some extent elastic bed for the track. It transmits and distributes the load from the sleepers to formation uniformly.
