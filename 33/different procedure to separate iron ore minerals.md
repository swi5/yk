## Iron Ore: Sedimentary Rock - Pictures, Definition & More - Geology
Earth's most important iron ore deposits are found in sedimentary rocks. They formed from chemical reactions that combined iron and oxygen in marine and fresh waters. The two most important minerals in these deposits are iron oxides: hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ). These iron ores have been mined to produce almost every iron and

## Ore Minerals : What are Ore Minerals? - Geology Page
An ore is a natural occurrence of rock or sediment which contains enough minerals with economically important elements, typically metals, that can be extracted from the deposit economically. The ores are extracted by mining for a profit from the earth; they are then refined (often by smelting) in order to extract the valuable elements.
