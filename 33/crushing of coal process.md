## Selective Crushing of Run-of-Mine as an Important Part of the Hard Coal 
To obtain commercial product of required quantitative and qualitative parameters, hard coal must be subjected to a number of processing operations. Preliminary stone removal from run-of-mine is one of them. Methods of such removal, including the method of selective crushing are described. Design solutions for a KOMAG-type device for dry stone removal of run-of-mine are presented.

The ultimate goal of the crushing process is to reduce the size of the ore received from the mine (known as run-of-mine or ROM ore). The crushing process is the first step in comminution.
