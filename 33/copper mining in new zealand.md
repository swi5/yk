The primary copper mineralisation is pyrite and chalcopyrite, with minor sphalerite, pyrrhotite, and barite. (Read, 1986) notes carbonate-cyanotrichite, posnjakite, and langite in the deposit, uncommon species for New Zealand. Hematite boulders containing copper was found in a creek (now named Copper Mine Creek) by settlers looking for lost cattle.

In 1870 when James Hector, the director of the New Zealand Geological Survey, described the minerals and mining industry in New Zealand, gold, silver, copper, lead and iron had all been discovered, and small-scale mining was under way. Occurrences of chromium, zinc, antimony and other minerals were known.
