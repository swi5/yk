## Some Problems in the Crushing and Grinding Stage of Mineral Processing
Therefore, the ultimate development goal of the grinding operation is to obtain the highest mineral liberation degree with the minimum energy input. Selective grinding is widely used in mineral processing industry such as metal ore, non-metal ores and coal mines, especially in the molybdenum ore processing.

## Mineral Processing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The processing of lithium-containing minerals such as spodumene, in general, comprises crushing, wet grinding in a ball mill, sizing, gravity concentration, and flotation using a fatty acid (oleic acid) as the collector. The major lithium mineral in lithium ore is spodumene, which is considered insoluble in water and dilute acids.

## Process control challenges and opportunities in mineral processing
The mineral content can double in a matter of minutes, changing the flow characteristics dramatically. The processes are complex, with many circulating loads. The operator not only has to think of what is coming, but also what is coming back. Grinding typically has two recirculating streams and flotation can have as many as 10.

Mill (grinding) A mill is a device, often a structure, machine or kitchen appliance, that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding, crushing, or cutting. Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes. There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.

OMMINUTION BY GRINDING. In the mineral processing chain, the ﬁrst step is to separate ore from an ore-body either in an open pit or an underground mine. This ore is crushed to reduce the size of the rock and then transported to a concentrator plant where the ore is ground down to a suitable particle size for the subsequent concentrating steps.

## Energy Use of Fine Grinding in Mineral Processing | SpringerLink
F ine grinding is becoming an increasingly common unit operation in mineral processing. While fine grinding can liberate ores that would otherwise be considered untreatable, it can entail high costs in terms of energy consumption and media use. These costs can be minimized by performing adequate test work and selecting appropriate operating

Grinding is used to primarily liberate useful minerals and secondarily provide fine ores with a proper particle size for separation. Gaudin [ 9] developed a mineral liberation model for breakage, but it considered materials only as cubes of equal volumes in an excessively simplified mineral mosaic relation.
