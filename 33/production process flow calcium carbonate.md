## Ground Calcium Carbonate Manufacturing Process
Ground calcium carbonate (GCC) is mechanically crushed and classified, and its particles are mostly in irregular shapes such as cubes, polygons and cuboids. According to its original particle size, it is divided into coarse ground calcium carbonate (>3 µm), fine ground calcium carbonate (1-3 µm) and ultra fine ground calcium carbonate (0.5-1

## Calcium Carbonate Production
Calcium carbonate particularly used for making Portland cement, lime and gastric antacid. It is energetic element in agricultural lime which is created by combine reaction of calcium ions in hard water with carbonate ions. Calcium carbonate is used in paints and coating application and in cement for constructing and building industry.

significant loss of production and ultimately leads to shut down of production  on calcium carbonate deposition studies, but most of these studies have been on understanding calcium carbonate bulk precipitation process. However, little attention have been  6.1.2 The effect of flow rates on calcium carbonate surface deposition
