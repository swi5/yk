##  Iron Ore production in the Pilbara - Rio Tinto
Activities involved in finding, mining and processing iron ore at our Pilbara operations have been simplified in the following diagram. Rio Tinto operates 11 iron ore mines in the Pilbara and the specific sequence of activities varies from mine to mine. Excellence in planning, scheduling and quality control are fundamental to the process.

The extraction of iron ore involves surface (open-pit) or underground mining techniques (please refer to Chapter 7 (Stace, 2015) on Iron Ore Extraction Techniques). The LCA boundary used in this study is shown in Figure 20.4.The mining method selected depends on a variety of factors, including the nature and location of the deposit and the size, depth, and grade of the deposit.

Mining iron ore is a high-volume, low-margin business, as the value of iron is significantly lower than base metals.  The second method involves oxidizing the phosphorus during the fining process by adding iron oxide. This technique is usually associated with puddling in the 19th century, and may not have been understood earlier.

How is iron extracted from the earth? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing.

The obtained iron ore materials are moved to flotation desulfurization process, then to weak magnetic separation. The obtained product is iron ore concentrate. And low iron content material is discharged as tailings. You will also obtain sulphide concentrate as by-product through flotation desulfurization.

First, we explore the geology of the region to find the best iron ore prospects for our mining operations. Once the ideal site has been chosen, the ore is drilled and blasted.  while reducing the greenhouse gas emissions footprint of the production process itself. The ramp up of the US$3.6 billion South Flank iron ore mine, in Western
