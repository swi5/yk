The described tests were performed on so called "Neuhauser Granite". This granite is composed of 27 % quartz, 53 % feldspar and 20 % micas. Single minerals can be up to 4 mm in size. The texture is granular with some xenomorphic crystals. The rock shows a uniaxial compressive strength of 210 MPa and a Cerchar abrasivity index of 4.2.

To achieve the right effect, cut the slab according to the measurements you took at the hardware store. The cutting ought to be done on the stone surface area with an edge following the line of the counter top. Cut the slab as vast as the area you desire for new counters, however remember that you do not want any extra size on the ends.
