## Smelting Reduction Processes | SpringerLink
Iron ore fines, coal and fluxes are injected directly into the melt in the smelt reduction vessel. The process uses iron ore fines directly with non-coking coal (50-70% fixed carbon, 10-38% volatile matter and 5-12% ash; less than 10% ash is preferred). A thick slag layer is situated above the metal bath.

## The Ironmaking Process | New Zealand Steel
This has eventuated because of the nature of the ore mined locally and used in the process. Early pioneering experiments failed to successfully smelt iron from New Zealand's west coast ironsand deposits because the magnetite ore (Fe 3 O 4), as it is known, is locked in with minerals such as titania and silica. These bonded oxide impurities are

## Iron Smelting | Essential Humanities
Most iron ore contains some form of iron oxide (e.g. Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4). 3 In order to extract iron from iron ore,  The extraction of metal from an oxide ore is accomplished via smelting, a process in which ore is mixed with some form of carbon fuel (e.g. charcoal) in a low-oxygen chamber. Normally, the combustion of carbon is described by:

## When smelting iron ore?f
What is the process of smelting iron ore? Smelting involves heating up ore until the metal becomes spongy and the chemical compounds in the ore begin to break down.  Carbon and carbon monoxide combine with the oxygen in the iron ore and carry it away, leaving iron metal. In a bloomery, the fire doesn't get hot enough to melt the iron completely.

Using the ancient "bloomery" method, iron ore was converted directly into wrought iron by heating the ore while at the same time melting the ore's impurities and squeezing them out with hand hammers. This is also called the "direct process." By the 1100s water-powered hammers replaced hand hammers for forging out bars of iron.

Iron Bloomery - The most basic process used from the iron-age to medieval times. Charcoal, iron ore and air are combined to smelt an iron "bloom". The iron bloom is forged and worked to the final "Wrought Iron" shape. During the iron-age, bloomery furnaces rapidly replaced open charcoal fires as an effective way to forge.

Reduction consisted in gradual deoxidization of ferrous oxides contained in ore until metallic Fe was obtained. Reducer or an agent absorbing oxygen was ferrous oxide coming from the process of burning charcoal. Practically the process was conducted as follows. Through the mouth of a shaft layers of ore and charcoal were alternately fed.

With our ore mined and our charcoal made, we are almost ready to get to our smelting, but first we have one final step to prepare our iron ore for the smelting process: roasting. Roasting solves two problems we have. The first problem is water: our ore, even if it appears dry, almost certainly traps small amounts of water inside the ore.

Once broken into smaller pieces, the charcoal and iron ore (sand) are mixed together in a 1:1 ratio. 4. Charge the furnace. Before adding the iron ore and charcoal mixture, the furnace must be charged. Charging a furnace simply means heating it up to temperatures high enough for smelting to occur.

Answer (1 of 2): Smelting is a process used to extract pure metals from their ores. The metals in the mineral ore are already oxidized as metal ions such as Fe2+ or Fe3+. So to convert them back to their metallic form they must be reduced (gain electrons). Reducing agents, often charcoal or coke

## Iron Ore Smelting Process - Bright Hub Engineering
The ore is loaded into a blast furnace along with measured quantities of coke and limestone. Hot combustion air is supplied to the furnace and some form of fuel used to raise the temperature. The iron is reduced from the ore by carbon in the coke, the limestone aiding slag separation from the molten iron. The slag and molten iron are tapped off from the bottom of the furnace, the slag being

## Direct Iron Ore Smelting Process for Ironmaking - IspatGuru
Direct iron ore smelting (DIOS) process is a smelting reduction process for the production of hot metal (liquid iron). It is a two-stage process which has been developed in Japan. It uses non-coking coal in a powder or granular form to smelt iron ore fines into liquid iron (hot metal) and hence, there is no necessity of a coke ovens plant and a
