## What are the Basics for Belt Conveyors Presentation - JMS
A belt conveyor receives product on an inlet or impact area. The material remains static on the belt as the belt itself moves and conveys the material to the discharge point, unlike screw conveyors where the material is mixing and turning while the screw conveys the material. This screw conveyor mixing action can lead to some material property

Covers protect the carcass of the belt from load abrasion and any other conditions that could contribute to belt deterioration. The top and bottom covers of the conveyor belt provide very little, if any, structural strength to the belt. The purpose of the top cover is to protect the carcass from impact damage and wear.The bottom cover provides a friction surface for driving and tracking the belt.
