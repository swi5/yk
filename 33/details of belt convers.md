## What are the Basics for Belt Conveyors Presentation - JMS
A belt conveyor receives product on an inlet or impact area. The material remains static on the belt as the belt itself moves and conveys the material to the discharge point, unlike screw conveyors where the material is mixing and turning while the screw conveys the material. This screw conveyor mixing action can lead to some material property
