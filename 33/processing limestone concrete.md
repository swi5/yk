## Limestone Aggregate Production - Melgaard Construction
Create a superior concrete - limestone bonds more tightly to the cement and is lighter-weight than gravel. Encourage proper drainage - limestone's permeability allows water to maintain its natural course while discouraging erosion. Have a low to non-existent silica content - this reduces the risk of an alkali-silica reaction.
