## iron ore beneficiation yield
What is the Beneficiation Process? Oct 01, 2014· It is often used in the preparation of iron ore for smelting. This is an essential process as it helps improve the yield from a deposit of ore, thereby increasing the potential profits that can be obtained from the ore and allowing mining companies to increase the overall profitability of a mine.

##  Beneficiation, sintering, and processing of raw materials for the iron 
BENEFICIATION OF IRON ORES BENEFICIATION of iron ores relates not only to enrichment of the metal content but also to improvements in phy-_ sical characteristics of the ore charged into the blast-furnace. The latter is achieved by crushing, sizing, and agglomeration of resultant fines, etc. It is universally recognized that preparation of sized

## Iron Ore Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.
