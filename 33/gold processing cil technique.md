## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

The CIL process concentrates gold from 2.5-3.5 g/t in ore to 2000 to 6000 g/t on carbon. Although the earliest process was in South Africa in 1890, CIP/CIL was first introduced in gold processing in 1949 at San Andreas (Honduras) (Marsden and House, 2006).
