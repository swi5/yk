Bauxite ore contains 30-60% aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3). In the Bayer process (Figure 2), the bauxite is digested in a pressure vessel along with a sodium hydroxide solution (caustic soda) at an elevated temperature, which dissolves the aluminum oxide converting it into sodium aluminate, leaving insoluble red mud solids as a by-product. The alumina is extracted from the bauxite by means of the

## minerals beneficiation plant separation
 Magnetic separation is a mineral separation method in heterogeneous magnetic field according to the difference of mineral magnetism in ore. Magnetic separation is mainly used for magnetic oxide minerals of ferrous minerals, such as magnetite, V-Ti magnetite, hematite and ilmenite, and also for pyrrhotite beneficiation.

Abstract The feasibility of using high intensity wet magnetic separation (HIMS) to beneficiate industrial minerals, coal, and metallic ore was investigated on a pilot plant scale. The experimental procedure consisted of preparing a water slurry of the raw material and pumping it through a magnetic field for a stipulated retention time.

## What Is Mineral Beneficiation? - Sepro Labs
What is mineral beneficiation? Mineral beneficiation is a process by which valuable constituents of an ore are concentrated by means of a physical separation process. As one of the initial steps of extractive metallurgy, the main purpose is to prepare the ore prior to downstream purification processes.

## Different types of separation methods for minerals
Mineral processing is the first step for ore once it leaves the mine. The process involves ore preparation, milling, and ore dressing, commonly known as beneficiation. Beneficiation mechanically separates the grains of ore minerals from the gangue (low value) minerals that surround them in order to produce a concentrate made up of useful minerals.
