Rippers can be used for limestone mining as limestone is a 'rippable' sedimentary rock (refer to Sect. 3.1.1) Using rippers in small mines or for a group consisting of more than one mine is economical and productive. Instantaneous blasting or blasting with delay detonators in mines are executed in circuits.
