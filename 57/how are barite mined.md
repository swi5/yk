## Virginia Energy - Geology and Mineral Resources - Barite
Mined barite is ground to a fine powder and mixed with mud to make a heavy slurry. The mud is then poured down the drill hole creating a plug around and above the drill bit. Because barite is soft, it does not damage the drill bit, but due to its high specific gravity, barite effectively counteracts upward pressure, confining the oil or gas and

Barite is the principal ore of barium. Barium has very high number of applications. It is known to have more than 2000 industrial uses. However, the majority of barite mined is not used to extract barium. It is valuable in its native form because of high density. It is mostly used by oil & gas industry as an ingredient of drilling mud.

Most barite is produced using open pit mining techniques, and the barite ore then typically undergoes simple beneficiation methods to separate the mineral from the ore. Methods such as washing, jigging and tabling, which involve separating it in water or shaking it, are used to isolate the dense material.
