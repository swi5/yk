## Environmental and socio-economic impacts of coal mining
Men in underground coal mining are exposed to coal dust in the mine workings. However, opencast mining causes significantly worsening air quality in the mining zone in terms of dust and gaseous pollutants. It creates air pollution. There are issues within the mine and in the neighbouring residential areas, resulting in poor air quality.

## The True Cost of Coal
All of the impacts of coal have an economic cost, from the jobs lost by fishermen downstream of a coal mine, to the health care costs of the people sickened by coal-fired power plant pollution, to the cost of cleaning up spills of toxic coal waste.

In this paper, we examine the impact of the coal boom in the 1970s and the subsequent coal bust in the 1980s on local labour markets in Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. We address two main questions in our analysis. How were non-mining sectors affected by the shocks to the mining sector?

In this paper we take advantage of an economic shock that induced a substantial exogenous shift in the demand for labour in certain local labour markets. We examine the impact of the coal boom in the 1970s and the subsequent coal bust in the 1980s on local economies in the four‐state region of Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.

## Negative Effects of Coal Mining
Chemical, Air & Dust Pollution: Underground mining allows coal companies to dig for coal deeper into the ground. The problem is that huge amounts of earth and rock are brought up from the bowels of the earth. These mining wastes can become toxic when they are exposed to air and water. Examples of toxins are mercury, arsenic, fluorine and selenium.

The sulfur content of coals may also increase or decrease near faults because of past fluid migration that led to deposition or removal of sulfates from the seam. Potential mining problems near tectonic faults. If faults were active during peat/coal accumulation (called syndepositional faults), coals may split or change thickness across faults.
