Those hard rock minerals can easily be determined with XRD. The related annual savings of a larger mine exceed the costs of an X-ray laboratory by far. (Source: Mining Magazine (March 2015) p 38-40). Properties relevant to extracting Copper from the rock solely depend on the type of minerals present in the specimen and not the chemistry.

## How Underground Mining Works | HowStuffWorks
The least common method in hard-rock mining, block caving, is typically saved for low-grade ore. It involves drilling a section of ore at the very bottom of the deposit and then blasting to make the roof collapse. Gravity then takes over, as the ore above the blast site fractures and collapses in succession as support is withdrawn.

Copper ore usually contains about 0.5 to 2% copper that occurs in the form of disseminated and stringers. The run of mine ore is reduced from 150 mm to 25 mm size in Jaw and Cone crushers. The crushed ore is grinded in ball mills to −74 μm size. The ore is processed by froth flotation comprising rougher and scavenger cells.

Many pyrite and pyrrhotite minerals contain gold, which is often recovered when extracting copper from lode vein deposits. The purity of gold is stated in terms of fineness and carats (ct). Fineness is defined as the parts per 1000. For example gold with a fineness of 800 means it is 80% pure gold. Alternatively, gold that is 100% pure is 24ct.

Investors who make use of the Top Thirty Shorted Stocks List that appears weekly on thebull.au have noticed the absence of three of the top miners on the ASX with lithium mining as their primary focus - Pilbara Minerals (PLS), Orocobre (ORE), and Galaxy Minerals (GXY). By the company's estimates, it could see lithium sales volumes adding up to around 100,000 metric tons in 2021.

Most hard-rock room and pillar mines are large (2,000 to 7,000 tpd) but there are some very small zinc mines in Illinois-Wisconsin that use room and pillar. One common consistency between these small and large deposits are regular dimensions. When thickness is constantly changing, it is difficult to use room and pillar.

## From digging to electric fields: new technique to extract metals from 
May 16, 2021An international group of scientists has developed a new mining technique that uses electric fields, instead of digging, to extract metals from hard rock ore. In a paper published in the journal

## is copper ore hard
The average grade of copper ores in the 21st century is below 0.6% copper, with a proportion of economic ore minerals (including copper) being less than 2% of the total volume of the ore rock. A key objective in the metallurgical treatment of any ore is the separation of ore .

## Copper Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Mark E. Schlesinger,  William G. Davenport, in Extractive Metallurgy of Copper (Fifth Edition), 2011 1.2.1 Concentration by Froth Flotation (Chapters 3 and 4 Chapter 3 Chapter 4). The copper ores being mined in 2010 are too lean in copper (0.5-2% Cu) to be smelted directly. Heating and melting their huge quantity of waste rock would require prohibitive amounts of hydrocarbon fuel.
