Luckily, both limestone and sandstone generally tend to absorb minimal amounts of water, meaning they are ideal for all outdoor spaces, especially if you reside in an area of the country prone to rain. One minor difference between the two stones is that lighter shades of sandstone are slightly more porous than darker colours.

Sandstone are both sedimentary rocks, there are profound differences between the two types of rocks. Being sedimentary rocks, they both began life at the surface of the earth and were buried and lithified (turned to stone), but there the similarity ends. Sandstone is a kind of rock made of, as you would expect, sand-sized particles of other rocks.
