For mining communities, it was simply a fact of working to survive. Women and children were banned from working underground after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act.  The mound-like remains of small pits operated by the Carron Company in the early 1800s can be seen to the north and north-west of the village of Banton.

India currently, about 2% of underground coal production comes from longwall mining, but it is planned to increase production by longwall to 40%. In the modern world day by day, mining plays prominent role for the extraction of minerals, which are necessary. So we go for open cast mining and underground mining.

Underground coal mining mainly include the process of drift, slope, and shaft mining, and actual mining methods include longwall and room and pillar mining. Drift Mines enter the side of a hill horizontally and mine the coal within the hill. Slope mines usually begin in a valley bottom, and a tunnel slopes down to the coal surface.

## Coal mining methods - Coal in India
There are two methods of underground mining for coal: bord and pillar and longwall mining. In bord and pillar mines, a grid of 'rooms' or 'bords' are cut into the coal seam, leaving behind 'pillars' to support the roof of the mine. The pillars left behind can represent up to 40 per cent of the coal contained in the seam. As such

Mar 29, 2022Coal demand in the country is yet to peak as the Economic Survey projects coal demand in the range of 1.3-1.5 billion tonnes by 2030, an increase of 63 percent from the current demand. Thus, as of now, there is no scenario of energy transition away from coal affecting any stakeholders involved in coal mining.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

2. Mining Methods • Coal is mined by two main methods - surface or 'opencast' mining and 'underground' mining. • The choice of method is largely determined by the depth, geology of the coal deposit and other factors. • The majority of the world's coal production is coming from Opencast mines. • This scenario is same in India also.

How Underground Mining Works. Underground mines are the alternative to surface mines. Surface mines excavate from the top down, a method that can become inefficient at depths greater than about 200 feet (60 meters) [sources: Illinois Coal Association, De Beers].Undergrounds coal mines can drive 2,500 feet (750 meters) into the Earth and other types even deeper -- uranium mines can reach 6,500

## Mining Methods - Indian Infrastructure
The demand for high quality coal can be met by adopting underground production methods such as cut-and-fill, bord-and-pillar, shrinkage stopping and longwall coal mining. These methods are supported by highly mechanised equipment. Key among these are continuous miners, longwall mining, load haul dumper and sub-level stoping. Continuous miners
