The curve of viscoelastic friction vs. velocity has a typical bell-like shape, with a local maximum in the intermediate velocity range. The location of the local maximum depends on the material relaxation time. This force, also known as indentation rolling resistance, is important in many applications, for example in belt conveyors.

## Fabric conveyor belt essentials | Guide for engineers
When installing a conveyor belt, it is important to use sufficient pre-tension. If the pre-tension is too low, you lose grip on the drive after the fabric has been relaxed and it may slip. For a conveyor belt with PET fabric, the pre-tension at installation is at least 0.3% (0.5% for PA fabric), which is usually sufficient for correct operation.

Aug 3, 2021by：YiFan Conveyor . Friction is a phenomenon in which two objects in contact with each other undergo relative movement (or have a relative movement tendency) under the action of external force, and tangential movement resistance is generated between the contact surfaces. Abrasion is the material on the working surface of an object.

Fire Resistant Anti Static (FRAS) conveyor belts are engineered so that the top and bottom covers of the conveyor belt meet local fire retardancy standards. This means these belts are difficult to ignite and should never be the cause of a fire. Additionally, if ignited by an external fire source, they should minimize the propagation of the fire.
