## 6 Granite Crushers to Maximize Granite Crushing Efficiency
Taking the granite sand production line as an example, the crushing process is as follows: 1. Coarse (primary) crushing: Bulky granite stones are evenly fed into the jaw crusher by the vibrating feeder. 2. Secondary crushing: The coarsely crushed granite stone is sent to the cone crusher by the belt conveyor. 3.

## Compressive strength
The compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test, there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence, for this region, =, where, this time, E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region, the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.
