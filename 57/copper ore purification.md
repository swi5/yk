## TENORM: Copper Mining and Production Wastes | US EPA
Ores that contain copper in the U.S. are typically mined in large, open-pits. Copper processing facilities are usually located near mining or extraction sites. Significant waste volumes are associated with copper production. Mine wastes may contain radionuclides due to their natural presence in ores and can be a source of TENORM.

## Common Silver Extraction Methods - Mining-pedia
Due to the complex mineral composition of lead-zinc-copper associated silver ore, the symbiotic relationship, embedded properties and oxidation degree of the ores are different, and the extraction effect is also very different. At present, flotation is a common method for extracting lead-zinc-copper associated silver ore.

## Copper Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The principal copper ore mineral is chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), which is commonly smelted to yield a matte containing ∼50% copper.In the presence of silica flux, iron is selectively oxidized to a slag. Figure 14 shows a PSD for the Cu-Fe-S-O system at 1 atm SO 2 as a function of temperature (Rosenqvist 1978).Unlike the system for lead, the copper and Cu 2 S melts are nearly immiscible

Copper sulfide ores are typically processed using pyrometallurgy, the extraction and purification of the metal through a process that involves heating. The process uses a series of physical steps and high temperatures to extract and purify copper from copper sulfide ore, divided into four basic steps: 1. froth flotation, 2. concentration, 3. smelting and 4. electrolysis.

Mining produces ores with less than 1 percent copper. Concentration is accomplished at the mine sites by crushing, grinding, and flotation purification, resulting in ore with 15 to 35 percent copper. A continuous process called floatation, which uses water, various flotation chemicals, and compressed air, separates the ore into fractions.

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
The techniques for extraction of copper from oxidized ores are quite different from those employed for the sulfide ores. The oxidized ores, consisting of the silicates, carbonates and sulfates, are treated by several methods, all involving some form of leaching of the crushed ore with sulfuric acid to produce impure solutions of copper sulfate.

Most copper is mined in the form of the ores chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), chalcocite (CU2S), and malachite (Cu2C03(0H)2). The sulfides are most abundant and yield copper metal when heated strongly in the presence of oxygen. In Section 17.6 we discussed applications of electrolysis in the extraction and purification of metals from their ore sources.
