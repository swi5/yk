On June 3, 2019, SRP announced that it would be shutting down the coal-fired Hayden plant in 2027, as well as Craig Unit 1 in 2025, Unit 2 in 2028, Four Corners Power Plant in 2031, and Coronado no later than 2032. Furthermore, SRP's current plan will reduce carbon by 65% from 2005 levels in 2035 and 90% by 2050.

## How coal generates electricity?s
Does electricity come from coal? Coal was the third-largest energy source for U.S. electricity generation in 2020—about 19%. Nearly all coal-fired power plants use steam turbines. A few coal-fired power plants convert coal to a gas for use in a gas turbine to generate electricity.

Of the 140 coal-fired power plants in operation, more than two-thirds (representing ~50% of installed coal capacity) will be retired. Around 5 GW of new ultra-supercritical and integrated gasification combined-cycle plants will replace some of the retired capacity. In Germany, ~EUR 4.35 billion will be awarded to lignite power plant companies

In the thermal power plant, the electrical energy is transformed from heat energy. Heat energy can be derived from different heat sources like; coal, diesel, biofuel, solar energy, nuclear energy, etc. The power plant that uses coal to generate heat is known as the thermal power plant. The thermal power plant is a conventional power plant.

In the case of natural gas, it is driven by pipeline capacity and the priority of capacity reserved for domestic home heating. For Thermal Power plants, the production cost of electricity is about 80-85% of the fuel cost for clean coal plants. The fuel cost component for highly efficient natural gas combined cycle turbines is about 90-95% fuel

This is a list of operational coal-fired power stations in the United States. In 2019 there were 241 coal powered units across the United States[1] which generated 23% of the United States electricity in 2019,[2] an amount of electricity similar to that from renewable energy or nuclear power[3][4] but about half of the amount generated by natural gas plants.

## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity. Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, [1] but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.
