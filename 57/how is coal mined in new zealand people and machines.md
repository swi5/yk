## Miner/Quarry Worker - Careers New Zealand
Opportunities for miners in New Zealand have declined since 2014 and around 600 jobs have been lost in the coal mining industry. This is due to: poor prices for coal, oil and gold worldwide; limits on land for mining; closure of a major coal mining company. However, opportunities for miners are still average and likely to increase due to:

## History of coal mining
Early coal extraction was small-scale, the coal lying either on the surface, or very close to it. Typical methods for extraction included drift mining and bell pits.As well as drift mines, small scale shaft mining was used. This took the form of a bell pit, the extraction working outward from a central shaft, or a technique called room and pillar in which 'rooms' of coal were extracted with

Coal produces less than 10% of New Zealand's primary energy. The largest user is Bluescope NZ Steel at Glenbrook. The second is Fonterra. In a dry year when hydro power is down the Huntly power station (owned by Genesis) can be second biggest, but it is being phased out. Coal is a twilight industry employing fewer New Zealanders every year.

State-owned Solid energy is the biggest coal mining company, and about 80% of the coal reserves can be found in Southland. Gold was first discovered in the country in 1852, and this led to a gold rush in the 1860s. The amount of gold mined in New Zealand accounts for slightly under 1% of the global gold production.
