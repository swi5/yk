## A Gentle Introduction to Function Optimization - Machine Learning Mastery
An objective function may have a single best solution, referred to as the global optimum of the objective function. Alternatively, the objective function may have many global optima, in which case we may be interested in locating one or all of them. Many numerical optimization methods seek local minima. Local minima are locally optimal, but we
