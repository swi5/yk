Solutions to the Phenomenon after the Construction of Refractory Castables and Preforms. (1) Dry the castable as soon as possible after construction to remove water and eliminate the carrier of sodium salt in the cast, so that the alkali stays in the construction body and no longer migrates to the surface. (2) If the construction conditions

A refractory material or refractory is a material that is resistant to decomposition by heat, pressure, or chemical attack, and retains strength and form at high temperatures. Refractories are polycrystalline, polyphase, inorganic, non-metallic, porous, and heterogeneous.They are typically composed of oxides or carbides, nitrides etc. of the following materials: silicon, aluminium, magnesium

1) the surface is smooth and free from pits, cracks and seams; 2) The lining should be compact, and it should be inspected with a 0.5kg hammer every 200 mm. The sound should be loud and clear, and no serious "hoarse" or empty drum sound is allowed. Otherwise, chisel off the heavy lining. Fourth, defect repair.

## Refractory Corrosion and Glass Defects _Zhengzhou Sunrise Refractory
The refractory materials used in glass furnaces are exposed to high temperature and mechanical corrosion during the operation, which results in corrosion of refractories and glass defects. Silica brick is a kind of acid refractory mainly made from tridymite, cristobalite and a small amount of residual quartz as well as glass phase.

While stone can succumb to many different problems, here are the five that our Glasgow roofers most commonly encounter. 1. Salt Crystallisation. Salt crystallisation is a problem that most people will be familiar with and shows itself as a white powder on the surface of stone. Salts in solutions such as acid rain enter the pores of the stonework.
