## Localisation of Iron and Steel Industries in the World
Both iron ore-based and coal-based sites are common for iron and steel industry. Iron ore based location is not a very rare phenomenon. They occur in Lorraine in France, Duluth in USA, Bhadravati, Vishakhapatnam in India, Corby in UK. Coal-based plant, in fact, at one time was the most sought after locations.

## Coal use in iron and steel metallurgy - ScienceDirect
More attention is paid to ironmaking as the most energy consuming segment of the process chain. For example, blast furnace ironmaking including sintering and coking plants consumes about 65-75% of the entire energy at an integrated steelworks (ca. 11-12 GJ/t hot metal) (Babich, 2009).Both direct and indirect coal use, e.g. in the form of coke, is presented.

## Mining the Iron Mountain - Coal Age
The Iron Mountain mine in southwestern Utah has served as a source of iron ore for many uses during its 160-year history. From the mid-19th century to the early years of the 21st century, its magnetite/hematite ores were first used to forge pioneer-era hinges and hardware, later for wartime steelmaking and then for producing plate, pipe and structural components to support post-World War II

Lumber and Grain, Coal and Ore. Beginning in the 1840s, the Great Lakes became busy highways for moving wheat, corn, lumber, coal, and iron ore. Crops from midwestern farms crossed the lakes to markets in the East. Lumber from the region's vast pine forests made Chicago the world's busiest lumber port in the 1870s.

Air which is heated to about 1200°C is blown into the furnace through nozzles in the lower section. The air causes the coke to burn, producing carbon monoxide which reacts with the iron ore, as well as heat to melt the iron. Finally, the tap hole at the bottom of the furnace is opened and molten iron and slag (impurities) are drained off.

Today, it is estimated that the global steel industry used about 2 billion tonnes of iron ore, 1 billion tonnes of metallurgical coal and 575 million tonnes of steel scrap to produce about 1.7 billion tonnes of crude steel. Recycled steel (also called scrap steel) is one of the industry's most important raw materials.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.
