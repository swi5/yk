## The case for wet processing iron ore - HAVER Australia
For a high-grade iron ore deposit, that is, greater than 62 per cent, a dry crushing and sizing process is sufficient to achieve the required product quality and size fraction as lump ore, sponge ore or sinter fines. Other deposits with lower ore quality, less than 58 per cent, could use selective mining and blending methods to achieve

## The Step-by-Step Process of Producing Iron from Iron Ore
The raw materials mix or "charge" enters the furnace from the top and hot air is blown or blasted from the bottom causing the coke to burn and the oxygen to combine with carbon in the coke to form carbon monoxide. Now, this carbon monoxide that is unstable, reacts with the ore to form carbon dioxide and iron. The Separation Of Iron-.

As-mined iron ore contains lumps of varying size, the biggest being more than 1 metre (40 inches) across and the smallest about 1 millimetre (0.04 inch).  If the lump ore is of the appropriate quality, it can be charged to the blast furnace without any further processing. Fines, however, must first be agglomerated,

What is Pyrite. Commonly called fool's gold, pyrite is the Earth's most abundant sulfide mineral. Recognized for its brass-yellow color which resembles that of gold, pyrite is a source of iron and sulfur and is used for the production of sulfuric acid. Some types of pyrite contain enough microscopic gold to warrant mining them as a gold ore.

The iron ore that is blasted is stacked and loaded upon large dumpers to be moved to the blast furnaces for smelting process. Benches are made for the process of iron ore mining. Mechanized mining involves creation of benches that are used for the purpose of drilling, blasting, and finally the transportation of the iron ore to the crushing plant.
