## Commercial Cocoa Beans Roasting Time and Temperature in Factory
The roasting time lasts 30 minutes to 2 hours, and the temperature is above 250 degrees Fahrenheit. The roasting time and temperature depend on the difference between the cocoa bean varieties and the desired final results. The cocoa beans turned over and over again, dried, turned dark brown, and the distinctive aroma of chocolate became apparent.

## Quality Control in Cocoa Bean Processing using Color Measurement
If quality control points out a problem in fermentation right away, it can be fixed immediately before ruining more raw cocoa beans. Ruined beans can be thrown out instead of being completely processed, saving time and money. Drying. The next stage in the process is drying, which reduces acidity levels in the cocoa beans 2.
