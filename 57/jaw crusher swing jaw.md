## Jaw Crusher
A jaw crusher is generally used as a primary crusher in a crushing circuit. Product is fed into the top of the jaw crusher by an vibrating grizzly feeder. The eccentric rotating drive shaft causes the movable jaw to oscillate crushing the aggregate against a fixed jaw. Jaw crushers are run on belt drives driven by an electric motor or diesel

The Unique Elliptical motion of the swing jaw guarantees a highly efficient production rate at every setting. This special motion of the jaw also minimizes scrubbing action common in single toggle jaw crushers. The design also permits an extra long jaw length which in turn means more crushing strokes giving a high ratio of reduction.

## Crusher
A jaw or toggle crusher consists of a set of vertical jaws, one jaw is kept stationary and is called a fixed jaw while the other jaw called a swing jaw, moves back and forth relative to it, by a cam or pitman mechanism, acting like a class II lever or a nutcracker. The volume or cavity between the two jaws is called the crushing chamber.
