## Strategies to reduce water consumption in concentrator plants (part 1)
The water loss in the concentrator (the moisture in the product) accounts for only 0.5%. In iron ore concentrator plants, which have higher product mass yield than copper plants, the water consumption increases to 15% at the concentrator and decreases to 85% at the tailings dam. In both plants the water consumption in the tailings dam is high.

## Gold Processing with Saline Water - OneMine
The reduced oxygen solubility in saline water can seriously reduce the rate of gold leaching, while dissolved oxygen meters do not necessarily reveal actual oxygen concentrations in saline water. High levels of magnesium in the ground water necessitate operation at lower pH (-9), with the potential for greater cyanide loss via HCN stripping.

Make sure the plants/nuts/berries you use as dye are mature, ripe or in full bloom. To make your dye, you typically need 2 parts water to one part plant, etc. Chop your plant material into small pieces and boil for an hour or two, strain, and then dunk whatever fabric you are dyeing {make sure the fabric is wet}. Dye your fabric. Add the bleach

## Gold Leaching Agent Compared to Cyanide in Gold Processing
Cyanide leaching is a process in which solid natural gold in ore or beneficiation product forms a gold-cyanide complex dissolved in water under the combined action of a leaching agent, an oxidizing agent and a base, that is, a phase transformation process of solid phase gold. Chemical reaction formula for gold leaching: 4Au+8KCN+2H2O→4KAu (CN
