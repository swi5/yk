## Activated Carbon in Gold Cyanidation - FEECO International Inc.
The gold cyanidation process is a primary method of gold beneficiation. Activated carbon is a critical component in the beneficiation of gold ore, allowing this widespread process to occur because of its ability to recover gold from the gold-cyanide complex. Depending on the deposit, some silver ores may also be processed via cyanidation.

Refractory Gold. The last type of gold deposit is called refractory gold, and it is the most difficult type to extract. It can be defined as any ore that responds poorly to a conventional gravity-cyanidation process with examples including copper porphyry, complex sulfides, arsenopyrite and lead-zinc associations.

Cyanide leaching has been the industry standard for gold processing for more than 100 years. During the cyanide leach process, a cyanide solution, or lixiviant, is percolated through ore contained in vats, columns or heaps. Gold is dissolved by the cyanide and then removed from the heap or columns.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

## Everything about Gold Processing, Smelting, Refining, Cyanidation
Dec 4, 2020The Cyanidation process contributes to the recovery of more gold. The process is about oxidation and dissolving of metallic gold in an alkaline cyanide solution. Atmospheric oxygen acts as the oxidant in the process. The oxidant helps to dissolve the gold and forms sodium hydroxide as well as sodium cyanoaurite.

## Summary of Gold Cyanidation
1.Gold Cyanidation Principle. Gold Cyanidation is a method in which gold is extracted from gold-bearing ores using aqueous solution of cyanide as solvent, and then gold is extracted from gold-bearing leaching solution. It includes cyanide leaching process and deposition gold extraction process. First, gold in the gold-bearing ore reacts with cyanide to form a complex into the solution, and
