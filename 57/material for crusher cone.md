## What is a Cone Crusher?
Cone crushers are a type of compression crusher used by aggregate, coal, concrete, crushing, fracking sand, and mining industries, which reduces material by squeezing or compressing it until it breaks. Specifically, the material is compressed between an eccentrically rotating piece of steel, the mantle, and a stationary piece of steel, the bowl.
