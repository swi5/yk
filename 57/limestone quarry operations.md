The quarrying operation produces a large amount of solid waste at a rate of 88.18-132 tons/day ( Hayyat, 2008 ). Solid waste from limestone quarrying has a variety of uses, ranging from the manufacturing of masonry blocks to cement production ( Felekoglu, 2007; Turgut, 2008 ).

## Limestone extraction - underground mining techniques, drilling 
Limestone is a sedimentary rock comprising about 15% of the earth's sedimentary crust. Limestones are generally mined in the method of open pit mining and underground mining based on the economic and environmental conditions. Surface limestone mining. All over the world, the limestones are generally mined from a quarry or the open pit mining.

## Limestone quarry, quarrying, cement raw materials
Since a form of calcium carbonate, usually limestone, is the predominant raw material, most plants are situated near a limestone quarry or receive this material from a source via inexpensive transportation. Cement manufacturing begins with quarrying operations in which limestone in mines is quarried and brought to crusher for crushing.

Quarries for mining limestone, dolomite, sandstone, and hard rock (granite and quartzite) are found in 34 counties. A 1990 DNR Minerals inventory found 165 active operations, 88% of which were limestone quarries (Nelson and others, 1990). That same inventory counted 1,367 inactive operations, 70% of which were limestone quarries.

## Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company
The Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company (a.k.a. Michigan Limestone) operates the world's largest limestone quarry, which is located near Rogers City, Michigan.It was formed and organized in 1910; however, production did not begin until 1912. Ownership of the quarry has changed a number of times, but it is still one of the country's largest producers of limestone.
