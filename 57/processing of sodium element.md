## Na Sodium Element Information: Facts, Properties, Trends, Uses and 
The element . Sodium was discovered by H. Davy in year 1807 in United Kingdom.. Sodium was first isolated by H. Davy in 1807.Sodium derived its name from the English word soda (natrium in Latin).Andreas Sigismund Marggraf recognised the difference between soda ash and potash in 1758. Davy discovered sodium a few days after potassium, by using electrolysis onsodium hydroxide.
