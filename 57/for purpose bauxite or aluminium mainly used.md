## What are the uses of bauxite in Jamaica?
Aluminium is used in a number of things that we come across and use on a daily basis, such as foil wrap, soda cans, motor vehicles, aeroplanes, buildings, just to name a few. Generally, after mining, the rare bauxite goes through a refining process which it converts it to alumina (the main component in aluminium production).

## Bauxite Beneficiation: Efficient Way to Remove Silica in Bauxite
The main component of bauxite is Al 2 O 3, containing a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, and other impurities. The main objective of bauxite beneficiation is to lower the concentration of reactive silica, and also to increase the alumina content. In addition, bauxite beneficiation can also be used for iron extraction or iron removal.

Gem industry: Aluminium oxide is used in the process of formation of sapphires and rubies. In its crystalline form, or corundum, alumina is the base element for the creation of these two precious gems. Industrial application: Because aluminium oxide is chemically inert, it is the perfect filler for bricks, plastics, and heavy clayware.
