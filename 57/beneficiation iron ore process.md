## EmergingTech_BeneficiationprocessforOreExtraction - Vedanta Spark
When the ore is extracted from the mines it is not excavated in the purest form which can be processed. There will be resulting gangue minerals (Mn at 3%) along with the ore concentrate which needs to be refined. This process generates two by-products, which include high grade ore and waste streams. The beneficiation can be done either
