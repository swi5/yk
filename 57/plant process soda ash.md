Soda ash production emits greenhouse gases, such as CO 2 and SO x. With 60MT of soda ash produced per year, the industry emits 58MT of CO 2. Thus, stringent regulations in western markets such as North America and Europe restrict the use of synthetic soda ash, which is expected to limit market growth during the forecast period.

Soda has been used in production for over 5000 years. Until the 19th century, soda was made from the ashes of plants grown in sodium-rich soil. This method was so popular so that the powder was named "Soda Ash". Soda mined from today's Trona deposit is one of the world's most plentiful natural resources.

## What is Soda Ash? - Industrial Minerals Association - IMA-NA
May 5, 2022The industry-familiar term "mono-process" originates from this process step. The crystals are dewatered and washed using cyclones and centrifuges, and the solution is recycled to the evaporator units for further recovery of soda ash. The monohydrate crystals are fed to rotary kilns where they are dried to finished soda ash.

The preparation of soda ash is generally done using one of four processes - the Leblanc process, the Dual-process, the Solvay process, and the Electrolytic process. Soda ash is a weak acid that is slightly soluble in ethanol and insoluble in alcohol. One of the important applications of this compound is as a water softener.

## Project Report - Profile on soda ash plant from solvay process, Bank 
SODA ASH PLANT FROM SOLVAY PROCESS [CODE NO. 1635] Soda ash is chemically known as sodium carbonate. Broadly there are two ways in which soda ash is produced; it is either manufactured synthetically from salt or is obtained from refining of naturally available mineral, trona, or naturally occurring sodium carbonate-bearing brines.
