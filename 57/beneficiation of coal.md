##  Chemical Beneficiation of Low Grade Coal - a Review
Keywords: Coal; Chemical beneficiation; Physical beneficiation; ash. 1. INTRODUCTION Coals which are low in specific energy because of high moisture content and / or high ash/ sulfur contents, and produce emissions of concern are termed as low grade coal. Coal generally incorporates various amounts of mineral matter as impurity.

Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both. Way Forward. The arrival of private players in the coal mining practices can bring a lot of better things into the picture.

## COKING COAL BENEFICIATION | SciTech Connect - Elsevier
The first step of Beneficiation is to crush or grind the coal to liberate the coaly matter from ashy matter which can theoretically yield complete liberation. In the case of intergrown texture, finer grinding up to a few micron size is necessary for complete liberation whereas for free dirt ordinary crushing is sufficient (Kumar, D., 1982).

##  Coal Beneficiation Technology - 2007 Initiatives, Policies and Practices
Coal Beneficiation Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both. Two basic processes of beneficiation: - Dry-deshaling: Non-coal or shaly-coal is removed without using any liquid media.

Problems and Solutions. Pennsylvania coal has been mined since the 1800's.Before 1977 under-regulated mining left open pits, coal refuse, spoil piles, acid mine drainage, open shafts, erosion, clogged streams, undermined areas with subsidence potential, underground fires and damaged buildings throughout the nation. States began promulgating reclamation laws as early as the 1930's.

## Coal Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The hard coal beneficiation process in mechanical preparation plants generates coarse, small or fines rejects and coal tailings slurries. The tailings are the finest grain size, with the majority below ~ 0.25 mm, whereby material sized below 0.035 mm makes up to 60% share in the slurry composition.

## Beneficiation of canary shell as a mixture of coal briquette
Research methods of this study were coal and canary shell carbonation grinded being the size 28 mesh, 65 mesh and 80 mesh, then conducted briquetting process with the starch and water as glue with the composition 125 gr: 25 gr: 50 ml and every size consist of four kinds of briquettes that are 100% canary shell, 100% coal, 50% canary: 50% coal
