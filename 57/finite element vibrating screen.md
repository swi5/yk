## Failure and sensitivity analysis of a reconfigurable vibrating screen 
In this paper a finite element analysis (FEA) on a reconfigurable vibrating screen (RVS) is carried out to determine whether the structure will perform as desired under extreme working conditions at the different configurations of 305 mm × 610 mm, 305 mm × 1220 mm and 610 mm × 1220 mm. This process is aimed at eliminating unplanned shutdowns

ANSYS Workbench is a project-management tool. It can be considered as the top-level interface linking all our software tools. Workbench handles the passing of data between ANSYS Geometry / Mesh / Solver / Postprocessing tools. This greatly helps project management. You do not need worry about the individual files on disk (geometry, mesh etc).

When using the finite element method (FEM) to solve mechanics problems governed by a set of partial differential equations, the problem domain is first discretized (in a proper manner) into a set of small elements . In each of these elements, the variation/profile/pattern of the displacements is assumed in simple forms to obtain element equations.
