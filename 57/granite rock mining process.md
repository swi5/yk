## Quarrying of Stones: Its Methods, Selection of Site  - CivilSeek
The process of extraction of suitable stones from their natural rock beds or layers is commonly called Quarrying of Stones. It differs from the mining of ores of metals in that whereas quarrying is an operation carried out entirely on the surface, mining involves digging below the ground, sometimes at considerable depth.

## From Quarry to Countertop: How Marble and Granite Are Mined
Aug 3, 2021Mining marble from a quarry involves creating a bench wall, which requires synthetic diamond wire and diamond-tipped drills to separate the rock to form a vertical plane. This involves drilling holes in the marble from the top of the quarry and lining up another drill hole from the side.

Granite quarrying. Granite is a type of rock formed deep below the earth´s surface from slowly cooling magma. Large machinery is brought in to extract (or quarry) the granite from open-pit mines using wire saws or diamond wire saws. Quality control already starts here.

Granite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ n ə t /) is a coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase.It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous intrusions.These range in size from dikes only a few centimeters

## Mechanical behavior of the weak bedding plane within sandstone 
The wave sources such as explosion, impact, seismic and earthquake events in underground excavation, mining and rock slope engineering may cause the rock mass to suffer dynamic tensile stress, resulting in the tensile failure which usually occurs firstly on the rock discontinuities. However, there are few studies and little understanding on dynamic tensile behavior of rock discontinuities due

## Granite | Properties, Formation, Composition, Uses - Geology Science
The this rock mining is a capital and labor intensive process. The granite pieces are removed from the deposits by cutting or spraying operations. Special slicers are used to cut granite-extracted pieces into portable plates, which are then packed and transported by rail or shipping services. China, Brazil and India are the leading granite
