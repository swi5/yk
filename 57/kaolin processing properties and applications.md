Kaolin dry beneficiation process. The kaolinite dry mining process is a simple and economical process. The ore is crushed to 25.4mm by a hammer crusher and fed into the cage mill to reduce the particle size to 6.35mm. The hot air in the cage mill reduces the moisture of the kaolin from about 20% to 10%. The crushed ore is further ground by a
