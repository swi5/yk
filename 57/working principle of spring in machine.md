History. The ancient Greek understanding of physics was limited to the statics of simple machines (the balance of forces), and did not include dynamics or the concept of work. During the Renaissance the dynamics of the Mechanical Powers, as the simple machines were called, began to be studied from the standpoint of how far they could lift a load, in addition to the force they could apply

Jul 31, 2022Spring balance is a force measuring device which works on the principle of Hooke's law. According to Hook's law, the force acting on the spring (along the axis of the spring) is directly proportional to the displacement of the spring, in the direction of the force. Construction of Spring Balance. Spring balance is made up of a coiled spring.

## How do springs work? | How do springs store energy? - Explain that Stuff
Apr 17, 2022It takes energy to deform a spring (change its shape): that energy is stored in the spring and you can use it again later. Springs are great for storing or absorbing energy. When you use a pushing or pulling force to stretch a spring, you're using a force over a distance so, in physics terms, you're doing work and using energy.
