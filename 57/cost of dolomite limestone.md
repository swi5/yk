## Dolomite Countertop Pros and Cons - Countertop Advisor
May 6, 2021Dolomite is a harder-than-average material and is not as fragile as marble. On the Mohs hardness scale, dolomite rates at 3.5 - 4, superior to marble's Mohs rating. A higher hardness rating makes it a durable and strong countertop over time, capable of supporting various uses while being resistant to wear and tear.
