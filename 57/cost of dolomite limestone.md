## Dolomite Countertop Pros and Cons - Countertop Advisor
May 6, 2021Dolomite is a harder-than-average material and is not as fragile as marble. On the Mohs hardness scale, dolomite rates at 3.5 - 4, superior to marble's Mohs rating. A higher hardness rating makes it a durable and strong countertop over time, capable of supporting various uses while being resistant to wear and tear.

Dolomite (also known as dolomite rock, dolostone or dolomitic rock) is a sedimentary carbonate rock that contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2.It occurs widely, often in association with limestone and evaporites, though it is less abundant than limestone and rare in Cenozoic rock beds (beds less than about 66 million years in age).
