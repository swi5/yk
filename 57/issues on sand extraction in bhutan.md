## Disappearing Beaches: What can be done about global sand shortages 
Sand extraction, mining, and dredging have all been linked with negative environmental impacts. For example, in Kenya, sand extraction has been linked with damaging coral reefs. In India, sand extraction has threatened critically endangered crocodiles. In Indonesia, islands have disappeared from too much sand mining.

Many places around the world bear the scars of rampant sand extraction. In southern India, for example, extensive sand mining along the Palar River fed a construction boom in the city of Chennai. In the images below, the dry, sandy river bed appears to have been scraped and excavated over the years, leaving a large depression now filled with water.

Today, demand for sand and gravel continues to increase. Mining operators, in conjunction with cognizant resource agencies, must work to ensure that sand mining is conducted in a responsible manner. Excessive instream sand-and-gravel mining causes the degradation of rivers. Instream mining lowers the stream bottom, which may lead to bank erosion.
