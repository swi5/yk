Looking at the change in the power sector from 2010 to 2020, there is a reduction in power generation by thermal coal plants. Reports indicate a 30% reduction in power generation from coal fired thermal plants [7, 16, 18]. This is aligned with the reduction of CO 2 released into the atmosphere from coal and gas plants [5, 12].

## How a Coal Plant Works
How a Coal Plant Works. Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced, under tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled, condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.

The crushed coal then continues up the conveyor into the plant and stored in a bunker. From the bunker, the coal passes through a pulverizer, which grinds it until it is a fine powder. This makes the coal highly flammable, so it ignites and burns immediately when blown into the furnace. A coal grinder for Unit 1 at Nebraska City Station.

This is how it works: Firstly the coal is dig from the mines and is supplied to the location where the coal-fired power plant is set up. This supply is made through a highway truck, railways or a barge.

## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity. Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, [1] but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.
