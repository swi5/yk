## Silica - Minerals Education Coalition
Description. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.

Silicon and oxygen are the two most abundant elements in Earth's crust, in which they largely occur in combination with other elements as silicate minerals. Free silica (SiO2) appears as a mineral in crystallizing magma only when the relative abundance of SiO2 exceeds that of all other cations available to form silicates. Silica minerals thus occur only in magmas containing more than about

The silica is the amorphous form Phoenix referred to back in 2012. The FR solution is classified as an inherent version as the silica is added in the fiber manufacturing process so the material becomes a form similar to the cellulose-polysilicic acid hybrid fiber that Phoenix identified. The "FR Sock" that intellibed describes is the most.
