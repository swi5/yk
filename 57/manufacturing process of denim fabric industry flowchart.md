Denim is a rugged cotton twill textile, in which the weft passes under two or more warp fibers, producing the familiar diagonal ribbing identifiable on the reverse of the fabric. In denim, garment washing is done to produce effects like color fading with or without patchiness, crinkles, seam puckering, hairiness, de-pilling, softened-hand feel, stabilized dimensions, etc. Denim washing is the

Transfer Printing Process: By a simple heat process, a design printed on a piece of paper is transferred to the fabric. The dyes used are capable of vaporizing under the heat conditions of the process, and therefore they have a high affinity for the fibers of the fabric. Transfer printing has long been used on polyester and polyamide.
