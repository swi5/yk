##  Coal Beneficiation — Application of froth flotation
adoption of flotation circuits. Beginning in early 50's when the upper horizon with low ash and low near gravity materials were mined, all either jigging or heavy media baths for beneficiation was found effective. The fines were taken out before the feed into the cleaning circuit. The fines were of low ash and were invariably re-mixed.

## Discrimination of Six Flotation Kinetic Models Used in the Conventional 
Compared to conventional flotation, the froth concentrate achieved by carrier flotation had a lower ash content and a greater yield at a fixed flotation time. The ash content of 51 # coal was reduced from 50.51 to 15.00% at a yield of 34.93% using carrier flotation, while the least ash content of the concentrate obtained from conventional
