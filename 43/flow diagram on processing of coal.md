The coal received at the power station is stored in dead storage in the form of piles laid directly on the ground. The coal stored has the tendency to whether (to combine with oxygen of air) and during this process coal loss some of its heating value and ignition quality. Due to low oxidation the coal may ignite spontaneously.
