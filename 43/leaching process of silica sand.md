## Production of High-Purity Silica Sand from Ivorian Sedimentary Basin by 
To produce high-purity silica sand usable for glass making, the present study was carried out. The objective of this work was to increase the silicon dioxide (SiO_2) content to at least 99% using a simple process without chemical input. The raw sand samples were taken from the Ivorian sedimentary basin, from Mafere and Assinie areas, Cote d'lvoire.

## Silica Sand Etching Behavior During a Primary Step of its Leaching Process
Thus, we have studied etching effect on particle granulometric size during a primary step of leaching process on Algerian silica sand with HF at 20% during 2, 4 and 6 hours. Therefore, a new granulometric classification of the sand is noted. Particles with proportional high size are the latest influenced and the mass loss is increased with time of leaching.

## Methods of cleaning and removing impurities from silica sand
The silica sand produced by this process has high hardness, high strength, few semi-broken particles, and low dust content. It is mainly used as a silica sand filter material for water treatment. The silica sand product produced by the wet process is water. The above is the method of cleaning and removing impurities of silica sand.
