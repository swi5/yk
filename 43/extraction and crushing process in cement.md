## Cement Manufacturing Process - Civil Engineering
Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

 Thus, it is important to know that no single process can be used for extraction of all the metals. The process to be used may differ from metal to metal. However, some steps are common that are involved in the extraction of metals. They are: a)Crushing and Pulverization of the ore. b)Dressing or concentration of the ore.

Extraction and processing. Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones, slates, and some shales, with the aid of blasting when necessary. Some deposits are mined by underground methods. Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.. The excavated materials are transported to the crushing
