## Willing-cool is the best manufacturer of micro
Dryer After the air is compressed, air dryers remove the extra moisture. It is important to install a dryer because water in wood causes rotting, water in metal causes rust, and water in walls creates mold. All of these negative effects are harmful to a business' profit and require maintenance.

## Sludge Drying by Belt, Disk, and Rotary Kiln Dryers
Wet raw sludge is usually fed into rotary kiln dryer by a screw feeder and dispersed into the dryer to have a large surface area. Depending on the feed sludge moisture content and the outlet sludge dry matter content, rotation speed of the dryer can be adjusted. In rotary kiln dryers, due to the high temperature drying, there will be dust

## Sludge treatment − convective sludge dryers | Sludge Processing
Flash dryers operate at a very short residence time. The sludge is dried using a rising hot air stream, flowing at 20-30 m/s, to both suspend and dry the particles. The dried product is separated using cyclones and/or bag filters. The dried sludge and exhaust gas temperatures are normally around 70 °C (160 °F) and °C respectively.

The material is fed in the rotary drum dryer by the conveyor, and when it's coming through the cylinder, the hot air will flow from it and makes it dried,. The dried material will be collected at the output. In this drying process, the material will move as the cylinder rotation. With the gravity, the material will fall from high-end to low-end.
