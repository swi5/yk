## Quarry Blasting Information | Village of Brookfield
There are two rock quarries that actively use blasting techniques to loosen the gravel which is then transported offsite: Vulcan Materials, which is the furthest south quarry and therefore unlikely to impact Brookfield, and Hanson Materials, this quarry is located just south of 47 th Street. Neither quarry is in Brookfield.

Currently, the quarry has over 100 trucks delivering rock to site on a daily basis. Although the journey to site is only 50km, it is arduous, utilizing a road system hardly designed or adequate for such deliveries. One-way trips can take up to 2h to negotiate and the quarry always has a few trucks in reserve to cope with the expected breakdowns.

## Blasting mechanics: Blasting design standards : Pit & Quarry
In practice, the stiffness ratio of a blast is typically between 1.5 and 4, with the highest frequency of around 2.6. At a stiffness ratio of 1 a blast will crater, meaning the blast will display violent blowout with rock ejected vertically. The blast will break under the borehole effect at a stiffness ratio of 4.

## Blasting Methods in Mining and Quarrying - GRT review
Apr 1, 2021Bench blasting is a common technique used in open-pit mines. It is blasting in a vertical or sub-vertical hole or a row of holes towards a free vertical surface. More than one row of holes can be blasted in the same round. A time delay in the detonation between the rows creates new free surfaces for each row. There are three methods in the process.

In such a case when it is located far away, the cost of transport of stone from the quarry to constructional sites may become too heavy. At the same time, a quarry must not be located very close to a town because quarrying operations are full of hazards. This becomes especially important when blasting method has to be used for quarrying of stones.

Quarry locations are determined by the location of geologic deposits. This can result in quarry sites that are established close to human habitation, or development may occur after establishment of the quarry site. Blasting, cutting, and truck traffic contribute to noise, vibration, and dust that may impact local residents.
