A big part of the answer is that the Study was done soon after multiple years of elevated phosphate rock prices.In, the average month-end price was $174/t. Thereafter, the average price fell every year from 2013-to 2019. By the Spring of 2020, phosphate rock (along with many other commodities) began marching higher. So, a ton of hay

The phosphate mining carried out partly by Nauru, but mostly by Australian and British companies, had rendered most of the island both uninhabitable and infertile (about 80% of the surface of the island) by the 1960s, leaving everything but the coastal strip uninhabitable (Klein 2014).

## Upgrading Phosphate Ores with Rotary Kilns
The organic components must be combusted in order to produce an upgraded/purified form of phosphate ore. Rotary kilns can be used to decompose and remove organic materials such as kerogen found with phosphate rock. This process is often referred to as calcination, though it does not meet the technical definition of the term.

8.1. Mining of phosphate ore. The first commercial production of phosphate rock began in England in 1847 and mining was undoubtedly by hand methods. Phosphate mining began in the United States in South Carolina in 1867. Platy phosphate rock beds were mined by hand and later by dredges; sorting was mainly by hand.

Phosphate ore is an important raw material for manufacturing fertilizers and phosphorous chemical products. While most of the phosphate resources cannot be directly treated as feed stock due to the low grade of P2O5 and high content of impurities. In order to obtain a qualified phosphate concentrate, the beneficiation of the low-grade phosphate ore is, hence, of great necessity. Many

The P 2 O 5 content in phosphate ores varies from 2-6 to 25-34 percent, depending on the processing behavior, mining and geological conditions, and other factors. Phosphate ores are divided into two major groups of natural formations—phosphorites and apatites. Less often, aluminum phosphates, iron phosphates, and guano serve as phosphate

Phosphate Beneficiation. Definition of "Beneficiation": This is the second step in the mining process, after removal of the ore from the ground.
