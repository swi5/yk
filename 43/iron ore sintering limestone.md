In fact, a major part of the iron ores consumed rely on imports. Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa, etc. are the main iron ore exporters, and the long-term data show that the iron ores imported by China have even exceeded 90% of the iron ores consumed [2]. However, the high utilization of imported iron ores has also given rise to some

## How to Achieve Uniform Sinter Quality - Analyzing Metals
Sinter is the primary feed material for making iron in a blast furnace. During the iron ore sintering process in iron and steel manufacturing, sinter is created by mixing iron ore concentrate with several additives such as limestone and silica to control the chemistry and then igniting it at 1200Â°C in a continuous belt-fed furnace. The production of high-quality sinter is crucial for assuring

Iron Ore Sinter. Iron ore sinter - A bulk material for blast-furnace smelting, which is made by sintering ore, limestone, fine coke, screened sinter and blast-furnace dust on special belt sintering machines. Sinter quality is determined by the Fe content of iron ore, strength, destruction during heating and reduction in a blast furnace.

## Why limestone is added in the extraction of lead from galena?
Solution: During the extraction of iron from haematite ore, limestone acts as a flux. Limestone decomposes froming CaO which reacts with silica forming slag. Why is limestone added to the blast furnace during iron extraction? Limestone is also used to remove impurities from the blast furnace when making iron. The impurities are mostly silicon

## iron ore sintering limestone
Iron is produced in blast furnaces by the reduction of iron bearing materials with a hot gas. The large, refractory lined furnace is charged through its top with iron as ore, pellets, and/or sinter; flux as limestone, dolomite, and sinter; and coke for fuel. Iron oxides, coke and fluxes react with the. Read More

This results in increased recovery of calibrated lump ore and thus reducing overall production cost. Recovery of 2mm - 20mm calibrated iron ore considerably improves the overall economics. Processed minus 2mm recovered as a by-product is suitable for sinter feed or for pelletizing; Processed Iron Ore increases campaign life

## Sintering Characteristics of Iron Ore Blends Containing High 
Granulation and sintering are the two most important steps of the iron ore agglomeration process to produce sintered ore. Since granulation takes place at room temperature and is mainly characterized by physical and interfacial phenomena, while sintering is a thermal densification process involving extensive chemical reactions, the characteristics of the ore blends during these processes are
