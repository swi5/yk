01. SISHEN - One of the largest open-pit mines in the world - some 14km long - and the heart of our South African iron ore business. Located in Northern Cape and 73.9% owned by Kumba Iron Ore. See Sishen for yourself. 02. KOLOMELA - Located around 90km south of our Sishen mine, the name 'Kolomela' means to dig deeper.

## Process of Steel-making from Iron Ore
Its production process is basically similar, melting pig iron into hot metal and then adding some substances in the hot metal, such as oxygen, and iron ore, which makes it react with the carbon in the hot metal so as to reduce the carbon content in the hot metal. Then pour the purified hot metal into the mold and make it into steel after cooling.

Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

## concentrate iron ore process production
The iron ore concentrate production and distribution system includes the processes of mining production, ore dressing production, warehouse stocking, and distribution. The goal is to minimize the total costs of the whole system, such as mining costs, mineral processing/dressing, inventory, and transportation.

Iron ore tailings (IOTs) are a form of solid waste produced during the beneficiation process of iron ore concentrate. In this paper, iron recovery from IOTs was studied at different points during a process involving pre-concentration followed by direct reduction and magnetic separation. Then, slag-tailing concrete composite admixtures were prepared from high-silica residues. Based on the

## Iron Concentrate - Eco - English Wiki
Dec 20, 2021Iron Concentrate is created by purifying Crushed Iron Ore. This can be done in one of two ways: either dry or wet purification, each of which can be performed using one of two crafting stations. The crafting stations come with different ratios, labor cost and time. The process to make Iron Concentrate also gives a by-product of either Tailings or Wet Tailings, each of which are pollutants.
