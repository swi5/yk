## How Heavy Should Your Concrete Polishing Machine Be?
A light-duty machine may make a great second machine to follow the larger unit with fast-speed polishing steps or to polish those slabs that do not need any grinding or grouting. However, I would recommend that the contractor first buy a good heavy-duty piece of equipment that is designed for grinding and polishing.

## 5 Types of Concrete Crushers for Recycling Concrete Blocks
Jul 20, 2022Excavator concrete crusher can make it easy to process concrete mixed with mud and scrap. It is made of high-strength wear-resistant steel, which can be directly installed or hooked to the excavator, which greatly improves the versatility of the excavator. It is mostly used for the removal of concrete slabs, walls and bridge decks.
