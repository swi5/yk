## The Environmental Impact of Spodumene Mining
The Environmental Impact of Spodumene Mining. As the world moves away from a hydrocarbon economy and towards one based on renewable energy sources like solar or wind power, it is critical that we consider how these changes will impact our environment. Resources such as lithium are becoming more valuable in this new climate due to their ability

Due to its high reactivity lithium is not found in its native state. It's main sources are igneous rocks and brine. The main igneous rocks used as sources of lithium are: • Spodumene (LiAlSi 2 O 6) - The most abundant and important of the lithium containing ores. Found in North America, Brazil, USSR, Spain, Africa, and Argentina.

## Spodumene Prices | Benchmark Minerals
As a source of lithium, spodumene falls at the start of the lithium-ion battery supply chain. It is the product of mining and mineral extraction, and the lithium carbonate extracted from spodumene is a key ingredient for making battery components. Lithium carbonate extraction is a costly operation involving a series of metallurgical processes.

Li-6 is a source of tritium for nuclear fusion, through low-energy nuclear fission. Lithium is the lightest metal, which occurs in several hard rock types, notably spodumene, and in brines, hence it is often mined in salt lakes, particularly in South America. In 2015 production was evenly split between brines and hard rock.

Over 145 minerals contain lithium, but only five (spodumene, lepidolite, petalite, amblygonite, and eucryptite) are utilized in lithium extraction. Of those five, spodumene provides the largest proportion of all mineral-derived lithium. In 2011, spodumene yielded 12,500 tons of lithium, while the other sources provided only about 1,500 tons.

Lithium is extracted from spodumene by fusing in acid. 3) World production of lithium via spodumene is around 80,000 metric tonnes per annum, primarily from the Greenbushes pegmatite of Western Australia

## is spodumene a good source of lithium
Spodumene is the most commonly occurring lithium hard-rock mineral, which, once upon a time, made it the number one source of lithium metal in the world. It has since been surpassed by brines, which, for a number of reasons, have become the largest contributor to lithium production.
