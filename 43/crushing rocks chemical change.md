## Is pulverizing of rock salt a chemical change? - ameasy
Dissolving salt in water may be written as a chemical reaction, where sodium chloride dissociates into Na + ions and Cl - ions in water. When salt dissolves, the ionic bonds between the atoms break. The reactant (sodium chloride or NaCl) differs from the products (sodium and chloride ions), so a chemical change occurs.
