The thickness of your paint is 120 micrometer. You have been able to measure this with a paint thickness gauge. The primer has a thickness of 20 micrometer. The colored coat has a thickness of 60 micrometer. The clear coat has a thickness of 40 micrometer. Every time you polish the surface you will remove a very fine layer of the surface.

## Mil thickness compared to mm (millimeter) and inches
Plastic sheeting is measured in mils. A mil is a measurement that equals one-thousandth of an inch, or 0.001 inch. One mil also equals 0.0254 mm (millimeter). Thus a mil is not the same thickness as a millimeter. The term "mil" is not an abbreviation but a unit of measure.The chart below gives you an idea of mils to millimeters to inches.

## How to Calculate Cement, Sand Quantity for Plastering?
Plastering thickness 12 mm = 12/1000 = 0.012m. Volume of cement mortar required = ( Plastering Area x thickness ) = 100 m 2 x 0.012m = 1.2 m 3 (This is wet volume that means we need this much volume of cement mortar after mixing water, So for dry volume, we have to add 30-35% as bulkage of sand, we are using 35% and wastage as 20%)
