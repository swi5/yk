## Spiritual Meaning of the Color White White symbolizes innocence, purity 
The image of gold in our dreams illuminates the spirit as one of the highest stages of spiritual development. The first is black (shadow side of the dreamer) sin or fault; than transforms to white - purity and remission; then red - vitality and passion. The color gold/yellow may also be associated with the solar plexus charka or third.

## Minerals - Gekko Systems
The ever-increasing global demand for valuable minerals requires safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible mining. Gekko Systems are world leaders in gravity separation and recovery of gold and complex gold. Gekko's unique core technologies and innovative flowsheets also efficiently extract other high-value minerals, such as silver, coal, polymetallics and gemstones.

## Gold Gravity Concentration - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The object of gravity concentration is the separation of the heavy valuable mineral from the light worthless gangue. Complications are often introduced by the fact that various base minerals must be separated from one another, an ore being subdivided into several products. Most gold ores, however, only require separation into two parts—the

The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

Gold Ore is a fairly rare ore found in Minecraft, typically found in veins of 1 to 9, from y=0 to y=31 in all biomes, and in veins of one to nine from y=28 to y=80 within a badlands biome. The ore itself is dropped when mined with an iron pickaxe or better. It has little use in tools and armor, since the durability is very low. Gold Ore can be smelted in a (blast) furnace to make gold ingots
