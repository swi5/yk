The process of making iron and steel in the mill begins with the melting of iron in huge blast furnaces, which are water-cooled steel cylinders that are heated by blasts from other dome-topped cylinders known as stoves. These furnaces can often be over 10 stories high. Before automation, many jobs were involved in steel mill processes.
