## Heavy metals and rare earth elements in phosphate fertilizer  - PubMed
The contents of heavy metals Fe, Zn, Co, Cr and Sc as well as rare earth elements La, Ce, Hf, Eu, Yb and Sm were determined in four samples representing the phosphate fertilizer components (e.g. rock phosphate, limestone and sulfur). These samples were collected from the Abu-Zabal phosphate factory in El-Qalubia governarate, Egypt.

Generally, phosphate rock contains about 0.05 wt% rare earth elements (REEs) on average. And the world commercial phosphate rock production is estimated to be 250 million tons per year, that makes phosphate rock a potential new REEs resource. However, low content of REEs in phosphate rock leads to the technical challenges and cost overages, that hindered the commercial recovery of REEs.

The lightest of metals may be causing the largest of impacts. Lithium, which powers our phones, laptops, and electric cars, is essential to our battery-driven world. The demand for lithium has rapidly increased, as the global market's annual consumption has risen by 8.9 percent annually. This demand will only intensify as hybrid and electric

Over a single year, producing 60,000 tons of lithium at the site could mean digging up as much as 20 to 30 million tons of earth. According to Mining , battery-grade lithium carbonate is up 95 percent thus far in 2022, and a whopping 472 percent over the course of the past 12 months..

## Recovery of rare earth elements from phosphate rock by 
Generally, phosphate rock contains about 0.05 wt% rare earth elements (REEs) on average. And the world commercial phosphate rock production is estimated to be 250 million tons per year, that makes phosphate rock a potential new REEs resource.  The rare earth elements (REEs) are a series of elements with similar physicochemical properties
