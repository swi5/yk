## Mining of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

## Developing a zero-carbon method for processing iron ore
Jul 5, 2022Steel is made from iron, which comes from iron ore, which is a combination of iron oxides (Fe x O y) and various mineral components. The current method for processing iron ore is by melting it in a blast furnace, causing the iron oxide to separate from the other parts of the ore. Hot oxygen interacts with coal in the furnace to create carbon
