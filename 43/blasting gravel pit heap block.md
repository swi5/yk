## Block Caving
Overview. Block caving is an underground hard rock mining method that involves undermining an ore body, allowing it to progressively collapse under its own weight. It is the underground version of open pit mining. In block caving, a large section of rock is undercut, creating an artificial cavern that fills with its own rubble as it collapses.

## FAQ Aggregate Blasting - Explosives and Aggregate - Illinois
When a blast is detonated, some of the energy travels through the ground as vibration. The ground vibration travels mainly on the surface at varying speeds depending upon the density and thickness of the geology. Although perceptible, the energy level decreases rapidly with distance. To the blaster, vibration represents wasted explosive energy.

The Heap­Free function requires that the pointer is to an active heap block from the same heap. If you pass a pointer to an already-freed heap block, or to a heap block from some other heap, or to something that isn't a heap block at all, then the behavior is undefined, and anything at all can happen.
