This saves mining operations multiple millions in USD every month since iron ore beneficiation increases significantly the costs per ton of ore. Control of the moisture content on the mining conveyor belt (NIR) together with accurate monitoring of the composition of iron ore before shipment guaranties constant ore quality to avoids penalties.

## Iron ore
Mining iron ore is a high-volume, low-margin business, as the value of iron is significantly lower than base metals. It is highly capital intensive, and requires significant investment in infrastructure such as rail in order to transport the ore from the mine to a freight ship. For these reasons, iron ore production is concentrated in the hands
