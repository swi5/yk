Cobalt is an expensive metal used in electric car batteries, costing about $35,000 per ton. 59% of cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Cobalt mining in the Congo is often done by children — as many as 40,000 — working in brutal and unsafe conditions. A euphemism for these children is 'informal' workers.

All that could change as peace returns and more of the country falls under the control of the central government in Kinshasa.
