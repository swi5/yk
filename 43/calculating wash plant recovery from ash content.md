## Coal washing | Coal preparation | Coal washing plant pcocess
Clean coal is an energy that can generally be used as fuel, the fine coal of bituminous coal is generally used for coking. The main reasons of washing coal are as bellow: 1. Improve coal quality and reduce emissions of coal-fired pollutants. Coal washing can remove 50%-80% of ash and 30%-40% of total sulfur (or 60%~80% of inorganic sulfur) in coal.

## How to calculate waste heat recovery - Electronic Specifier
The following formula determines if sufficient volume is available for waste heat recovery. Q = S V ρ Cp ΔT. S = Cross sectional area (m 2) of waste flow pipe/ducting V = Flow velocity (m/sec) ρ = Media density (kg/m 3) Cp = specific heat constant of the media (kJ/Kg.°C) ΔT = Temperature difference (°C) 'Q' from the calculation above

## Waste Heat Recovery From Fly Ash of 210 MW Coal Fired Power Plant Using 
Abstract. Combustion of coal in thermal power plants generates ash as a residue, which depends on the quality of coal, specific to its ash content and calorific value. In a typical Indian scenario, a standard 210 MW thermal plant produces ∼57 T/hr total ash, which has 80:20 fly and bottom ash share, considering coal with 40% ash content. This study aims to harness the waste heat of fly ash

## Coal beneficiation: Policy priorities for India | ORF
The government of India has stipulated that, as of June 2016, power plants of capacity of 100 Megawatt (MW) or above, located 500 to 749 kilometres (km) from coal mine pit-heads must utilise raw, blended, or beneficiated coal with ash content of 34 percent or less. The obligation of meeting this target rests with the coal supplier.
