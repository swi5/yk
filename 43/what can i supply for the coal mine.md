Starting in the 1990s, many coal-fired power plants switched to subbituminous coal from the PRB—which has relatively low sulfur content—to meet tightening Clean Air Act emission standards.By 2003, the Powder River Basin yielded more coal than the Appalachian coal basins in the eastern United States.

EIA estimates U.S. recoverable coal reserves at about 252 billion short tons, of which about 58% is underground mineable coal. Recoverable reserves at producing mines are the amount of recoverable reserves that coal mining companies report to EIA for their U.S. coal mines that produced more than 25,000 short tons of coal in a year.
