##  Use of Recycled Concrete Materials in Base/Subbase Applications
-Approx. 1% to 2% passing the #200 from crushing clean concrete pavement -Additional fines come mainly from excavating underlying soils when loading the broken concrete -Gradation specifications should consider: •Underlying material -subgrade vs. treated base •Modify specification as needed (reduce the low end of % passing the #200)
