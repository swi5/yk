## Screw Conveyor: What Is It? How Does It Work? Types, Uses - IQS Directory
Screw conveyors primarily consist of a rotating screw shaft that is installed within a trough. As the screw shaft rotates, the material moves linearly. They can be designed to provide horizontal, vertical, and inclined travel paths. Several types of screw conveyors are designated to handle a specific material behavior.

## Engineering Flexible Screw Conveyors • BulkInside
The overall design concept of flexible screw conveyors is relatively straightforward. However, the simplicity of their design can be somewhat deceiving. Much like a pneumatic conveying system, the efficiency of flexible screw conveyors is highly dependent on initial design, specialized knowledge of material characteristics, and proper calculation of conveyor flow to preserve the life of the auger.
