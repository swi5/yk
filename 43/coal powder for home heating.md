## Coal | National Geographic Society
Coal is a black or brownish-black sedimentary rock that can be burned for fuel and used to generate electricity.It is composed mostly of carbon and hydrocarbons, which contain energy that can be released through combustion (burning). Coal is the largest source of energy for generating electricity in the world, and the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States.

## Desulfurization mechanism of high-sulfur coal by heating reduced iron 
The effects of the heating temperature, heating time, and coal-to-iron powder ratio on desulfurization were investigated. The morphology of sulfur in high-sulfur coal before and after desulfurization was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

## How to Use Coal for Home Heating: Advantages and Disadvantages - STEPBYSTEP
Coal is heavy and must be transported by truck. That can add significantly to the cost. A rough comparison is that a ton of coal equals 100 gallons of fuel oil. If you use 500 gallons of heating oil a season, then you will need about 5 tons of coal. So the oil is going to cost a minimum of $400 for 100 gallons and coal sells for $100 to $300 a

## Storing Coal for Home Heating at Your Retreat
Best of all, there are no storage problems. You can leave it in a pile, or bury it in a hole. It will keep and will not degrade. Coal is very cheap. If possible, get a low sulfur anthracite coal. However, if your budget is tight, you can get a higher sulfur coal. The concern would be corrosion in your stove pipe.

## Powdered Coal - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
For the casting of iron, powdered coal additions or coal substitutes are usually added to greensands to improve surface finish in this way, providing a carbon layer to both the sand grains and the liquid surface. The reactions in the pyrolysis of coal were originally described by Kolorz and Lohborg (1963):. 1. The volatiles are driven out of the coal to form a reducing atmosphere.

## Coal explained - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
The ranking depends on the types and amounts of carbon the coal contains and on the amount of heat energy the coal can produce. The rank of a coal deposit is determined by the amount of pressure and heat that acted on the plants over time. Anthracite contains 86%-97% carbon and generally has the highest heating value of all ranks of coal
