## Medet Mining and Processing Complex
The Medet Mining and Processing Complex was the largest open pit copper mine in Europe and the third largest in the world at that time. It was the first to organize open pit mining and processing of copper ores with cut-off grade lower than 0,4 % - a practice which was later widely applied in the industry. The approach for Medet building was

## Mining | National Geographic Society
Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

## Copper Mining Using Acidothiobacillus - microbewiki
Copper is rarely found in its native form; most often it exists as ores made up of various copper sulfides and oxides that have little practical value of their own (Australian Atlas of Minerals, Resources, and Processing Centres). As such, methods for mining copper involve long and complex chemical processes to produce metal from the ores.

## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing (2022)
Copper process : The concentration of copper in ores averages only 0.6%, and most profitable ores are sulfides, especially chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and to a lesser extent chalcocite (Cu 2 S). These minerals are intense from crushed ores to the level of 10 to 15% copper by froth flotation or bioleaching.

• Recycling a tonne of copper uses 20% of the energy that would be used to mine and extract the same copper. • The copper recycling process has much in common as that to extract it, but requires fewer steps. High-purity copper is melted in a furnace and then reduced; Low-purity copper is refined through electroplating in sulfuric acid.

Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods.

## Copper Mining and Processing
At this mine site, it is over 100 degrees F over 100 days per year. Scene from the copper process plant, the electrowinning cells where the copper is plated onto cathodes from the sulferic acid solution. Each line in the cell is a plate. There are thousands of plates in this photo. The overhead crane is used to remove the solid copper cathodes.
