## Coal and the Blast Furnace - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
A temporary coal preparation plant was installed to prepare the coal properly for injection into the blast furnace. Because the injection system would only function on dry coals, shipments were made in covered hopper railroad cars. The coal was moved from the railroad cars to the crusher by a track unloading conveyor and an inclined conveyor.

The blast furnace uses coke, iron ore and limestone to produce pig iron. Coal traditionally has been a key part of the coke-making process. The coal is crushed and ground into a powder and then charged into an oven where it is heated to approximately 1800°F in the absence of oxygen. As the oven is heated, the coal begins to melt so most of the

## Blast Furnace: Introduction, Definition, Construction, Working 
A blast furnace is a special type of cylindrical furnace, which is basically used for the purpose of smelting. So, the industrial metals can be extracted from their ores like iron, pig iron, or copper. The word 'blast' gives the idea of combustion air which is forcefully supplied or produced to the atmospheric pressure above.

In 1989, the last blast furnace in Johnstown was tapped - and this is the photograph of that event. After this, Bethlehem changed to electric furnaces that were used to melt scrap steel. This safety crew worked in the mines. Notice the lights on the fronts of their hard hats. Mules were originally used to haul the coal out of the mines.

A blast furnace smelts items at a speed of one item every 100 game ticks (5 seconds) or twelve items per minute, which is twice as fast as a standard furnace. It also serves as an armorer's job site block. A blast furnace can be picked up by any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it

## Understanding Pulverized Coal Injection in Blast Furnace
Pulverization of coal is carried out in a single or multiple grinding mills (pulverizers) depending on the requirements. Grinding and distribution of the coal to the injection lances constitute a major operating cost. Coal reclaimed from coal storage is screened for the removal of the foreign material and any large lump of coal is crushed.

## Pulverized Coal Injection in a Blast Furnace - IspatGuru
Pulverized coal injection (PCI) is a process which involves injecting large volumes of fine coal particles into the raceway of the blast furnace (BF). Pulverized coal is an important auxiliary fuel used in the BF ironmaking. PCI provides auxiliary fuel for partial coke replacement and has proven both economically and environmentally favourable.
