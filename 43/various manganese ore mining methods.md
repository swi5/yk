Manganese (Mn) is a gray-white to silvery metal with a moderate melting temperature and relatively high specific gravity (7.2 to 7.4). Manganese is added to iron along with other metals and carbon, to make steel. Manganese never occurs as the native metal in nature, but instead in some combination with other elements.

Mining Methods. There are four key stages of work involved in mining for minerals. These include: 3415, 3416 Prospecting - The purpose of this stage is to identify areas that are likely to contain mineral deposits. The work includes geological, geochemical and geophysical surveys (e.g. seismic surveying), aerial surveys, including the taking of samples by low-impact mechanical methods.
