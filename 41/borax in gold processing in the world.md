## Borax method
The borax method is a technique of artisanal gold mining,  The method is increasingly being seen as a safe alternative to the widespread use of toxic mercury in artisanal gold mining today. About 30% of the world's mercury emissions comes from small scale mining. Efforts are being made to revive the method and spread its use.  The process

It's not smart to melt the recovered gold. Regardless of how hard you work, it won't be pure enough to be considered as having been refined. The process you used should be considered a recovery process, not a refining process. You should have dissolved the recovered gold, then filtered and precipitated to purify (refine).

One of the earliest was a simple sheepskin left in a river to collect gold flecks within its fleece, leading to the myth of the Golden Fleece. This method, along with many others, was eventually replaced by amalgamation, a process whereby mercury captures fine-grained gold by forming an amalgam with the precious metal.

## Gold Extraction / Mining | Goldfo
Extraction of Gold using the Borax Process. The borax process is also an environmentally-friendly method of extracting gold. Here the gold-bearing rock material is placed in a melting crucible and then borax (sodium borate) is added. The borax sinks the melting point of the ore mixture and makes the molten mass more fluid.
