As the top stone rotates, the grain first gets cracked in the middle of the two stones, then is pushed to the outside by the spoke-like pattern.

## wat was a grind stone made of
A wide range of prehistoric artifacts were formed by pecking, grinding, or polishing one stone with another. Ground stone tools are usually made of basalt, rhyolite, granite, or other macrocrystalline igneous or metamorphic rocks, whose coarse structure makes them ideal for grinding other materials, including plants and other stones.
