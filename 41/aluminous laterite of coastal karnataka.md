## Global view of lateritic soil improvement for  - ScienceDirect
In nature, both laterites commonly occur in aluminous laterite and iron-rich laterite. In India laterite occurs in different places in a different environments. Laterite is extensively used as a building material in regions of Kerala, Goa, and Karnataka ( Fig. 1 ). There are many lateritic stone quarries on the west coast of India.

The soil Laterite rich in aluminum are termed aluminous laterite or bauxite. Aluminous laterite is formed from clay minerals such as kaolinite (Al4[Si4O10][OH]8) by the leaching of silica (SiO2). The residue left by the leaching of silica, aluminum hydroxide (Al[OH]3), is termed gibbsite. Get Price

In the Paduvari Plateau of coastal Karnataka, the occurrences of aluminous laterite or bauxite (5.0-7.0 m thick) underlain by ferruginous laterite (0.5-1.5m thick) signify that climate was evolved from humid tropical to tropical wet-dry condition in the Paleogene-Neogene Periods (Tardy, 1992, Devaraju and Khanadali, 1993).

## Write a short note on Laterite Soil - Vedantu
The word Laterite is derived from Latin word 'later' which means 'brick'. They are mainly tropical based reason's soil where we have heavy seasonal rainfall and high temperature. Because of that, it promotes leaching of the soil. Due to rain, lime and silica are always leached away. Laterite soils are said to farraginous aluminous rock.

chicken coops plans for sale Bauxite is the name given to aluminium ore. To generate aluminium oxide, bauxite is purified, a white powder from which aluminium can be extracted.Aluminium oxide has a very high melting point of more than 2000° C which makes melting very expensive.Aluminium oxide in water does not dissolve, but in molten cryolite, it dissolves.

Aluminous laterite is formed from clay minerals such as kaolinite (Al4 [Si4O10] [OH]8) by the leaching of silica (SiO2). The residue left by the leaching of silica, aluminum hydroxide (Al [OH]3), is termed gibbsite Gibbsite's dehydrated forms, diaspore and bohemite (both HAlO2), are also common components of aluminous laterite.
