## Basic Information of Air Emissions Factors and Quantification
In most cases, these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages for all facilities in the source category (i.e., a population average). The general equation for emissions estimation is: E = A x EF x (1-ER/100) where: E = emissions; A = activity rate;

There are seasonal variations in the contributions of the PMF-derived sources. Summer undergoes significant contributions of three factors: sea salts, industrial emissions and mineral dust. Spring is affected mainly by industrial emissions and non-exhaust emissions. Winter experiences a drastic contribution of the exhaust emission factor.
