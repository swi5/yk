## Coated (Shell) Sand - Carpenter Brothers, Inc.
Shell sand is coated under heat with a flake thermosetting phenolic resin and catalyst. Shell sand is manufactured and shipped in various packaging options to foundries. The cold, flowable sand is blown into the mold or core pattern cavities preheated to degrees F. The core box is held with sand for the required amount of time to allow the shell sand to set, then rotated to drain the

## USA - Process for producing resin-coated sand particles for use 
A process for producing resin-coated sand particles for use in shell moles wherein a phenolformaldehyde resin in an initial stage of condensation is sprayed into a hot zone to form droplets which gravitationally descend to a cold zone and solidify. The particles are mixed with sand, heated to a temperature above the melting point of the resin and coat the sand.

## Resin Coated Sand, Casting and Production - Iron foundry
The molding process using pre-coated resin sand is also called as shell molding, or hot shell and core molding process. Pre-Coated Resin Sand. Pre-coated resin sand is very fine and solid, so they could make the castings with better surface quality, less sand casting defects, and very high dimensional tolerance. So, they are suitable to produce
