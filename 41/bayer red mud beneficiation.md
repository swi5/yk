The Pederson process is a process of refining aluminum that first separates iron by reducing it to metal, and reacting alumina with lime to produce calcium aluminate, which is then leached with sodium hydroxide. It is more environmentally friendly than the more well-known Bayer process. This is because instead of producing alumina slag, also known as red mud, it produces pig iron as a byproduct.

Iannicelli's solution for red mud is to treat the abundant material with cheap sulfur compounds.

## Recovery of alkali and alumina from Bayer red mud by the calcification 
Red mud produced in the Bayer process is a hazardous solid waste because of its high alkalinity; however, it is rich in valuable components such as titanium, iron, and aluminum. In this study, a novel calcification-carbonation method was developed to recover alkali and alumina from Bayer red mud under mild reaction conditions. Batch experiments were performed to evaluate the potential

## Treating red mud from the Bayer process - a new technology
Canadian clean tech company Orbite Aluminae has developed a patented technology that can treat red mud, the most significant waste product of the traditional Bayer process for aluminium production. The company says it "offers the only ecologically sound and commercially viable alternative to manage and eliminate these toxic residues.".

## Red mud - addressing the problem - Aluminium Insider
The new plant delivers advantages such as savings in caustic soda consumption by 10-15 kg per tonne of alumina, minimising land requirement by 50-60%, eliminating containment of wet red mud and associated environmental hazards. The powder can readily be utilised in cement manufacture as well as in other industries, the company claims.
