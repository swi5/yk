This quartz mining process mainly relies on the friction between mechanical force and quartz particles to wipe away the iron film or adhesive materials in quartz sand surface, at the same time, it can further crush quartz particles. Then use hydrocyclone to separate fine particles from slurry, then obtain higher purity quartz sand.

## How Sandstone is Formed - Gosford Quarries
Sandstone is a rock comprising mostly of minerals formed from sand. The stone gains its formation throughout centuries of deposits forming in lakes, rivers, or on the ocean floor. These elements group together with the minerals quartz or calcite and compresses. In time, the sandstone is formed by the pressure of these minerals coming together.
