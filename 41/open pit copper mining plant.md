## Open-pit vs Underground Mining: What's the difference?
The mined materials from underground are either transported to the surface via trucks or via cable belt to be delivered to the processing plant. In contrast to open-pit or other surface mines where the materials are hauled by trucks directly from the pit. Having said all of this, surface mining methods are obviously relatively easier that's

## The World's 20 Largest Copper Mines - ThoughtCo
The Morenci mine in Arizona is the largest copper mine in North America. Operated by Freeport-McMoRan, the mine is jointly owned by the company (72%) and affiliates of the Sumitomo Corporation (28%). Morenci operations began in 1872, underground mining began in 1881, and open-pit mining began in 1937. ﻿ ﻿

## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
8.2.3.1 Open pit mining. Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.
