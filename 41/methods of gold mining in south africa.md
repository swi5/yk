The second recovery techniques commonly used in ASGM in Africa is gold panning, which is used for placer deposits. The technique is low cost and simple, utilizing a plastic or metal pan and water to separate gold from soil gravel and rocks. Material is placed on the pan then wetted and stirred to break the lumps present.

South Africa's reef deposits, especially gold and platinum-bearing ore bodies, are narrow and tabular. While legislation dictates a minimum operation height of 800 mm in areas where people work, some of the country's narrow reef mines have ore bodies with thicknesses of less than 500 mm, which results in ore dilution, as waste ore with zero economic value is also mined.
