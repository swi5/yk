This process is used for the concentration of particles that have sufficiently different colours (the best contrast being black and white) to be detected by the naked eye. In addition, electro-optic detectors collect data on the responses of minerals when exposed to infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light.

During the condensation process, magmatic crystallization differentiation often occurs. This kind of action can enrich some useful materials and form deposits. It is termed mineralization of magmatic differentiation and magmatic crystallization. Magmatic differentiation and crystalline deposits have developed to a certain extent in this region.

Magmatic iron meteorites show compositional evidence for having formed by fractional crystallization within well-mixed molten metallic cores in differentiated asteroids (13-15).The parent bodies of magmatic iron meteorites are the earliest differentiated asteroids, accreting within ~1 Ma of

## Magmatic Segregation - Mining Fundamentals
Magmatic segregation is an ore-forming process, in which the valuable minerals are concentrated by settling them out from cooling magma. Through the magmatic segregation process, one or more minerals are concentrated locally during the cooling of magma. The rocks that are formed as a result of magmatic segregation are called magmatic cumulates.
