## Aggregate Impact Value Test Procedure as per IS 2386 Part-4 (1963) with 
The aggregate impact value test is an important test of aggregates. It is done to obtain the resistance and impact of aggregates (stones). In this test a machine is used, which is called impact testing machine.

Conclusion. Since the average ACV for the test is less than 30% (16.3%), the aggregate is acceptable for cemented concrete pavements. The load for 10% of fines value for this aggregate is 34.3% and thus the aggregate value for wearing surfaces shall not exceed45% (Bhattacharjee, 2015). References. Bhattacharjee, M. (2015).

## Asphalt
Asphalt, also known as bitumen (UK: / ˈ b ɪ tj ʊ m ɪ n /, US: / b ɪ ˈ tj uː m ə n, b aɪ-/), is a sticky, black, highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum.It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product, and is classed as a pitch.Before the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos.
