## Liner wear and performance investigation of primary gyratory crushers
Due to wear the geometry of the liner will change gradually during the lifetime of the liners, causing changes in crusher capacity and particle size distribution of the crushed material. Related studies have been performed for primary crushers, both Jaw crushers Lindqvist (2005), and gyratory crushers Rosario et al. (2004).

## Primary Crusher Selection & Design - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
A crusher's wear parts need to last as long as operationally-economically possible. Typical numbers are for liner and mantles to have a useful wear-life of almost 2,000,000 tonne on abrasive taconite and 9,000,000 tonnes on porphyry copper ores. Dependability and long service life are landmarks of good primary crusher design of up to 30 yrs.

A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications. Fine liner configurations typically have reduction ratios of 4:1 to 6:1.
