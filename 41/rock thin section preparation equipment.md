## 2.5 Equipment: Thin Section Preparation | Analytical Methods in 
This module provides an overview of equipment used for thin section preparation, including manual polishing techniques. If you have completed readings and watched videos in section 2.4, you may already recognize the equipment described here. This module also describes the specific operation of the equipment at JMU in a series of videos.

## MAKING THIN SECTIONS BY HAND - Lunar and Planetary Laboratory
Many is the time I found a rock that only looked mildly promising and upon making the thin section found it to be abundantly rich in fauna. I have yet to find a promising rock that proved to be uninteresting. Cutting the specimen out. Back in the lab (read garage or basement!) cut off a piece of one end of the rock. The harder the rock is the

Better throw down for Plaster weld before you skim the whole wall or at least bust off the shine with 80 grit.

## Preparing a Thin Section of a Rock - National Petrographic
A thin section of rock is prepared so mineralogists and petrologists can identify, study, and analyze the material more closely. This is known as thin section preparation. Using this method, you can classify minerals, identify problems in quarries or structures, examine mineral potential in geological environments, and identify the geographical source of archaeological artifacts.

## Equipment Used for Petrography and Thin Section - National Petrographic
A thin section is a laboratory preparation of a rock, bone, soil, pottery, mineral, or metal sample for petrography, optical mineralogy, polarization microscopy, and microstructural analysis. A sliver is cut from the specimen with a diamond saw, mounted on a glass slide, and then ground and polished smooth until it's only 30 micrometers thick.
