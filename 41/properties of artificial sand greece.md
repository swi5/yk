## Impact compression properties of artificial cemented sand material 
In order to explore the mechanical properties of rock with deep in-situ stress under explosive impact, cemented sand material (artificial material) instead of rock was used to carry out impact dynamics test under the condition of confining pressure. The experimental results show that the stress-strain curve of cemented sand specimens tested by triaxial impact compression changes significantly

## Physical Properties Of Artificial Sand
 Aggregate Properties Physical Properties Absoprtion Porosity and Permeability usually natural sand. The Standard Specifications detail the requirements for crushed materials for various uses. The coating may be of natural origin such as mineral deposits formed in sand and gravel by ground water or may be artificial such as dust

## artificial sand properties
Properties Of Artificial Sand Dec. Artificial Sandstone Cores Production With A Wide Range Of. Jan 01 In this work grain size cementing material percent and compaction pressure were varied to produce cores with different properties Sand grains The used sand was brought from Kharje area 80 Km south to Riyadh It is a red to brown colored uniformly sorted sand with only 2 of the grains

## physical properties of artificial sand in concrete
This paper studies the early mechanical properties of artificial sand concrete, we found by comparison with natural sand concrete that the slump of artificial sand concrete were increased by 85, and the strength 0f 16h and 1d and3d were increased by 23.Therefore, artificial sand can significantly improve the workability of concrete mix, improve
