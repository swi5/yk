The river rock we have in stock is GREAT for replacing mulch in flowerbeds or around trees, drainage applications, and dry creek beds. We have about 6 types of river rock to choose from ranging in size from ¾" to 8". The river rock coverage is approx. 40 - 60 sq ft per ton at 3″ depth and approx. 60 - 80 sq ft per ton at 2″ depth. Temperatures are expected to drop drastically.
