## It is important that you check your device voltage. Although your plugs 
It is important that you check your device voltage. Although your plugs can fit in the outlets in Thailand, the voltage might not be compatible. Japan and majority of the countries in central America use 110Volts while Thailand has 240 Volts. If you plug a device operated at 100Volts to a 240 volts ply, you will fry it.

Power generation from coal has long served German industry, and despite Germany's reputation as an ecological role model, the cheap, carbon-intensive fossil fuel is still an important pillar of the country's power supply. Hard coal and lignite have a share of 35.3 percent in German power production (compared to 35.2% from renewables, 11.7% from nuclear and 12.8% from natural gas in 2018).

## Brown coal mining in Germany - TwistingSpokes
According to Wikipedia: "Lignite, often referred to as brown coal, is a soft brown combustible sedimentary rock that is formed from naturally compressed peat. It is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content. 25.7% of Germany's electricity comes from lignite power plants."
