## Health Dangers of Grinding and Deburring Dust | Diversitech
Creating a work environment that gives workers the ability to capture and filter grinding and deburring dust at the source, is the key to safe prevention. The degree of risk to workers is determined by factors such as the length of exposure, the type of material being worked with, the type of protection and the effectiveness of that protection.
