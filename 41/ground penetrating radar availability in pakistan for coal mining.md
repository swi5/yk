Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was also used as an aid to resistivity measurement. In GPR, electromagnetic waves propagate in definite pulses from transmitting antenna into the ground and then scatter/reflect at dielectric boundaries such as buried objects, subsurface features, bedding interfaces, and are detected back by a receiver (Conyers and Goodman 1997; Cammarano et al. 1998; Conyers

## Ground-penetrating radar
Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a geophysical method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. It is a non-intrusive method of surveying the sub-surface to investigate underground utilities such as concrete, asphalt, metals, pipes, cables or masonry. This nondestructive method uses electromagnetic radiation in the microwave band (UHF/VHF frequencies) of the radio spectrum, and detects
