The pictures below show that quarry, and beach rip rap, which is one use of the limestone. Most of the limestone is transported from this quarry by truck, but some is still moved by rail. In addition to limestone, Michigan also produces pure lime as well. Lime is purified limestone, and is often of more value to industry than is limestone.

## A Day in the Life: What Goes On at a Quarry - MDLPA
The quarrying process is also known as "extraction.". This procedure consists of removing blocks or large pieces of stone from a previously identified geological deposit. The different methods used to quarry or extract the limestone depends on the specific properties of the limestone deposit itself, including density, bedding planes, and depth.

Limestone is by definition a rock that contains at least 50% calcium carbonate in the form of calcite by weight. All limestones contain at least a few percent other materials. These can be small particles of quartz, feldspar, or clay minerals delivered to the site by streams, currents and wave action.
