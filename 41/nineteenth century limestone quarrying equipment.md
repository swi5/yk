## Limestone: Rock Uses, Formation, Composition, Pictures - Geology
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.

It also took some skill to attempt to recreate an old 1890s town. In addition to the limestone, Texas Flagstone was employed in random pieces for the porch of the bank building and was also used as paving for the sidewalk.

When burned, it produces lime (calcium oxide) and carbon dioxide. Kilns, 28 to 36 feet high and eight feet in diameter, used wood or coal to burn limestone. In the nineteenth century, Knox County's kilns were primarily wood fired. A kiln was loaded with a cord of wood at the bottom, and then filled with limestone broken into head-sized pieces.

For more than 60 years -- from 1860 until the 1920s -- San Juan County was the principal lime-producing area in the state of Washington. The San Juan Islands were ideal for the manufacture and transport of lime. Large deposits of high-quality limestone were located right on the shoreline with good deep-water harbors protected from prevailing winds.
