## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.

Ball Mills. In ceramics, ball mills are used to grind down materials into very fine particles. Materials such as clay and glaze components can be broken down in a ball mill by getting placed into rotating or rolling jars with porcelain balls inside them. During milling, the porcelain balls pulverized the materials into an incredibly fine powder.

## Ball Mill Design/Power Calculation - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The approximate horsepower HP of a mill can be calculated from the following equation: HP = (W) (C) (Sin a) (2Ï) (N)/ 33000. where: W = weight of charge. C = distance of centre of gravity or charge from centre of mill in feet. a = dynamic angle of repose of the charge. N = mill speed in RPM. HP = A x B x C x L. Where.
