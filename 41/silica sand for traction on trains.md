## Silica Sand For Traction On Trains
Silica sand is shipped in unit trains, typically about 110-car trains. Local train traffic may increase by a single train every one to three days. Statewide, 2.5 sand trains are added daily to a statewide rail traffic count of approximately 150 trains per day. Barges. Barges transport a relatively small amount of silica sand, approximately 30

## Railroad Worker Silica Exposures - Diesel Injury Law
Silica is also used by railroads in locomotive sanding systems. Sand is crucial because it provides friction, helping locomotives gain traction when pulling and helping to stop the train in emergencies. Railroads fill sand towers near their locomotive shops or service tracks where locomotives are fueled and sanded.

The chemical compound silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula SiO2. It has been known for its hardness since antiquity. Silica is most commonly found in nature as sand or quartz, as well as in the cell walls of diatoms. Silica is manufactured in several forms including fused quartz, crystal, fumed

## Indian Railway Context - Sanding to improve adhesion - RailElectrica
Quality of Sand. Quality of sand plays an important role in improving the adhesion, not from 35% to 40% but 05-15% to 25% so that train can negotiate the gradient at a lesser speed. No studies have been done by Indian Railways to establish the right quality of sand and depending only on the works done by developed railway systems.

## Add Grit/Sand to Deck Stain for Traction - Fine Homebuilding
Stain is basically some sort of liquid (oil, water, etc) that is carrying dyes and/or pigments. In general, the liquid is designed to evaporate (or to polymerize into the wood), leaving the colorants behind. With no film in which sand particles might be trapped. One alternative is to paint the ramp with an unobtrusive color, adding grit to that.

## Our traction sand for locomotives are wheel impact resistant
For maximum traction! JETMAG® 16-60 is a highly efficient traction sand for locomotives. Its angular grains ensure maximum traction in both acceleration and braking phases. Its high level of hardness and tolerance to extreme heat translate into high impact resistance under wheels for maximum efficiency under all kinds of conditions.

## Borosilicate glassafia
Borosilicate glass is a type of glass with the main glass-forming constituents' silica and boron oxide.Borosilicate glasses are known for having very low coefficients of thermal expansion (∼5 × 10 −6 / °C at 20 °C) making them resistant to thermal shock more so than any other common glass..Even tiny cracks and abrasions can cause glassware to fail under high temperatures and pressures.

## How do locomotive sanders work? Discussion
When the silica (sand) is crushed between the wheel and rail, there is a plasma arc that is set up that attracts the wheel and rail to each other. This in a way temporarily "welds" the wheel and rail together. This "weld" action is broken by the effort of the traction motors and the weight and momentum of the Locomotive.
