## What is the best material to use when creating a can crusher?
Standard cans like soda / beer / tin cans? You can use standard mild steel with proper corrosion protection. Maybe cover the wear surfaces (gripping the can) with rubber sheet. The trick is to apply the force off-center, or to use a lock-twist-and-crush action. The rubber surfaces should also help to grip the cans Yes it is for standard cans.

## Crushers - QueensMineDesignWiki
Crushers play an important role in the material handling process for underground mine operations. The main purpose of a crusher is the size reduction of the feed. This size reduction is achieved by applying a force to the material, creating cracks in the material which in the end will cause the material to break into smaller pieces.

## How it Works: Crushers, Grinding Mills and Pulverizers
Rock crusher. Material is reduced by crushers and grinders by fracturing, which takes place when the material is put under stress by the moving parts of the crushing or grinding equipment. Forces applied during the process may be compressive, shear or impact. The material fractures when the internal strain levels reach a critical level.
