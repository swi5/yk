## Crushing or Crush Concrete Cubes or Cylinder at 28 days
The crushing of concrete cubes or cylinder samples is required in a construction especially concrete structures. The reason why this is to verify the strength given in the design mix. Let say for example for a concrete column commonly it has 60 megapascals of specified strength. When you crush it, the result should be equal or more than 60 Mpa. The specified strength should be achieved at 28
