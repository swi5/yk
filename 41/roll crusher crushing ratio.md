## Diameter of Roll Crusher for the Given Feed and Product Size
Feb 4, 2022A pair of rolls is to take a feed equivalent to spheres of 3 cm in diameter and crush them to spheres having 1 cm diameter. If the coefficient of friction is 0.29, what would be the diameter of rolls? Calculations: The following formula relates the coefficient of friction (μ), radius of rolls (r), radius of product (d), and radius of feed (R):

## EPA2 - Roll crusher and crushing method in use for the roll 
A roll crusher having a pair of rolls facing each other, in which feed material to be crushed is fed into a space or a crushing chamber formed in between these rolls, and the pair of rolls rolls up the material to compress and crush. During the process of crushing, the crushing clearance of rolls is set to 0.6 to 2.4 times 80% passing size of feed material, and feed rate is limited so that
