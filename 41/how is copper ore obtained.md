Copper has a melting point of 1357K and a boiling point of 2835K, along with a density of 8.96 grams per cubic centimeter. It can be obtained by smelting Chalcopyrite, Tetrahedrite, or Malachite, or as a byproduct of ore processing for Malachite or Gold. Processing Copper Ore results in Cobalt, Gold, Nickel, and Cobalt-60 as byproducts.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

Raw copper is a raw metal resource obtained from mining copper ore. Copper ore and deepslate copper ore mined with a stone pickaxe or better drops 2-5 units of raw copper. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune, it can drop extra raw copper, allowing for a maximum of 20 units per ore block with Fortune III, or an average of 7.7 units of raw copper per ore block.

Sulfide Copper Ores . Virtually all sulfide-type copper ores, including chalcocite (Cu 2 S), chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and covellite (CuS), are treated by smelting. After crushing the ore to a fine powder, it is concentrated by froth flotation, which requires mixing the powdered ore with reagents that combine with the copper to make it hydrophobic.

Most copper ore is mined or extracted as copper sulfides. Copper is then obtained by smelting and leaching. Finally, the resulting crude copper is purified by electrolysis involving plating onto pure copper cathodes. Isotopes: Copper has 24 isotopes whose half-lives are known, with mass numbers 57 to 80.

Answer. pi227. First the sulphide ore is heated in the presence of air to give Copper Oxide. This process is known as ROASTING OF ORE. Since Cu is higher up in the reactivity series, it gives oxides on roasting. 2CuS + 3O2 —> 2CuO + 2SO2. The Copper Oxide is now heated to give impure Copper. 2CuO + 3O2 —> 6Cu + SO2.
