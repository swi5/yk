## Diversifying Investment Opportunities in Silica Sand in Malaysia
Also known as white sand, quartz sand or industrial sand, silica sand is a combination of two elements - silica and oxygen. It comes in a wide range of shades, mostly white or colourless. The colour of the sand depends on the rock detritus and the minerals that make up the resource. The quartz material in the sand, in particular, is obtained from sources like beach dunes before it is

Silica Dehumidifiers. The other major application of silica gel are in non-electric dehumidifiers. By creating an entrance to a set of gel beads that air can get to, the silica dehumidifier can absorb the humidity over a longer period of time. These are often placed in a set-and-forget manner for cars, RVs, gun safes, and sheds.
