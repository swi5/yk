## SNIM Open Pit Iron Ore Mining - Mauritania - Mining Technology
Open-pit mining of direct shipping hematite ore, using rotary drills, small shovels and trucks, commenced in 1963 at F'Derik, Rouessa and Tazadit. Primary and secondary crushing is done at Tazadit and the ore is railed to Nouadhibou in trains of up to 220 cars, each carrying 84t. The ore is stockpiled then reclaimed, crushed and screened for

## Types of Iron Ore: Hematite vs. Magnetite_SMM - Shanghai Metals Market
In Asia, a great deal of mining for hematite ore is done in China. Known reserves include the Tung-Yeh-Chen hematite deposit and the Dongye hematite deposit. One of the major advantages hematite ore has over other types like magnetite is its high iron content. That makes the iron extraction process much less costly and time consuming.

## Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineral - Geology
Hematite is the world's most important ore of iron. Although magnetite contains a higher percentage of iron and is easier to process, hematite is the leading ore because it is more abundant and present in deposits in many parts of the world. Hematite is mined in some of the largest mines in the world.

## Hematite - Mining Fundamentals
Hematite - Mining Fundamentals. Hematite is a heavy and relatively hard ferric oxide mineral, which crystallizes in a rhombohedral system. The mineral has derived its name from the Greek word for blood, as it often observed in red powdered form. Hematite has the same crystal structure as that of corundum and ilmenite.

## The Properties of Hematite - Rock tumbler
Hematite is a very common iron oxide mineral (Fe2O3) that is found in rocks throughout the world. It is the most commonly-mined ore of iron. The steel used to make your car, furniture and even the nails in your home was probably made from iron produced by mining hematite. It is a very important mineral. We Review These Properties Below.

Hematite is the principle ore of iron. Huge quantities are mined throughout the world for industrial production. It is the source for roughly 90 percent of all iron mined in the United States. Hematite was largely used in the past as a red and brown pigment, although nowadays cheaper sources have been substituted.

It was associated with goethite and an array of phosphate minerals (Chamberlain, 1877, Hawley and Beavens, 1934; U.S.G.S., 1976; Paull, 1977). It was mined along Iron Ridge near Mayville in Sec. 12 and 13 T.11N R.16E until the mid-1970's. Beds up to 55 feet thick occurred.
