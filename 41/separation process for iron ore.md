Besides, the separation machines are devide into the dry and wet magnetic separation. Generally, iron ore with an iron content of 35% can increase iron content by 20% after magnetic separation. Such a combined process method, the ore utilization rate can reach 90%. In the process of magnetic separation, it saves water, reduces cost and pollution.

Magnetic separation is the process of using magnetic force to remove metallic or ferrous materials from a mixture. Magnetic separation machines consist of a vibratory feeding mechanism, an upper and lower belt and a magnet. The bulk material is fed through the vibrating mechanism onto the lower belt. At this point, the magnet pulls any material.

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

## Magnetic separation
Magnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using a magnet to attract magnetic substances. The process that is used for magnetic separation separates non-magnetic substances from those which are magnetic. This technique is useful for the select few minerals which are ferromagnetic (iron-, nickel-, and cobalt-containing minerals) and paramagnetic.

After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, gravity concentration etc, gradually we can get iron from natural minerals (iron ore). It is the mineral aggregates that contain iron or iron compounds which can be used economically. Production Process of Iron Ore

Present Practice and State of Development. The largest development in the iron-ore industry, using magnetic concentration, is at the plants of Witherbee, Sherman & Co. at Mineville, N. Y., where about 1,200,000 tons of crude ore were mined and separated in 1916. The dry process of separation is used.

## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, & Extraction Methods
Sep 27, 2021The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

## Iron ore mining and dressing - tec-science
Ore processing (or ore dressing) is the separation of iron ore from gangue in order to optimize the blast furnace process! In principle, the undesirable gangue can never be completely separated from the iron ores during ore dressing. This means that a certain amount of unwanted elements always enters the blast furnace process.

## Iron Ore Pelletization - FEECO International Inc.
This process varies depending on the ore source, but typically involves various stages of crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the iron ore. Separation techniques such as magnetic separation or froth flotation are then used to separate the gangue materials from the iron content.

Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

## Separation process
A separation process is a method that converts a mixture or a solution of chemical substances into two or more distinct product mixtures, a scientific process of distinguishing two or more substance in order to obtain purity. At least one product mixture from the separation is enriched in one or more of the source mixture's constituents. In some cases, a separation may fully divide the mixture
