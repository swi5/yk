## Underground mining - block caving, bore hole, drift fill, hard rock
Retreat mining is a process that recovers the supporting coal pillars, working from the back of the mine towards the entrance, hence the word retreat.Room and pillar mining advances inward, away from the entrance of the mine. Other underground mining methods include Hard rock mining, bore hole mining, drift and fill mining, long hole slope

## Limestone extraction - underground mining techniques, drilling 
Limestone is a sedimentary rock comprising about 15% of the earth's sedimentary crust. Limestones are generally mined in the method of open pit mining and underground mining based on the economic and environmental conditions. Surface limestone mining. All over the world, the limestones are generally mined from a quarry or the open pit mining.

## Limestone in Virginia
Underground coal mines spray a slurry with limestone on their walls, to reduce methane emissions which could become explosive. The decline in underground coal mining, as natural gas became less expensive after fracking increased supply, led to a layoff at the Carmeuse Lime and Stone quarry outside of Strasburg.

## How do you recognize limestone and marble? - USGS
Marble forms when sedimentary limestone is heated and squeezed by natural rock-forming processes so that the grains recrystallize. If you look closely at a limestone, you can usually see fossil fragments (for example, bits of shell) held together by a calcite matrix. Limestone is more porous than marble, because there are small openings between

Limestone is a sedimentary rock mainly composed of calcium carbonate and calcite formed by marine organisms like coral, shellfish and algae. It holds up to 10% of the total volume of the sedimentary rocks. A pure limestone is white in color, however, with impurities like sand, minerals and clay, limestones are found in different colors too.

## JS&G Underground Mine #1.gov
JS&G Underground Mine #1, a limestone operation owned and operated by Joliet Sand & Gravel Company, was located in Joliet, Will County, Illinois.  Crushed limestone of minus 10-inch size was conveyed from the primary crusher underground to the surface by a series of conveyor belts. Sequentially, the material left the crusher on a short belt

## Ground Collapse: Old mines and prospects and sinkholes - NC
Building above an abandoned mine can be dangerous if the mine is weak or near the ground surface. On Feb. 18, 2000, a collapse hole developed in the front yard of a house in Cabarrus County (Figure 21). The hole was above the old Phoenix Gold Mine, which closed in 1906. In the 1980s a suburban golf course community was built over the mine.

## CDC - Mining - How Does Limestone Rock Dust Prevent Coal Dust 
Coal dust explosions in underground coal mines are prevented by generous application of rock dust (usually limestone). If an explosion should occur, the rock dust disperses, mixes with the coal dust and prevents flame propagation by acting as a thermal inhibitor or heat sink. To investigate this process in more detail, a number of explosion

## Limestone Mining Underground
Limestone Mining Underground. The underground mining is done when the ore is present in than 100m depth or when the availability of limestone is abundant. Other factors that determine underground mining is that topsoil covering the mineral is hard like rocks. The first process to start underground mining is considering the economical factors.

##  Limestone—A Crucial and Versatile Industrial Mineral Commodity - USGS
Some Issues in Limestone Mining. Limestone is most often mined from a quarry. However, underground limestone . mines are found at places in the central and eastern United States, especially in and near cities. Underground mining of lime - stone has some advantages over surface quarrying and will probably increase in the future.

Similar to underground mining, Surface mining also has a few upsides and downsides. The most common are: Most of the surface mines recover quickly. About 95 - 100% of mines recover after the mining is done. There are no obstacles to using machines. Miners have the freedom to operate heavy machines. Surface mining is cheaper than underground ming.
