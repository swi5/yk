## Copper extraction
All primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being chalcocite), are subjected to smelting.Some vat leach or pressure leach processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting leachate solution, but this is a minor part of the market.. Carbonate concentrates are a relatively minor product

## Copper Ore Hydrometallurgy and Pressure Leaching-Copper- - Metalcess
Copper hydrometallurgy is a branch of metallurgy method to extract copper directly from those difficult-to-concentrate copper oxide ore. Traditional copper hydrometallurgy process typically consists of atmospheric leaching, solvent extraction (SX) and electro-winning (EW). It can produce either copper cathode or copper sulphate crystal
