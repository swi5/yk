## Production of cobalt from copper-cobalt ores on the African Copperbelt 
Sep 1, 2020A specific cobalt flotation circuit is run at KCM's Nchanga concentrator. The ore from the Nchanga open pit contains pockets of ore with higher grades of cobalt, typically about 0.3% cobalt and 1.3% copper. This ore is processed in campaigns through the cobalt flotation circuit, which is illustrated schematically in Fig. 11. The concentrate
