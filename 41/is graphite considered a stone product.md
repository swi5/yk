## Ceramics - their properties, manufacture, and everyday uses
For example, graphite (a form, or allotrope, of carbon) is considered a ceramic because it's nonmetallic and inorganic, yet (unlike most ceramics) it's soft, wears easily, and is a good conductor of electricity. So if you looked only at the properties of graphite, you wouldn't consider it a ceramic at all.
