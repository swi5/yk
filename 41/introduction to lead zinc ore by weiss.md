lead and zinc are almost immiscible just above their melting points; silver is much more soluble in zinc than in lead; silver/zinc alloys have higher melting points than pure zinc. At 863 K zinc is removed by transferring the lead to a 'dezincing kettle'. At this stage the desilvered lead contains about 0.6% zinc and 0.0004% silver.

1. Introduction Some of most important sources of zinc ore are oxidized zinc minerals including, smithsonite (ZnCO 3), willemite (Zn 2 SiO 4), hydrozincite (2ZnCO 3.3Zn(OH) 2), zincite (ZnO) and hemimorphite (Zn 2 SiO 3.H 2 O). However, flotation of oxidized lead and zinc, in particular zinc minerals, is much more difficult than the flotation of corresponding sulphide minerals [1].

The chemical definition of a heavy metal is a chemical element with a specific gravity that is at least 5 times the specific gravity of water. Examples of heavy metals include cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, zinc and many more. Heavy metals are commonly used in industrial applications such as in the manufacture of pesticides.

Lead was the first metal mined in Australia at Glen Osmond in South Australia in 1841, after the wheel of a cart being pulled up a rough track accidentally exposed some lead-zinc ore. In 1876, lead-silver ore was discovered and mined at Thackaringa, near Broken Hill in New South Wales, but the mines closed in 1877.

## Zinc oxide
Ordinary white powdered zinc oxide can be produced in the laboratory by electrolyzing a solution of sodium bicarbonate with a zinc anode. Zinc hydroxide and hydrogen gas are produced. The zinc hydroxide upon heating decomposes to zinc oxide: Zn + 2 H 2 O → Zn (OH) 2 + H 2 Zn (OH) 2 → ZnO + H 2 O ZnO nanostructures [ edit]
