## How To Find Limestone - Realonomics
How can you identify limestone? Limestone is a very hard rock so try and crumble it in your hand or fingers. If it starts to come off in your hand then you don't have limestone. It is very possible that if you have limestone you have something that has fossil imprints in it. See if you can spot any areas where marine life might have been.

## Limestone, Shell, Dolomite - Florida Department of Environmental Protection
How is limestone, shell and dolomite mined in Florida? Mining begins with a land clearing operation in which the overburden (earthen material that will not be sold) is removed and stockpiled along the edge of the mine. The overburden may be used to contain sediment and stormwater within the mine.

## Characterization of limestone reacted with acid-mine drainage in a 
Armoring of limestone is a common cause of failure in limestone-based acid-mine drainage (AMD) treatment systems. Limestone is the least expensive material available for acid neutralization, but is not typically recommended for highly acidic, Fe-rich waters due to armoring with Fe(III) oxyhydroxide coatings.
