## How to Reduce Your Greenhouse Gas Emissions
This approach reduces greenhouse gas emissions and enhances the soil's capacity to sequester carbon. Also consider how much processing and packaging goes into the food you buy, and the distance traveled from farm to market. Generally speaking, foods with the fewest fossil-fuel inputs are the most climate-wise choice. 3) Reduce food waste.

Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) Nitrous oxide (N2O) Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)19. The U.K Government recommends that businesses start by measuring these six GHGs. Organizations should also identify the emissions their activity is most likely to emit, as different business activities will release different greenhouse gases.

Climate changes that occur as a result of global warming caused by increasing amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) released into the atmosphere are an alarming issue. Controlling greenhouse gas emissions is critically important for the current and future status of mining activities. The mining industry is one of the significant contributors of greenhouse gases.

Human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases - are a primary driver of climate change - and present one of the world's most pressing challenges. 1 This link between global temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations - especially CO 2 - has been true throughout Earth's history. 2. To set the scene, let's look at

## Reducing greenhouse gas emissions of engines in the oil and gas sector 
The oil and gas sector's environmental footprint differs between its upstream, midstream and downstream activities. For midstream, refineries collectively represent the majority of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in this stage of the processing. On the other hand, many different activities contribute to the sector's GHG emissions produced during upstream processing.
