Results From an early age, both patients had several lesions of the nervous system including progressive polyneuropathy, and multiple aggressive giant cell-rich lesions of the jaws and craniofacial/skull bones, and other skeletal lesions. One patient had a relatively milder disease phenotype possibly due to postzygotic somatic mosaicism.
