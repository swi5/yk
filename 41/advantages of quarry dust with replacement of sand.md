## Sand or gravel under concrete slabyrelax.shop
Concrete slabs can develop voids from a variety of reasons, ranging from sliding soil beneath the slab displaced because of a lack of proper compression, to water erosion slowly washing away the soil over time. Voids can lead to a weakness in the slab, causing dips in the surface, tilting or cracks and breaks.

## Strength Characteristics of Quarry Dust in Replacement of Sand
Abstract. The replacement of natural fine aggregate by using quarry dust leads to consumption of generated quarry dust, the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and solves the natural sand scarcity problem. The sand availability as a fine aggregate at low cost which needs the reason to search as a alternative material.

Remember that quarry dust is finer than sand, thus cannot be used as 100% replacement as it might lead to large particle size differences between coarse and fine particles.

## benefits of quarry dust
The machine''s screen traps the larger pieces of crushed stone, so only the smaller pieces .. E OF QUARRY DUST IN CONCRETE AS REPLACEMENT . · Quarry dust is an alternate material of sand which is use in construction work. Quarry dust is produced from crusher unit and each crusher unit is produced nearly 22% to 27% of dust.

## advantages of quarry dust with replacement of sand
The Quarry dust may be used in the place of river sand fully or partly.A comparatively good strength is expected when sand is replaced partially or fully with or without concrete admixtures.It is proposed to study the possibility of replacing sand with locally available crusher waste without sacrificing the strength and workability of concrete

## Strength and Workability Properties of Concrete Replaced by Quarry Dust 
The replacement of sand as a major ingredient of concrete by quarry dust will be a techno economic solution to the above problem .The present research work was carried out to study the strength and stability of concrete containing quarry dust and GGBS as partial replacement of sand and cement at various percentages .
