## Coal | Australia's Energy Commodity Resources 2021
During 2019, Australia had 96 operating black coal mines, 3 operating brown coal mines (Figure 5), and more than 200 known coal deposits. The majority of Australia's black coal mines are in Queensland and New South Wales, which accounted for approximately 50 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively, of Australia's coal production (Figure 6).

There have also been linked to mercury poisoning and developmental disorders in children. Another one of the environmental impacts of mining coal in Australia is the release of tailings damming sediment. Damming of this sediment occurs when the mining process is taking place, and these tailings dams can take a very long time to deteriorate.

## Coal in Australia
About 70% of coal mined in Australia is exported, mostly to eastern Asia, [2] and of the balance most is used in electricity generation. In Australia exported 390 Mt of coal (177 Mt metallurgical coal and 213 Mt thermal coal) and was the world's largest exporter of metallurgical coal and second largest exporter of thermal coal. [3]
