Particulate matter and gases evolve together during the steelmaking process and are conveyed into a gas cleaning system. Emissions are cleaned using a wet or dry system. The particulate matter removed as emissions in the dry system is referred to as EAF dust, or EAF sludge if it is from a wet system.

This new method is used in neutral or even physiological pH and ionic strength conditions, with a remarkable capability to remove impurities. The process is as rapid as current adsorption chromatography procedures usable for the removal of a large number of protein impurities, with each one present in small amounts, such as host cell proteins.

## A Short History of Steel and the Bessemer Process - ThoughtCo
Blister steel production advanced in the 1740s when English clockmaker Benjamin Huntsman found that the metal could be melted in clay crucibles and refined with a special flux to remove slag that the cementation process left behind. Huntsman was trying to develop a high-quality steel for his clock springs. The result was crucible—or cast—steel.

Steel mill with two arc furnaces. Steelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and/or scrap. In steelmaking, impurities such as nitrogen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur and excess carbon (the most important impurity) are removed from the sourced iron, and alloying elements such as manganese, nickel, chromium, carbon and vanadium are

## Steel making process - ArcelorMittal
There are two main processes for producing steel: by means of a blast furnace (= indirect reduction) in combination with a converter, or by means of an electric furnace. In the former process, iron ore is the main raw material. In an electric furnace, scrap iron is used and occasionally also sponge iron. Sponge is an intermediate product, which

## USB1 - Process for removing impurities from bauxite - Google
A process for producing alumina from bauxite is described in which bauxite is treated with an alkali to form a mixture comprising a solution of aluminum-containing ions and alumina trihydrate is precipitated from the solution. The process comprises treatment of the solution before or after the precipitation step with a layered double hydroxide in order to remove impurities from the solution by
