## Nigerian Mining Corporation Nmc Jos Plateau Nigeria
The Nigerian Mining Corporation NMC was formed in the early 1980s to explore for golds. Lack of fund, and the lure of easier profits from oil production led to its failure. There is no large scale gold mining operation in Nigeria today, though there is small-scale mining carried out by artists.
