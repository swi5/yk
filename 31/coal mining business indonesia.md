## Coal Mining Sector in Indonesia | GBG
A major concern for investors in Indonesia's mining sector is the changeable regulatory framework. Law No. 4/2009 on Mineral and Coal Mining and its implementing Government Regulations bring a host of new rules, some of which have been heavily resented in the industry. The divestment rule is of particular interest to foreign investors.

Coal mining is a difficult, dangerous job, rarely associated with good labour relations. But at one of the largest mines in Indonesia, natural resources are being exploited by a human resources director who puts people first. She enlisted the help of the International Labour Organization in training workers about their rights. As ILO TV now reports, the mine has seen output soar.

Coal is currently a major part of the Indonesian economy with coal mining contributing to about 5% of the country's GDP and 12% of all export income. However, the Indonesian coal economy is changing.

## In Indonesia, Sumatra's coal brings more harm than good
The coal curse affecting Sumatra's residents is a matter of unhealthy politics. The coal sector is strongly linked to national and regional oligarchs, and coal businesses often play a role as financiers for political candidates. This clientelism has helped boost concession permits in the coal business, from just 750 in 2001 to 10.900 at present.
