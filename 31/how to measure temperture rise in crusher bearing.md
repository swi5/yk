## How to Measure Bearings
To measure the bore of a bearing you can use a vernier caliper like the one shown. Insert the outer anvils of the caliper into the bore as shown and open the caliper until the bearing and caliper are a good fit about each other. Now read the value on the caliper. In the absence of a caliper a good quality steel ruler will suffice.
