## Is It Right To Use Crushed Stone Instead Of Sub Base
 Medium-sized crushed stone is ideal for creating a base layer on top of a sub-base layer of larger crushed stone. Medium stone settles into voids and provides a stable layer to support the surface, increasing the structural integrity of the foundation.

Type 3 Open Graded SHW Clause 805 Sub Base is a pure crushed stone, ranging in size from 40mm down to dust, but with a reduced (not zero) fines content. Available both as a granite or limestone, Type 3 Sub Base is widely used as a sub-base material for projects where a lower fine content is required for improved drainage.

## Do's and Don'ts of Paver Installation: Step 2 of 3 - Base  - Unilock
Use the correct bedding material. Avoid stone dust or limestone screenings, as these materials usually have too many fines (dust) that trap water that can cause early failure of the pavers. Sand is often used. Instead of sand, you can also use a small chip stone called "ASTM #9s," "HPB" or "clear 1/8″ chip."

Recycling crushed concrete to be reused helps reduce landfill crowding AND saves more resources from being used to create new concrete. Old concrete can be crushed down to specific sizes, cleaned so that unwanted debris is removed from the mixture, and reused as a solution to a number of construction and landscaping problems.

Best sub base for a driveway. The base has to be strong enough to support a heavy load, and porous enough to let water drain through. Concrete is an excellent sub base for driveways, but it's hard to maintain once it is installed. Fine grading of aggregate adds porosity and drainage but makes concrete more prone to cracking.

Once that area is blocked off, use a clean structural fill such as crushed stone or gravel. If you use stone, you can typically avoid compacting in place, as it is considered a self-compacting material. If you use gravel, you will need to compact in lifts of 8 to 12 inches. An alternative is to use a cementitious product such as flowable fill.

## What Kind of Base Should You Use for Patio Pavers Installation?
Open-graded base. An open-graded paver base uses 1/4″-10 crushed gravel or crushed stone as its support layers. This type of base is beneficial because it is porous and allows water to flow freely through. This helps prevent paver failure due to hydrostatic pressure (the force of water pushing against a surface).
