Barite is the mineralogical name for barium sulfate, which is also referred to as barytes. The most basic marketable product is known as "crude barite," which is barite that usually has undergone simple beneficiation methods, such as jigging, tabling and washing, or more complex methods, such as flotation, heavy-media separation and magnetic separation.

Barite is a mineral composed of barium sulfate (BaSO 4 ). It receives its name from the Greek word "barys" which means "heavy." This name is in response to barite's high specific gravity of 4.5, which is exceptional for a nonmetallic mineral. The high specific gravity of barite makes it suitable for a wide range of industrial, medical, and
