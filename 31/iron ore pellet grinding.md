## tilden - Michigan State University
Marquette County's Empire and Tilden mines together produce 20% of North America's iron ore. When the Empire and Tilden mines are producing concentrated iron ore pellets at full capacity, they produce (combined) nearly 16 million tons a year. Open-pit iron mining in the 21st century is an expensive proposition that uses explosives, computers

## Iron Ore Pelletization - FEECO International Inc.
Iron ore must go through a lengthy pre-processing stage before it can be pelletized - a series of steps that work to beneficiate and concentrate low-grade ores. This process varies depending on the ore source, but typically involves various stages of crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the iron ore.

## Development of a Novel Grinding Process to Iron Ore Pelletizing through 
The earliest industrial application of high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) at comminution was in 1984 in the cement industry. Since then, the equipment has been widely applied in mining activities. Despite the rapid spread across the industry, several challenges are still present in the equipment's application, especially considering the complex ore breakage behaviour reported for this process.

At this stage, by bonding between iron ore particles and other pellet load materials, the crystalline structure of the rock changes and reactions occur between slag-forming materials and iron oxides. In this first step, the materials are exchanged and neutral compounds or games are formed between the grains of iron oxides.

Concentrate/ground iron ore of typical size 80 % less than 45 microns (0.045 mm) with a moisture content of around 9 % is required for the pellet production. Suitable binder (normally bentonite) is added to the concentrate which is thoroughly mixed in high intensity mixer.
