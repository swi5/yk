## Nickel mining in Australia - history, top locations and companies - GRT
The rise in nickel mining is attributed to the Kambalda region in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia. Nickel ore grades in the 1960s had 4% nickel but within a decade the nickel ore grade in Australia fell to 2%. Over the last 20 years, low grade laterite or sulphide deposits have posted an average ore grade of about 1.2%.
