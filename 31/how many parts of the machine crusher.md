## Crushers: A Brief Guide to Crushers and Crushing Operations - Thomasnet
Essentially, there are four types of crushing operations: shearing, compression, abrasion, and impact. Shearing is a cutting action that cleaves a workpiece between the edges of two surfaces. Compression involves squeezing with a workpiece between two opposing surfaces with increasing pressure until it breaks.

## Choosing the right crusher - Buying Guides DirectIndustry
A crusher is a machine that uses mechanical energy to break blocks of stone, concrete, or other building materials into smaller blocks of a specific grain size. They are particularly used in the mining industry to reduce the size of ore blocks and facilitate their processing. Crushers are designed to receive blocks of a maximum size.

The walls of the gyratory crusher's hopper are lined with "V-shaped" pieces, the mantle and the concave, like a jaw crusher but shaped like a cone. The ore is discharged through the smaller bottom output hole of the cone. While the cone does not move, an interior crushing movement is created by a revolving shaft on a vertical rod.
