## processing of pyrite
The pyrite in which small amounts of gold occurs is of crystalline variety (primary pyrite). The characteristics of primary pyrite are a absence of porosity, an extreme brittleness, a resistance to oxidation, and the existence of gold possessing a weak susceptibility to magnetism (due to a fine coating of a iron compound).

## Ask The Experts - How do I recover gold in pyrite? - ICMJ
A: It's true that pyrite from gold mines will contain a small amount of gold. It is microscopic and is found inside the pyrite crystal. Miners who process gold ores will get free gold particles that can be melted into bars, but they also recover pyrite that has small amounts of gold within it. Often the majority of the gold is in the free

There're 4 extraction processes. #1 Roasting-Cyanidation Treatment

4 Extraction Processes for Gold-Pyrite Ore. 1. The Characteristics of Gold-Pyrite Ore. When determining the beneficiation process of gold-pyrite ore, it is necessary to understand the material composition of the ore and the symbiotic relationship of gold in the pyrite. In general, the mineral types of this ore are simple and the content of pyrite

## Pyrite Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
Pyrite and gold can easily be distinguished. Gold is very soft and will bend or dent with pin pressure.  Today most sulfur is obtained as a byproduct of oil and gas processing. Some sulfur continues to be produced from pyrite as a byproduct of gold production.  Pyrite and Coal Mining. Sulfur occurs in coal in three different forms: 1
