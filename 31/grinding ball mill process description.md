## Grinding Mills and Their Types - IspatGuru
Grinding mills are size reductions machines that often follow crushers in the processes where finer products are desired after crushing. Different grinding machines are usually named as mills, for example rod mills, ball mills, and attrition mills. Because of the name, verb milling is also been used as a synonym for grinding.

Ball Mill an overview ScienceDirect Topics. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1-1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20-40% water by weight.

## Ball Mill - SlideShare
Introduction Ball mill is an efficient tool for grinding many materials into fine powder. The ball mill is used to grind many kinds of row materials. There are two ways of grinding: the dry process and the wet process. It can be divided into tubular type and flowing type according to different forms of discharging material.

22 May, 2019. The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force.
