## Gravel Pits, Quarries, and Aggregate Crushing and Screening Plants 
In the case of most new gravel pits, an Act250 permit will likely be required and the AQCD will request that the permit include a condition requiring effective dust control. If your gravel pit or quarry will include drilling, sawing, blasting, or aggregate crushing operations then an air permit will likely be required.
