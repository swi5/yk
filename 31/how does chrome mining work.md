An important difference to Bitcoin mining, which benefits the Ethereum Miner, lies in the mining process itself: the proof-of-work from Ethereum - called ehash - requires more memory than Bitcoin's. This stood in the way of development of Ethereum-reducing ASICs for a long time, thus preventing centralization of mining.

## How Does Cryptocurrency Mining Work? (Dummies Guide) - Crypto Miner Tips
Cryptocurrency Mining is a process in which digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ravencoin, utilize computing power from miners to verify transactions across their respective networks. Without computing power voluntarily offered by miners to validate transactions, these networks would run slow and inevitably fail.

## Mining Pools and How They Work | CryptoCompare
Mining pools consist of a collection of miners who have pooled their resources together in-order to mine a cryptocurrency. As the mining difficulty of a cryptocurrency increases, so too does the computational power required to mine it. This increase in computational power can often be too expensive for a solo miner to handle as it could result in higher energy costs, or the requirement of more

## Chrome Mining Processes and Flowsheet | Mining Pedia
Jun 18, 2021Chromite is weak magnetic, so strong magnetic separation can be used. In the beneficiation of chromite ore, we can use a medium magnetic machine to remove the magnetite, and then use a strong magnetic machine to recover the chromite and separate the gangue minerals.
