Mar 18, .3.18. A lathe is a machine that helps in shaping up different materials and performing various operations such as: turning, facing, thread cutting, taper turning, knurling, parting off and more. For any machining operation the workpiece should be held firmly and centered. The devices used for this purpose are chuck and late dead center.

## What is facing and turning operation? - Short-Question
What is the difference between turning and facing operations in lathe machine? In the turning operation, the tool generally reduces the diameter of the cylindrical workpiece, which can be done by cutting into the part for some depth and move the tool parallel to the axis of the part. While facing operation reduces the length of the piece, the

##  Lathe Operations - Hnsa
a. General . The lathe is a machine tool used principally for shaping articles of metal, wood, or other material. All lathes, except the vertical turret type, have one thing in common for all usual machining operations; the workpiece is held and rotated around a horizontal axis while being formed to size and shape by a cutting tool.

## What are the different types of Machining Operations?
Turning Operation. Turning is a type of machining operation used to remove material from the outer diameter of a cylindrical workpiece. The workpiece is held in a chuck rotating at high speed during turning operation. A single-point cutting tool is fixed to the machine, and it moves in X and Y directions to cut the material.

## What is Facing Operation & Difference Between Facing, Turning and 
Jan 27, 2021Facing is a machining operation that can be performed on a lathe or a milling machine. Facing on the milling machine is primarily face milling, while facing on the lathe is commonly used in turning and boring operations. Facing operation is one of the primary ways we can do on the lathe machine when we want to get any shape on a particular part.
