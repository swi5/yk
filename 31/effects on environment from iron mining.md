## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Impacts of strip mining: Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.

Mining Contributes To Global Warming. Natural resources extracted through mining contribute heavily to global warming. Coal and oil are burned to power cars and our electric grid, releasing dangerous CO2 into the environment. Beyond being fueling these processes, mining itself creates a lot of pollution.
