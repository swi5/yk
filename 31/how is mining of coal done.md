## Strip Mining - CITIZENS COAL COUNCIL
Strip mining is a type of surface mining where the overlying vegetation, rock, and soil (overburden) is removed in order to reach the underlying coal seam, which usually lies a few feet beneath the surface. Explosives are used to fracture any overlying rock, and then heavy machinery is used to remove the overburden and dump it into a nearby

One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.

Uses of Coal. It is mainly used to generate heat and electricity. It is used in households and in industries to accomplish various tasks. It is the cheapest source of power fuel. The iron and steel industry depends heavily on fossil fuel for energy. It is also used to produce useful products such as coke, tar, and coal gas.

Before the Industrial Revolution, two types of mines existed: drift mines and bell pits. Both were small-scale coal mines and the coal which came from these type of pits was used locally in homes and local industry. However, as the country started to industrialise itself, more and more coal was needed to fuel steam engines and furnaces.

When finished, miners practice "retreat" mining, extracting as much coal as possible from the remaining pillars as they
