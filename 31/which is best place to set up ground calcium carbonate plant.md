## Calcium Carbonate (activated & Precipitated) - Manufacturing Plant 
The most common arrangement for both precipitated and ground calcium carbonates is the hexagonal form known as calcite. Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), a manufactured form of calcium carbonate, is made by first hydrating high-calcium quicklime, and then reacting the resulting slurry or "milk-of lime" with carbon dioxide.

## Ground Calcium Carbonate Manufacturing Process
Ground calcium carbonate (GCC) is mechanically crushed and classified, and its particles are mostly in irregular shapes such as cubes, polygons and cuboids. According to its original particle size, it is divided into coarse ground calcium carbonate (>3 Âµm), fine ground calcium carbonate (1-3 Âµm) and ultra fine ground calcium carbonate (0.5-1
