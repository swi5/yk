## Atterberg Limit - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
2.4.1 Basic Definitions. The Atterberg limits consist of the following key values of moisture content: The Liquid Limit (LL) is the moisture content at which a fine-grained soil no longer flows like a liquid. The Plastic Limit (PL) is the moisture content at which a fine-grained soil can no longer be remolded without cracking.

The Atterberg limits test is a classification test and is performed to aid in the classification of soil and its plasticity characteristics.

The water content at which the soils change from one state to the other is known as consistency limits or Atterberg limit. The liquid state is the state of a fine-grained soil at which the soil will flow on its own weight. The plastic state is the condition at which the soil can be remolded to any shape without any development or cracks.

## Atterberg limits
The Atterberg limits are a basic measure of the critical water contents of a fine-grained soil: its shrinkage limit, plastic limit, and liquid limit.. Depending on its water content, a soil may appear in one of four states: solid, semi-solid, plastic and liquid.In each state, the consistency and behavior of a soil is different and consequently so are its engineering properties.

## What Are Atterberg Limits Test? - HPD CONSULT
The shrinkage limit is the point at which the soil changes from a rubber like material to a viscous liquid. â¢ The swelling of clay is defined as the amount of water it takes to make the soil's volume swell. The Atterberg limits can be used to differentiate between silt and clay, as well as distinct types of silts and clays.

## Atterberg Limits - Simply Explained - Structural Guide
Why Atterberg Limits Tests are Important. Soil states (solid, semi-solid, plastic and liquid) have significant differences in strength, consistency and behavior. Therefore, knowing the boundaries are very important. Classification of soil can be done using these data/ limits. Limits can be used to distinguish between silt and clay.
