## DC Machine : Construction, Working & Its Applications
So, these machines are used at a place where there is a requirement of single directional power. These machines are used in batteries to generate unidirectional power. This article gives an overview of a DC machine, which includes construction, working, parts, EMF equation, types, its losses, and applications.

Aug 13, 2021Here is the schematic diagram of a DC Generator. A DC generator consists of six main parts, which are as follows. Yoke. The outer frame of a DC generator is a hollow cylinder made up of cast steel or rolled steel is known as yoke. The yoke serves following two purposes. It supports the field pole core and acts as a protecting cover to the machine.

## Construction of DC Machine (Generator & Motor)
The dc generators and dc motors have the same general construction. In fact, when the machine is being assembled, the workmen usually do not know whether it is a dc generator or motor.

## DC Motor - Definition, Working, Types, and FAQs - BYJUS
A DC motor is defined as a class of electrical motors that convert direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy. From the above definition, we can conclude that any electric motor that is operated using direct current or DC is called a DC motor. We will understand the DC motor construction and how a DC motor converts the supplied DC

## Studying DC Machine characteristics using MATLAB - Skill-Lync
Basic Construction of DC Machine. The rotating electrical or DC machine has mainly two parts; one is Stator, and another one is Rotar. The stator and rotor are separated from each other by an air gap. The stator is the outer frame of the machine and is immovable. The rotor is free to move and is the inner part of the machine.
