## The Ins and Outs of Nital Etching | Indiana Precision Grinding
Machining and grinding are heat-intensive processes, so if an area of the component isn't properly cooled during the process, it will overheat or even burn, damaging the steel's properties and structural integrity.  For example, etching 0.8% carbon steel should be done with 2% nitric in alcohol for 10 to 15 seconds. A sample of aluminum

## carbon steel tools and Carbide tools on CBN wheels
Apr 10, 2018. #2. Well, I have touched up some carbide on my CBN wheels, but it is slow going. Can't remember any difference in wheel performance after. Any 'hardened' steel is fine on the CBN wheels, so axe heads, shovel blades, bench chisels, etc. The lawn mower blade is a softer metal and will clog the wheel up.

## gold processing - Mining and concentrating | Britannica
Gold can be freed from these ores or concentrates by treating them with various oxidizing processes. The most common method is to roast gold-bearing minerals at temperatures of 450Â° to 750Â° C (840Â° to 1,380Â° F) to destroy the interfering sulfides. Oxidation can also be accomplished by the use of high-pressure reactors called autoclaves, in

grinding carbon to get the gold out. The gold laden pregnant solution drains out from the bottom is typically done with large grinding mills that consume roughly one horsepower per ton per day of capacity. and strip the carbon of gold. Gold is then removed from the solution by electrowinning. Stripped carbon is returned to adsorption for reuse.
