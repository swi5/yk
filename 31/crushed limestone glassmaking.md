## How Glass is Made — SGS
It is made by using lead oxide instead of limestone, and potassium carbonate (potash) instead of the sodium carbonate (soda ash). Lead Oxide. There are many other types of specialty glass formulae, using ingredients other than lead or lime. One well-known example is borosilicate glass - which we know as "oven glass" or "Corning Ware.".

Glassmaking requires a carefully weighed selection of raw materials. For laboratory melting, a batch is prepared from reagent-grade chemicals such as floated silica, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, alumina, and borax—all of which are assumed to convert to equivalent amounts of oxides after decomposition. The mixed batch is placed in a covered crucible and heated generally inside an
