In 1775 Lord Ward of Dudley built a canal to link his colliery at nearby Tipton to the Birmingham Canal.Then three years later he built a 227 yard underground canal into his limestone mines here deep under Castle Hill.  If you would like to explore the limestone caverns from inside then a canal boat trip into the mines is highly recommended.

## Is limestone used in coal mines? - Origin of coal
Why is limestone scattered around a coal mine? Limestone powder, known as rock dust, is spread throughout the mine workings on a regular basis. .. When explosions do occur, the dispersed limestone powder absorbs the heat generated from the explosion and will either stop the chain reaction or reduce the intensity of the explosion.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

Some Issues in Limestone Mining. Limestone is most often mined from a quarry. However, underground limestone . mines are found at places in the central and eastern United States, especially in and near cities. Underground mining of lime - stone has some advantages over surface quarrying and will probably increase in the future.
