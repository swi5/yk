## Environmental Geochemistry of Igarra Marble Mining District 
The determination of the impacts of marble mining on the environment in Igarra was carried out via the analysis of soil and water samples as geological medium. Seven soil samples, ten water samples and five rock samples were collected. The samples collected were subjected to petro-graphic and geochemical analysis. The mean concentration of metals in soil from Ekpeshi were Cd (3.254 mg/kg), Co

## The incredible marble extraction process - Stone and Style
September 13, 2013 Marble deposits can be exploited in open pits, it can be 95% on outdoor quarries and 5% in caves or mines. Marble is located at ground level or at great depths which make the cost too high for removal. Formerly, the extraction of this stone was done manually with wooden wedges, halters, ropes, picks and shovels.

## How Does Marble Get Mined From a Quarry? - RIOSTONES
Mining marble blocks from the wall of the quarry starts with a "bench wall." The bench wall is a large section of marble along a vertical wall that is cut with diamond cables, drills, and torches. Dynamite loosens the bench wall from the side of the quarry, and the separated wall can then be processed and cut into individual, uniform blocks.
