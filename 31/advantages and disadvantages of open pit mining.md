## Everything You Need To Know About Open Pit Mining - Positive Points
One of the biggest benefits open pit mining produces is the growth in the overall efficiency when compared to deep-shaft mining methods. Mining occurs on the surface, so there aren't any space restrictions arising from narrow tunnels and shafts. Thus, the extraction rate is unaffected producing more ore at a faster rate.
