Chemically and physically, fly ash can have many forms depending upon the type of fuel burned and handling methods. The typical fly ash contains a significant amount of silicon dioxide and calcium oxide, which make it frictional and abrasive. Usually, fly ash has a fine particle size distribution with most less than 100 microns.
