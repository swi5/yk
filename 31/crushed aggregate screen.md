## Crushed Stone vs Crushed Gravel, What Are the Differences - Delta Aggregate
Crushed gravel may look similar to crushed stone and fall into the same bracket of material, but the key difference between the two is that crushed gravel is not made by man. Crushed gravel comes in the same form that it's found, there are no additives or other stones mixed in. And due to its organic nature, unlike crushed stone, you won't

## Maximizing Your Screening Efficiency | Aggregates Equipment Inc.
Screening efficiency measures how much of the desired aggregate is accurately separated during the screening process. For example, if your screens are operating at 80% efficiency, that means 80% of the desired aggregate size passes through the screens while 20% does not. Efficiency should be as close to 100% as possible, but keep in mind that
