## Oregon Beach Placers. Gold Prospecting at the Oregon Coast
Oregon Beach Placers. One of the more interesting concentrations of placer gold can be found along the southern coast of Oregon, where very fine particles of gold and platinum can be found amongst in the beach sands. These gold deposits were first discovered in 1852, not long after the discovery of a very significant gold district in Southwest

Mining is a skill that allows players to obtain ores and gems from rocks. The higher a player's Mining level is the more likely they are to successfully extract ore. With ores, a player can then either smelt bars and make equipment using the Smithing skill or sell them for profit. Mining is one of the most popular skills in RuneScape as many players try to earn a profit from the skill.
