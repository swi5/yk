## Gold CIL & CIP Gold Leaching Process Explained CCD
Cyanide is a lixiviant, or reagent that is used to leach, often in tanks, gold from a solid matrix and form a gold cyanide complex. The gold cyanide complex is then extracted from the pulp or slurry by adsorption onto activated carbon. CIL stands for carbon-in-leach. This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to

## In cyanide process zinc is used as?s
What is cyanide leaching give an example? Cyanide leaching has been the industry standard for gold processing for more than 100 years. During the cyanide leach process, a cyanide solution, or lixiviant, is percolated through ore contained in vats, columns or heaps. Gold is dissolved by the cyanide and then removed from the heap or columns.

## Gold Heap Leaching Process Technical Requirements
01 Granulation. To make the gold heap leaching process successful, the heap leaching material must have good permeability so that the cyanide solution can evenly pass through the ore pile. Most ores need to be crushed to 25.4mm or finer before granulation in order to expose the gold contained in the ore and improve the gold recovery rate.
