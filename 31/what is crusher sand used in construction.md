## Can Sea Sand be Used for Concrete Construction?
Concrete is a mixture of cement, coarse aggregates, fine aggregates or sand and water. Among them, natural river sand is the main source of fine aggregate or sand. However, with the exhaustion of river sand resources and restricted mining, the contradiction between the supply and demand of construction sand has become more and more intense.
