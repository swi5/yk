## The future of coal in South Africa - Technology for Mining
The South African government has a plan for energy projection up to 2030. The hope is that an additional generating capacity of 9.5 GW of wind, 6.8 GW of solar, 6.7 GW of coal, and 2.5 GW of hydropower will be available by that time. This would still mean that South Africa would still be acquiring 64% of its power from coal.

After a coal mine is abandoned, it often leaches highly acidic water, which then flows into surrounding ecosystems. To date, more than 6,000 mines have been abandoned in South Africa, with damages from acidic water requiring an estimated 30 billion rand ($2.67 billion) in clean-up costs nationwide, according to a WWF report.
