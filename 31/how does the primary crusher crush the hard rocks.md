## Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A. Gupta, D.S. Yan, in Mineral Processing Design and Operation, 2006 6.1.3 Roll Crusher Circuit Design. Roll crushers are generally not used as primary crushers for hard ores. Even for softer ores, like chalcocite and chalcopyrite they have been used as secondary crushers. Choke feeding is not advisable as it tends to produce particles of irregular size.

First, break the hard rock. Then use your fingernail (Mohr's Scale 2), copper keys (Mohr's Scale 3) and a small knife (Mohr's Scale 5.5) to scratch the cutting section of the hard rock. If your nail has the notch, the rock is harder than the nail. If the key has the notch, the rock hardness is larger.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
