## how does the primary crusher crush the hard rocks
Primary Crushing Mineral Processing & Metallurgy. Characteristics of Rocks to Crush. Characteristics of the material to be crushed include the geological classification of the rock, its physical structure, its chemical analysis (at least so far as abrasive constituents are concerned), and at least a qualitative evaluation of its resistance to crushing that is, whether soft, medium, hard, or

## Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A. Gupta, D.S. Yan, in Mineral Processing Design and Operation, 2006 6.1.3 Roll Crusher Circuit Design. Roll crushers are generally not used as primary crushers for hard ores. Even for softer ores, like chalcocite and chalcopyrite they have been used as secondary crushers. Choke feeding is not advisable as it tends to produce particles of irregular size.

First, break the hard rock. Then use your fingernail (Mohr's Scale 2), copper keys (Mohr's Scale 3) and a small knife (Mohr's Scale 5.5) to scratch the cutting section of the hard rock. If your nail has the notch, the rock is harder than the nail. If the key has the notch, the rock hardness is larger.

Often times the secondary crusher is not used and the primary crusher conveys into a screening plant which separates the material into 3 products. Not all jaw crushers are designed to handle hard rock though. In fact, most of the smaller jaw crushers on the market are only designed to crush concrete, block, and brick and not hard rock.
