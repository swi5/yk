## Froth Flotation of Iron Ores.au
the most popular flotation route in iron ore industry, the direct flotation of iron ox ides still appears desirable for some low grade iron ores that contain a vast amount of quartz. For example, at Republic Mine, Michigan, U.S.A., a hematite ore is upgraded from 36.5% Fe to 65.4% Fe with a Fe recovery of 82.5% using the direct flotation route.

## Reverse Flotation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In reverse flotation of silica from iron ores using an anionic collector, Ca ions are introduced to adsorb on the silica and alter the surface charge to positive, thus enabling collector adsorption through the electrostatic mechanism (Houot, 1983).

Due to gradual depletion of high-grade iron ores, there is a need to investigate the treatment of low-grade iron ores. Current procedures are time and cost intensive. Batch laboratory scale reverse cationic flotation was employed to concentrate low-grade Fe ore, found in fluorspar tails in the form of hematite. This study used two types of depressants (soluble starch and dextrin) and two types

## Iron Ore Reverse Flotation Process
What Are The Common Iron Processing Methods Mining. Hematite is easier to floated than magnetic, which could be separated by positive flotation. as the density of iron ore is much higher than that of gangue mineral, gangue mineral is more likely to attach to the foam than iron ore. therefore, for iron ore, reverse flotation is more advantageous than positive flotation. when the magnetite content.

## Optimal Control of Iron Ore Flotation with Soft Sensors for Grade and 
For Brazilian iron ore producers, reverse cationic flotation is preferred to obtain high quality concentrates from silicate ores. The SiO2 (silica) particles are rendered hydrophobic by amine (cationic collector) in alkaline conditions, while iron is depressed by the addition of starch.

pH values in levels usually applied in the reverse flotation of iron ore, i.e. between 8.9 and 11.0. The results presented in Figure 6 show that the rise in pH led to a significant rise in the recovery of Fe in the concentrate. The content of SiO 2 diminished for pH values up to 10.5 and the Fe content remained practically stable throughout the range studied.

## Magnesite (magnesium) Flotation Process
The following two methods is the designed magnesite (magnesium) flotation process by us. High grade magnesite (magnesium) ore flotation process: the grinding fine ore will feed into agitation tank, and meshed with flotation reagent. Reverse flotation will get the concentrate ore pulp. Then pulp will transport into thickener and reduce the water.
