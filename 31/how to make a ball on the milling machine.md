CNC.Per Magnusson.The spindle on my Taig CNC mill was getting uncomfortably hot after a few minutes of milling; especially at higher RPMs.It ran smoothly and without any play, but with noticeable friction, so I decided to try to change the ball bearings. The only remaining change to make is to replace the Taig pulleys with two-step pulleys.
