## FAQ: How To Calculate Compressive Strength Of Concrete Cylinder?
For normal concrete and HSC, the concrete compressive strength test results from cube specimens are generally higher than cylinders specimens [6]. As states in BS 1881, the compressive strength of concrete gained by cylinder specimens is equal to 0.8 times of the compressive strength gained by cube specimens.

When microscopic microbuckling occurs, the compressive strength of the fiber, σ fc, is of the order G/4, where G is the longitudinal shear modulus of the fiber (deTeresa et al., 1988; Kumar et al., 1988

## Factors Governing concrete mix design - Civil Knowledges
Grading of Combined Aggregate. The relative proportions of the fine and coarse aggregates in a concrete mix are one of the important factors affecting the strength of concrete. For dense concrete, it essential that the coarse and fine aggregate be well graded. Generally, the locally available aggregate does not conform to the standard gradings.
