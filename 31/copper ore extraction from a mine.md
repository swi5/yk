## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## How Is Copper Extracted - Realonomics
How is copper extracted and from which minerals? Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels called adits to reach the ore.

Surface mines are created for mineral deposits that are near the surface underground mines are blasted into rock to get at deeper deposits. Ore is extracted from rock by heap leaching flotation or smelting. How ore minerals are extracted? The mining process involves the excavation of large amounts of waste rock to remove the desired mineral ore.

Copper ores are a mixture of some primary sulfate, oxide, phosphate, and copper carbonate minerals and some amount of secondary sulfide minerals, such as dominantly chalcocite but digenite which is important in these deposits. An important copper ore mine was discovered in the 1970s, in Recsk, Northern Hungary city.

The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining, concentrating, smelting, and refining. In a few instances, however, leaching takes the place of concentrating, smelting, and refining. At present, although considerable leaching and direct-smelting ores are produced, the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.
