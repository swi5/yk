## How to Use Soil Amendments to Neutralize pH Video | DoMyOwn
If your soil is above a 7, it is considered basic or alkaline and you'll need to use sulfur or a soil acidifier or gypsum to lower that pH. Doing that is gonna be more common for the Northern states rather than the Southern states. Southern states tend to have a little more acid into the clay and that kind of thing.

Different plants respond differently to salinity, with some being highly tolerant and others incapable of thriving in too-salty soil. The primary way to address soil with a high saline content is by leaching, which means to wash a low-salt solution through the soil so that the saline content is flushed out.
