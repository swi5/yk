## Aggregate Size In Concrete | Coarse Vs Fine Aggregate - Union Quarries
Coarse aggregate is any material whose particles are anywhere from 3/8 inches and 1.5 inches in width. This is the size of aggregate often used in road construction. Fine aggregate: Most fine aggregates consist of crushed stone or natural sand. Most of the present particles must be able to pass through a 3/8-inch sieve.

## Limestone Vs. Crushed Concrete | eHow
Limestone vs. Crushed Concrete. In its pure form, limestone differs significantly from crushed concrete in that the former constitutes a naturally formed rock found in marine environments and the other a manmade construction material. Limestone may appear in crushed concrete as a material found in the cement used to mix concrete.

## Using Recycled Concrete Aggregate in New Concrete Pavement Mixes
In the 1980s, MnDOT and other state transportation agencies began using such recycled aggregate in the concrete course as well. But this latter practice was discontinued by the early 1990s due to mid-slab cracking observed in pavements constructed with such concrete. Using recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) in the base course has continued, however.

Unstabilized, loose crushed concrete has all the downsides that loose gravel does. It spreads and thins easily, requiring you to add more and to constantly even out your driveway so it doesn't develop bare spots and ruts. Crushed concrete also creates dust rather easily, which can stick to your vehicles and dirty them.

## Recycled Aggregates - Cement
The concrete itself becomes aggregate and any embedded metals can be removed and recycled as well. As space for landfills becomes premium, this not only helps reduce the need for landfills, but also reduces the economic impact of the project. Moreover, using recycled concrete aggregates reduces the need for virgin aggregates.

The drainage aggregate called Scoria is a type of igneous rock formed under pressure during the formation of volcanic cones. It is therefore extremely hard and durable yet very porous, so it drains water from surface soils extremely well.

Practical information . Optimum grain shape, crushed/round: Cubic/spherical shapes have proved more suitable than linear forms, which can affect the consistence.Crushed aggregate has a slightly higher water requirement for the same consistence because of its larger specific surface area, but higher concrete compressive and particularly tensile strengths can be obtained due to better interlocking.

Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. After harvesting, aggregate is processed: crushed, screened, and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.
