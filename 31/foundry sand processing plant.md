## Adjusting Sand Classifiers to Reduce Fines | Foundry Management 
Removing sand fines through the classifier depends on several process details, namely 1) dwell time; 2) fluidizing air volume; and 3) exhaust negative pressure in the head space. Dwell time — The sand in a fluid-bed system resembles any liquid in a vessel. The faster that fluid is poured into the vessel, the faster the fluid will overflow.

Foundry sand is clean, uniformly sized, high quality silica sand, used in foundry casting processes. The sand is bonded to form molds or patterns used for ferrous (iron and steel) and non-ferrous (copper, aluminum, brass) metal castings. Shake-out sand from completed metal casting are often reclaimed back into the foundry sand process.
