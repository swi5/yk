## mica | Structure, Properties, Occurrence, & Facts | Britannica
mica, any of a group of hydrous potassium, aluminum silicate minerals. It is a type of phyllosilicate, exhibiting a two-dimensional sheet or layer structure. Among the principal rock-forming minerals, micas are found in all three major rock varieties—igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Of the 28 known species of the mica group, only 6 are common rock-forming minerals. Muscovite, the

Minerals. Minerals are solid substances that have formed naturally in the Earth. They have a characteristic chemical and physical properties and usually a regular crystal structure.  Mica is the mineral responsible for putting a sparkle on many rocks. This mineral is very flexible, and large sheets of it were used as window glass in the past
