How the Cylindrical Grinding Process Works. During the cylindrical grinding process, the machinist sets the piece of metal between two centers, called head and tail stocks. When the machinist operates the machine, the cylinder rotates in one direction. Then, the grinding wheel moves in the opposite direction at a different speed to start grinding.
