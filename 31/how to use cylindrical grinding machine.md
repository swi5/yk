## Cylindrical Grinder Safety
For example, when using a cylindrical grinder you should wear protective goggles and protective gloves. Additionally there should be a guard in front of the grinding wheel which will offer extra protection from any objects which may fly off from the wheel. Knowing how to use a machine can make you work more effectively but it can also be dangerous.

How the Cylindrical Grinding Process Works. During the cylindrical grinding process, the machinist sets the piece of metal between two centers, called head and tail stocks. When the machinist operates the machine, the cylinder rotates in one direction. Then, the grinding wheel moves in the opposite direction at a different speed to start grinding.
