## Common Uses For Limestone | What Can Lime Be Used For?
Applying pulverized limestone increases bacterial activity in the soil, which creates a more favorable soil structure. It helps with the disintegration of organic matter and compost. This in turn makes the soil more porous, which increases the air's ability to circulate through the soil and hold and absorb water.

Limestone is the raw material used to manufacture cement. Limestone is mainly mined at Athi River near Nairobi and at Bamburi near Mombasa. The limestone along the Coast extends to Mombasa Island and is mainly formed from remains of corals. Limestone rocks are dug up in large masses using open cast method and crushed using large mechanical rollers.

## how limestone is mined
Limestone is now mined using surface and underground methods. Surface quarrying is the most common method of producing limestone in Missouri. Also, it is typically the most economical method. Many surface operations are simply hillside cuts or open pit quarries. Controlled blasting at the quarry face is used to break the rock into pieces.

## Where Can Limestone Be Found - Realonomics
The most common place to find limestone is beneath the marine waters. Ocean conditions form the rock as organisms animal skeletons and calcium carbonate combine. The shells and other items build up over time and harden into a limestone deposit on a larger scale. Where is limestone found and mined? Limestone is most often mined from a quarry
