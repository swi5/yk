## What is a Cone Crusher| Advantages, Types, Parts and Specifications 
The cone crusher is mainly used for secondary crushing and tertiary crushing in aggregate crushing of mines and quarries. Because of its strong crushing capacity and large output, it is more used for the crushing of medium-hard materials. The cutting-edge crusher technology has higher crushing efficiency and more convenient operation.

## A Detailed Overview of Cone Crushers and What You Need to Know
Some cone crushers use bushings while others use bearings. Bearing cone crushers tend to run cooler and are more efficient than bushing crushers, and they allow the user to apply more horsepower during crushing without generating excessive heat. Bushing cones create more heat and require lots of lubricating oil and more active cooling systems.
