## Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) Sets - Mechanical and Physical 
The Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) Test Set provides a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. Each set consists of steel cylinder, plunger, base plate, cylindrical measure and tamping rod. All parts of the apparatus are powder coated or galvanized steel, heat treated and ground

So this aggregate was not strong. 4 CONCLUSION. The ACV value is more than 45% for aggregate used for concrete for non- wearing surface and less than 25% for wearing surface like runways and roadways. The higher the aggregate crushing value, the lower the resistance to crushing under the gradually applied compressive load. 5 REFERENCES

Aggregate Crushing value is a measure of the strength of the aggregate. The strength of concrete largely depends upon the strength of aggregate. The aggregate should therefore have minimum crushing value. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under gradually applied crushing load.

## AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE (IS:2386-Part 4-1963)
Aggregate crushing Value =(W B /W A) × 100 Record. The mean of the two results is reported to the nearest whole number as the aggregate crushing value of the tested material. Safety & Precautions: Use hand gloves while removing containers from oven after switching off the oven. To wear safety shoes & helmet during the time of test.

## Aggregate Crushing Value and 10% Fines Value.pdf - Chapter
Calculate the Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV)expressed as a percentage to the first decimal place, of the mass of fines formed to the total mass of the test specimen from the following expression. (ACV) = 100 x M2 / M1 Where, M1 is the mass of the test specimen in grammes. M2 is the mass of the material passing the 2.36mm test sieve in grammes.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test | Crushing Value of Aggregate - Civiconcepts
The aggregate Crushing Value Test is an important test to be performed on aggregate.The strength of aggregate parent rock is determined by preparing cylindrical shape specimens of size 25 mm in diameter and 25 mm in height.. This cylinder is subjected to compressive stress.Depending on the type of parent rock gives the different crushing values of aggregate as a compressive strength varying
