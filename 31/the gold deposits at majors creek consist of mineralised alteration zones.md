the factors that cause the alteration complications and variations in orogenic gold system mainly include: (1) orogenic gold deposits form in much more varied crustal depths relative to other gold deposits ( groves et al., 1998; wang et al., 2021 ); (2) the disseminated and quartz-vein orogenic gold systems formed under different fluid/rock .

Mesozonal orogenic gold was precipitated from low-salinity fluids at depths of six to twelve kilometre sand at temperatures between 300°C and 475°C. The main phase of mesozonal orogenic mineralisation in the Bendigo and Stawell zones occurred at around 440 million years ago (440 Ma) and that in the Melbourne Zone at around 380 Ma.

##  Thick Gold Mineralised Zones at Butchers Creek
alteration haloes containing pyrite > pyrrhotite >> arsenopyrite. The best mineralised intercepts exhibit strong albite alteration and abundant sulphides. In addition, recent petrological investigation clearly shows the gold is related to the sulphides present in the syenite with gold occurring dominantly as inclusions within pyrite and pyrrhotite.

Mineralized Veins and Breccias of the Cripple Creek CiteSeerX. The Cripple Creek district has yielded nearly 21 million troy ounces of gold since its discovery The major veins exhibit remarkable vertical continuity extending There is no expansion of the alteration zones in the upper level mine The bulk tonnage deposits as exemplified by the Globe Hill area consist of mineralized

## Major's Creek, N.S.W., Australia — A Devonian epithermal gold deposit
Mineralized veins at Major's Creek consist of preponderant quartz and carbonate gangue with gold, Au-Ag tellurides and base metal sulphides within silicified and sericitized dykes or granodiorite of the Braidwood Granite. Fluid inclusion studies indicate deposition throughout the range 350-80°C by low salinity fluids. Significant Au-Ag telluride mineralization took place at a temperature of
