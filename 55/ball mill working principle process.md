## Working Principle of Bead mill
Bead Mill - Working Principle. The bead mill consists of a horizontal grinding chamber, which in turn houses the shaft and agitator discs. The chamber is filled with zirconium grinding media and the material leakage is prevented by the double acting mechanical seal. The material is pumped into the chamber using a air operated diaphragm pump or

The cylinder can be made of metal, porcelain, or rubber. Inside the cylinder balls or pebbles are placed. The balls occupy between 30 and 50% of the volume of the cylinder. The diameter of the balls depends on

## Ball Mill - Principle, Construction, Working, and More
Principle of Ball Mill: The size reduction in the ball mill is a result of fragmentation mechanisms (impact and attrition) as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. Mixing of feed is achieved by the high energy impact of balls. The energy levels of balls are as high as 12 times the gravitational acceleration.

The working ball charge in the mill will be as shown in Table 12. Working Ball Charge in Ball Mill. Suppose that once every week the mills are stopped and all balls less than 2 in. in diameter are removed. If the ball wear is 2 lb. per ton of ore crushed, this will amount to 720 lb.
