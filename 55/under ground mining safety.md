Coal mining deep underground involves a higher safety risk than coal mined in opencast pits, due primarily to problems associated with mine ventilation and the potential for mine collapse. However, there are safety risks associated with all forms of coal mining, not least because of the heavy machinery utilized in coal excavation.

## Mining Safety: What You Need to Know
Mines should also employ visual safety tools such as safety signs and labels to increase safety awareness and keep operations in the workplace running smoothly. The visuals you post in your mine will depend in part on the type of mine you operate—metal, nonmetal, coal, underground, surface—but there are many basic safety signs you should post.

Underground mining operations around the world pose similar risks to worker safety and health. Though different techniques are used to extract base metals, precious metals, nonmetallic minerals, diamonds and coal, the hazards do not differ that much. The deeper the mine, however, the greater the risk. Safety Challenges in Underground Mines

## What is Underground mining and How it works | 2021 Updated (2022)
This article will give you a general idea of underground mining and its different methods. Open-pit mining or surface mining is one of the most common mining methods used on the earth's surface. This type of mining starts from the surface of the planet. On the other hand, Underground mining is only to extract ore from below the earth's surface.

## Mine safety
Safety has long been a concern in the mining business, especially in underground mining. The Courrières mine disaster, Europe's worst mining accident, involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10, 1906. This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26, 1942, which killed 1,549 miners. While mining today is substantially safer than it
