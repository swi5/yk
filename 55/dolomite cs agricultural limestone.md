## Grolime Limestone | Agricultural Materials Supplier | Roadstone
Grolime. Grolime is an agricultural lime product used one the farm to optimise soil pH, and in turn to maximise farm efficiency. Soil pH plays a key role in soil fertility. Maintaining the soil pH at the optimum level will increase the microbiological activity of the soil and will result in better soil nutrient recycling and release.

## How To Use Dolomite Lime For Plants
Most plants grow best at a pH of 6.0 to 7.4 - neutral. If the soil is lower than 5.9, dolomite lime can be used to elevate the pH so that it is a bit more alkaline and amenable to healthy plant growth. While neutral soil is preferred by most plants, soil pH occasionally can veer more into the acidic or more alkaline territory.

Agricultural lime is a soil amendment product used to condition soil by raising pH levels. It is made from crushed limestone that contains natural nutrients to promote healthy plant growth. When lime is added to agricultural crops, it dissolves and releases a base that counteracts or neutralizes soil acidity. Types of Lime for Agricultural Crops :

Dolomite was the first fertilizer used to prevent hypomagnesemia (Cunningham, 1936).When applied at rates between 100 and 540 kg Mg/ha the Mg concentration of temperate forage is increased by 0.2-1.2 g/kg DM (Table 9.13).These increases in Mg concentration in the forage were associated with a rise in the level of exchangeable Mg in the soil (Jones, 1963b; Simpson, 1964).

Dolomitic Lime (often referred to as dolomite) is slightly different from agricultural lime. This particular material is manufactured by way of crushing dolomitic limestone into fine particulate matter. Because it is a type of limestone, you can count on the fact that it will also contain a very high calcium content.

Aglime, also known as agricultural limestone or dolomite, is a crushed stone product used primarily to control acidity (pH) in soils by making them more basic (alkaline). Crop fertilizers and herbicides can then work more efﬁ ciently, and plants can more readily absorb the nutrients that help them grow.

## What is Dolomite - Watheroo Dolomitic Lime
True Dolomite is sourced from rock and requires crushing and screening in order to be used in agriculture or industry. It is a carbonate limestone type product that should contain between 8-12% Magnesium as Mg and 18-22% Calcium as Ca.

## Soil acidity - frequently asked questions (FAQS) | Agriculture and Food
Essentially, the carbonate (CO 32-) from the calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) (lime) reacts with the acid in the soil (H+) to give carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water (H 2 O). If you add agricultural lime to vinegar (weak acid but stronger than the acidity of your soil) it will react and fizz to give carbon dioxide (the bubbles), water and calcium ions.

Odorless composted manure returns much-needed organic nutrients to your garden soil, breaks up clay-type soils and helps sandy soil better retain both nutrients and moisture. Lime is often used to keep your lawn greener and healthier. Its pH balances your soil, neutralizes soil acidity and can also make your fertilizers more effective.
