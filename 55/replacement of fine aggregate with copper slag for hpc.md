The mix design of M25 grade of concrete gives HPC concrete when replacement of copper slag is 50%. 2. In this case we observed that Copper slag behaves like river sand. 3. It is observed that when increasing percentage replacement of fine aggregate by Copper slag the unit weight of concrete is gradually increases. REFERENCES 1.

## Experimental Study on Concrete by Replacing Fine Aggregate Partially 
Replacement of copper slag in fine aggregates reduces the cost of making concrete. Replacement of copper slag increases the self weight of concrete specimens to the maximum of 15 to 25%. 25% addition of copper slag as fine aggregate in concrete gives more strength compare to 30% addition of copper slag as fine aggregate in concrete.

## Disadvantages of glass powder in concretehirn
Disadvantages of Manufactured Sand, Due to its smooth and angular textures, leads to more water and cement requirement to achieve the expected workability, thereby increase in overall costs. If the M Sand contains a large number of micro fine particles, it can affect the strength and workability of concrete . Conclusion,.
