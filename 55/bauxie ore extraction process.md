Bauxite is one of the world s most abundant minerals and is strip-mined in many places. Nearly all is processed into alumina for aluminium production. Bauxite contains iron-bearing clay or red mud, which often leaves stains on the hold paint that can prove difficult to remove. Bauxite is an aluminium ore and is the main source of aluminium.

Bauxite is the most common aluminium ore. Bauxite occurs as a weathered cover or blanket, known as laterite or duricrust, over a variety of alumina-bearing rocks. It forms when large amounts of rainfall leach away the more mobile elements in the host rock leaving the relatively immobile aluminium with some silicon, iron and titanium.
