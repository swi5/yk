From the XRD results, the reductive valence change of CuO, i.e. Cu 2+ → Cu 1+ → Cu or Cu 2+ → Cu, occurs during milling. This is consistent with a report that there are three ways [ 12, 13] to reduce Cu 2+ to Cu: (i) CuO → Cu 4 O 3 → Cu 2 O → Cu, (ii) CuO → Cu 2 O → Cu or (iii) CuO → Cu.

Three metal-organic frameworks Cu-BTC, Zn-BTC, and Cu/Zn-BTC were prepared and impregnated in nitrate solutions to obtain the precursors. After calcination, three metal-BTC-derived CuO/ZnO/CeO 2 /ZrO 2 catalysts were obtained. The samples were characterized and the catalyst-coated cordierite honeycomb ceramics were used in a microreactor for methanol steam reforming at different reaction

The purpose of this study was to improve the synthesis condition of the CuO-ZnO nanocomposite using a two-step protocol. Initially, an electrodeposition method was used to synthesize CuO nanoparticles (Nps) at different current densities (A/dm2) then assembled with ZnO Nps via a milling process to obtain different catalysts.

Oct 01, 2013 The p-n junction photocatalyst, p-CuO/n-ZnO, was prepared via ball milling of ZnO and CuO nanoparticles in water. The structural, optical, and surface properties of the p-n junction photocatalyst p-CuO/n-ZnO were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and Zeta potential analyzer

While mixing the TiO 2 and ZnO Nps by the ball milling process, the nanoparticles are evenly blended with each other forming nano-composites. The XRD pattern of the TZO NC displays diffraction peaks corresponding to both TiO 2 and ZnO Nps substantiating the presence of both phases in the nanocomposites (figure 1 (c)).
