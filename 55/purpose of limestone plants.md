## limestone | Characteristics, Formation, Texture, Uses, & Facts
Sep 9, 2022Limestone has two origins: (1) biogenic precipitation from seawater, the primary agents being lime-secreting organisms and foraminifera; and (2) mechanical transport and deposition of preexisting limestones, forming clastic deposits. Travertine, tufa, caliche, chalk, sparite, and micrite are all varieties of limestone.

## The Importance of Limestone
The oxides that are created by limestone in soil reduce the acidity of the soil, making it a more hospitable environment for the plants grown in the soil. Healthy plants come from healthy soil, and there are few supplements for your soil that are better or more effective than limestone.

## How To Use Dolomite Lime For Plants
Most plants grow best at a pH of 6.0 to 7.4 - neutral. If the soil is lower than 5.9, dolomite lime can be used to elevate the pH so that it is a bit more alkaline and amenable to healthy plant growth. While neutral soil is preferred by most plants, soil pH occasionally can veer more into the acidic or more alkaline territory.

Lime is used to convert iron into 'pig iron'. In the blast furnace, finely ground or granular limestone (with a low sulfur and alkali content) is used together with finely ground lime to convert ore into pig iron. The pig iron is later processed into steel. Lime is used as a fluxing agent in electric arc furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces.
