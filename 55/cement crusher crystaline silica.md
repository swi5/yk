The different crystalline forms of silica are known as 'polymorphs'. Crystalline silica is insoluble in water and doesn't evaporate. It melts at around 1,700˚C. In some circumstances, heating amorphous silica above about 1,000˚C can cause some of it to transform to a crystalline form, for example calcining diatomaceous earth.

In the 2,000 or so years since the Roman Empire employed a naturally occurring form of cement to build a vast system of concrete aqueducts and other large edifices, researchers have analyzed the molecular structure of natural materials and created entirely new building materials such as steel, which has a well-documented crystalline structure at the atomic scale.

An abundant natural material, crystalline silica is found in stone, soil, and sand. It is also found in concrete, brick, mortar, and other construction materials. Crystalline silica comes in several forms, with quartz being the most common. Quartz dust is respirable crystalline silica, which means it can be taken in by breathing.

Crystalline silica (quartz) is the form of silica that OSHA is writing the new regulations to cover, it is a health hazard. It is not reactive with portland cement, meaning it does not cause ASR (alkali-silica reactivity) regardless of particle size. Lots of countertop makers use 30 to 40 mesh crystalline silica sand in their GFRC mixes.
