## Gyratory Crusher - Design of mantle and concaves - Crushing, Screening 
The majority of gyratory crushers are used as primaries, i.e. they receive the initial feed from the mine or quarry. The same type of crusher with chamber modifications is used as a secondary crusher, particularly when following a large primary crusher. The fine-reduction gyratory crusher can also be used for tertiary crushing.
