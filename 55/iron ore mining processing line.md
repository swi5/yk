## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Effects of iron-ore mining and processing on metal bioavailability in a 
Mining and associated smelting and metal processing activities have led to perturbations in the cycling of metals in the surface environment. In this context, iron-ore mines act as important sources of major metals, mainly Fe and Mn, but also associated trace metals into the environment (Ratha and Venkataraman 1995; Wong 1981; Zabowski et al. 2001).

##  Iron Ore production in the Pilbara - Rio Tinto
Activities involved in finding, mining and processing iron ore at our Pilbara operations have been simplified in the following diagram. Rio Tinto operates 11 iron ore mines in the Pilbara and the specific sequence of activities varies from mine to mine. Excellence in planning, scheduling and quality control

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
