Ore processing was a mining procedure in which raw minerals were extracted and processed into useful components. The Cardassian mining station Terok Nor was used to process raw uridium ore from Bajor during their Occupation. Using Bajoran slave labor, the station was able to process up to 20,000 tons of ore a day. Since the Cardassians left Bajor and Terok Nor in 2369, the ore processing
