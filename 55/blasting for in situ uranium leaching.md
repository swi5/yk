In situ leach (ISL) mining ISL mining has environmental and safety advantages over conventional mining in that the ore body is dissolved and then pumped out, leaving minimal surface disturbance and no tailings or waste rock (World Nuclear Association, 2012). There is no ore dust or direct ore exposure to the environment and a lower consumption of water is needed in the mining process

## Mineral Processing And Extractive Metallurgy : 100 Years Of Innovation 
The move away from the dominating, century old batchwise drilling, blasting, mucking concept will however be slow. Initially new concepts such as in-situ leaching, continuous mining and blast-free mining will be introduced in special applications. Hardrock cutting, for example, will most likely first get introduced in narrow vein and reef mining.

## In Situ Leach Mining of Uranium - World Nuclear Association
The leach liquors pass through the ore to oxidise and dissolve the uranium minerals in situ. Depending on the type of leaching environment used the uranium will be complexed as either a uranyl sulphate, predominantly UO 2 (SO 4) 3 4-, in acid leach conditions or a uranyl carbonate, predominantly UO 2 (CO 3) 3 4-in a carbonate leach system.

## In Situ Leach and Conventional Uranium Recovery Methods
From 1972 through 1985, uranium recovery in Texas was dominated by conventional mining and milling. More recently, companies (licensees) have been using In Situ Leaching (ISL), a process that makes possible the recovery of uranium without disturbing the natural surface, generating dust, or producing waste known as tailings.
