coal mining, extraction of coal deposits from the surface of Earth and from underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. Its predominant use has always been for producing heat energy. It was the basic energy source that fueled the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the industrial growth of that era in turn supported the large-scale exploitation of coal

What is coal mining? Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal, since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity. As one kind of energy, steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth.

3. Processing Chemicals Pollution. This kind of pollution occurs when chemical agents (such as cyanide or sulphuric acid used by mining companies to separate the target mineral from the ore) spill, leak, or leach from the mine site into nearby water bodies. These chemicals can be highly toxic to humans and wildlife. 4.

## Coal: Extraction and Energy Production Impacts on Birds
Without proper care, coal mining (both surface and subsurface) can destroy land and pollute water. When coal is then burned to produce energy, it gives off carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas that is linked with global warming. Burning coal also produces emissions, such as sulfur, nitrogen oxide, and mercury that can pollute the air and water.

The effect of coal mining is not only limited to air pollution, but has further resulted in global warming all over the world. During coal mining activities, a number of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide and other heat-trapping gases are produced which remain in the atmosphere for several years once emitted

## CDC - Mining Topic - Respiratory Diseases - NIOSH
Since 1970, NIOSH has compiled data on the prevalence of CWP in underground coal miners. The graph shows a summary of this data. In the early 1970s, the prevalence of CWP was 33% among miners working 25 or more years. The prevalence dropped to less than 5% by the late 1990s. However, since that time, CWP prevalence has increased to more than 10

## Coal Mines in the Industrial Revolution - History Learning
In 1841 about 216,000 people were employed in the mines in Britain. Most coal was mined in the north and the north-east as well as the Midlands and some parts of Scotland. Due to the difficulties of moving coal many towns and industries were established around the large coal mines. How did coal production increase? 1700 : 2.7 million tonnes

## The relationship between the mining industry and communities
Australia recently revoked the protection status of over 1385 ha of Wangan and Jagalingou country in Queensland which is now earmarked for coal mining under the multinational firm Adani. The move has been met with great consternation by the indigenous tribes who use part of the area as traditional ceremonial grounds.
