The aggregates crushing value test should be performed as per IS code 2386 Part IV. First, fill the sample aggregate with one-third of the cylindrical measure in three layers. Each layer should be tamped 25times freely. After filling the sample aggregate, weigh and record it as W1. Now fill the aggregate in the mould along with the plunger on top.

## Aggregate Crushing Strength Test - Online CivilForum
The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.

Limestone: A sedimentary rock that is the most commonly used to make crushed stone in the United States. One of the most versatile rocks for construction, limestone is able to be crushed easily making it a primary rock used in ready-mix concrete, road construction, and railroads. It is widely available in quarries across the country.
