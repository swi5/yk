## beneficiation of high grade magnetite」
The Beneficiation Techniques for 5 Types of Iron Ores in Compared with the iron ore required in industrial production, magnetite has a lower grade and high exploitation cost. The Beneficiation process is guided by the principles of " more crushing and less grinding ", " more energysaving and low costs ".
