## Types Of Coal Pulverizers
 The four most common coal pulverizers types are: Ball-Tube Mills. This type of mill consists of a rotating tube filled with cast alloy balls. Coal is introduced through two hollow trunnions on each side of the tube. As the tube rotates, the balls tumble onto the coal, crushing and pulverizing it.

## Types of pulverised coal firing system - BrainKart
The pulverising mill grinds the coal at a steady rate irrespective of boiler feed. 2. There is always some coal in reserve. Thus any occasional breakdown in the coal supply will not affect the coal feed to the burner. 3. For a given boiler capacity pulverising mill of small capacity will be required as compared to unit system.

Coal Pulverizer Types (Impact, Crush and Attrition) The type of pulverizer employed depends upon requirements. Pulverizers typically utilise three main types of grinding: Impact - an external force impacts with the coal. This type of grinding can be compared to when a hammer hits an object e.g. a piece of coal.

## Why pulverized coal is used in power plant?pro
Why pulverized coal is used over conventional fuel firing? The concept of burning coal that has been pulverized into a fine powder stems from the belief that if the coal is made fine enough, it will burn almost as easily and efficiently as a gas.  It is a type of bituminous coal. Hence, lignite has the least carbon content which means that
