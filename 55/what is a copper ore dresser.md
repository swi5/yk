In most cases, the thin-layer process was used where crushed ores (80% −0.5 in) were stacked in heaps of 3-8 m height after agglomeration and sprayed at flow rates of 6-40 L·hour −1 ·m −2 with 15-90 days duration for copper oxides and 10-18 months for sulfides. Of note, 80%-85% copper extraction was commonly achieved.

## Copper Ore | More than Conquerors
Copper is one of the oldest metals ever used and important in the development of civilization. What is Copper Ore. There are two distinct types of copper ore, sulfide ore and oxide ore. Currently, the most common source of copper ore is the sulfide ore mineral chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), which accounts for about 50 percent of copper production.

## Copper Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Copper ore usually contains about 0.5 to 2% copper that occurs in the form of disseminated and stringers. The run of mine ore is reduced from 150 mm to 25 mm size in Jaw and Cone crushers. The crushed ore is grinded in ball mills to −74 μm size. The ore is processed by froth flotation comprising rougher and scavenger cells.

## what is a copper ore dresser
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 9999% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday useThe most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and
