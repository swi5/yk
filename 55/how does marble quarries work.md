## How Does Marble Get Mined From a Quarry? - RIOSTONES
Mining marble blocks from the wall of the quarry starts with a "bench wall.". The bench wall is a large section of marble along a vertical wall that is cut with diamond cables, drills, and torches. Dynamite loosens the bench wall from the side of the quarry, and the separated wall can then be processed and cut into individual, uniform blocks.

The Carrara quarries have been prized since the days of the Roman Empire, but the geologic processes that developed these rocks dwarf human timescales. Marble's origins actually lie in marine organisms that leave behind their calcite-rich shells when they die. As water bodies evaporate, these deposited remains form limestone.
