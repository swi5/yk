## Process of Crushing Stone for Concrete Recycling - ReAgg
The procedure of crushing the stone has three stages. The first stage is breaking down the stone to small sizes. The second stage is crushing down the sizable stones to suit a specific purpose. On the third stage, the stones are screened for finished products. Sand and gravel are the most common minerals used in creating concrete.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
