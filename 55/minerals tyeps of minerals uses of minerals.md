Oxides: When an ore is found in which one or more elements are combined with oxygen, it is an oxide mineral. These may have chemical formulas of the type XO (MgO, ZnO, CuO, etc.), X 2 O (Cu 2 O), X 2 O 3 (Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3), XO 2 (MnO 2, SnO 2) and XY 2 O 4 (MgAl 2 O 4, FeCr 2 O 4).The oxide minerals are mostly of metallic elements. Example: hematite, magnetite, and cuprite.

Minerals can cleave into thin sheets (mica), or rods (some types of asbestos), or octahedrons (fluorite), or rhombic prisms (calcite), as well as other forms. Some minerals don't cleave; instead, they fracture unevenly. Some minerals like quartz display conchoidal fracture, which looks sort of like the inside of an oyster, smooth and curving.
