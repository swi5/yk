Copper production from oxides in Chile has been in a steady decline for the last 20 years. More copper is discovered at depths as copper oxide reserves closer to the surface are depleted. Copper oxide discoveries will become rare in the future and by 2029 copper production from this sources in Chile is expected to fall from 26% to 11.6%.

## Method for producing copper oxide - Hickson Corporation
Abstract: A method for producing copper oxide. In the method, a copper bearing material, aqueous ammonia, and a sufficient amount of an ammonium salt to double the rate of production of copper oxide in the absence of the salt are placed in a single vessel. The vessel is closed, and oxygen is fed into the vessel.

## Industrial: Powder Metallurgy - Production and Properties - Copper
Cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O), cupric oxide (CuO) and cuprous sulfide (Cu 2 S) are produced as powders by the controlled reaction of oxygen with copper powder. The products are used in antifouling paints (Cu 2 O), reagents in chemical reactions, catalysts in the production of silicone compounds and in foundries for hydrogen degassing of non-ferrous melts.

## Copper Oxide - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Cuprite is a copper oxide mineral (Cu2 O) with cochineal-red, crimson-red, and black color and shining brown, red streak. Cuprite was discovered in 1845, and the name derived from the Latin word "cuprum" meaning copper. The distinctive red color crystal resembles "ruby" and known as "ruby copper.".

These metals highlight the material properties of the element, and 1100 aluminum is the most common "pure" aluminum grade, with less than 1% added elements like zinc, copper, or silicon for strength. Even with those additions, this family is not as strong as other families of aluminum, but the alloys are easy to work and resistant to corrosion.
