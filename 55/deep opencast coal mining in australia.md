The opencast coal mining technique is used in areas were the coal reserves are scattered in shallow and thin seams and cannot be extracted by deep mining methods (Beynon et al., 2000). The opencast process starts with exploration activities to identify where there are deposits of coal and what is the depth of the seams.

In India coal seams with inclination as steep as 1 in 3 have been worked by mechanised opencast mining methods in Karanpura field. Seams at shallow depths which are actively gassy, liable to spontaneous heating or with bad roof should preferably be extracted by quarrying as the mining legislation for underground working of such seams is stringent.

A major part of iron ore, non-ferrous metals, brown coal, building materials and minerals for industry is being excavated in open-cast mines. This type of mining has a deep impact on the natural strata. Open-cast mining changes geological, hydrological and geotechnical conditions. It influences the existing ecological system and landscape.

Surface mining - also known as opencast or opencut mining - is only economic when the coal seam is near the surface. This method recovers a higher proportion of the coal deposit than underground mining as all coal seams are exploited - 90% or more of the coal can be recovered.
