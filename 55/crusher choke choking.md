## crushing chamber
Feb 17, 2016 · The choke-point in a crushing chamber is that level in the chamber where the capacity of the crusher is a minimum; that is, it is the bottle neck of the crushing chamber. It follows that it is the point where choking is most likely to occur, particularly so if the choke is promoted by a condition existing within the crusher.

## How to Prevent Crusher Choking - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
It is apparent that the choke-point in the crushing chamber we have been discussing is at the discharge level, or immediately above it. It is equally clear that the unit pressures in such a chamber increase progressively from the top, down, reaching their maximum value at the choke-point, where the voids are at a minimum.

## benefits of the non choking a crusher
As with other compression crushers, the cone crusher yields a somewhat elongated and slivery particle shape. This may be minimized, however, by "choke" feeding the crusher. This technique will also make the shape and size more uniform. One way to choke feed is with a surge hopper and a controlled belt-feed to the cone crusher (Figure 5-10).
