Well, Bentonite Clay may not have a hindi name since this was not an "India"n clay (based on my research).

Also, the name Bentonite seems to have its origin from the site where it was found, Fort Benton, America.

The Indian bentonite is essentially plastic clay with flexible viscosity. It contains almost 85% montmorillonite, a clay mineral.

## Bentonite
Bentonite (/ ˈ b ɛ n t ə n aɪ t /) is an absorbent swelling clay consisting mostly of montmorillonite (a type of smectite) which can either be Na-montmorillonite or Ca-montmorillonite.Na-montmorillonite has a considerably greater swelling capacity than Ca-montmorillonite. Bentonite usually forms from the weathering of volcanic ash in seawater, or by hydrothermal circulation through the

## Bentonite | Imerys
Bentonite is a very soft plastic clay consisting predominantly of montmorillonite, a fine particle-sized hydrous aluminum silicate and member of the smectite group. Most bentonites are formed by the alteration of volcanic ash and rocks after intense contact with water. Bentonite presents strong colloidal properties and increases its volume
