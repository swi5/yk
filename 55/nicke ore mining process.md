Solar et al. (2008) noted two trends in nickel laterites processing, one favoring high-grade ferronickel (35% to 40% Ni) and the other favoring lower grades (20% to 25% Ni). Because the ores processed vary widely in terms of nickel content and other components, it is natural that both lower and higher reduction degrees are used.
