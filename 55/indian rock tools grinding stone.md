A single-disc grinder has a working width of 10 to 12 inches while a dual-disc unit covers 20 or more inches in one pass. Disc rotation speeds range from about 250 to over 3,000 rpm. On multiple-disc units, the discs usually are counter-rotating to provide balanced torque so the grinder won't pull from side to side.

Most Stone Age flint implements don't look much like a modern tool so you can't go by general appearance. If your find "looks like" a thing for making holes or a screwdriver or an axe head, it probably isn't an artefact but a geofact - a piece of rock, typically flint, that by chance happens to look like a modern tool or ornament.
