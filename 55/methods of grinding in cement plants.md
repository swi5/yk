## How Cement Is Made
The most common way to manufacture portland cement is through a dry method. The first step is to quarry the principal raw materials, mainly limestone, clay, and other materials. After quarrying the rock is crushed.  After the clinker is cooled, cement plants grind it and mix it with small amounts of gypsum and limestone. Cement is so fine
