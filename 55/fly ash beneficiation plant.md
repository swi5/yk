Combustion of coal in thermal power plants produces fly ash. There are different types of coal namely anthracite, bituminous, sub bituminous and lignite. Classification of coal is based on the content of volatile matter and carbon. Coal which has less volatiles and high carbon is of superior quality.

## Potassium
Potassium is a chemical element with the symbol K (from Neo-Latin kalium) and atomic number 19. Potassium is a silvery-white metal that is soft enough to be cut with a knife with little force. Potassium metal reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only seconds of exposure. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives.
