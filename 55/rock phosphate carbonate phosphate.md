Mar 29, 2021More than 80% of the rock phosphate produced worldwide is used to produce fertilizers and animal feed supplements. It is necessary to explain that the concentration of P 2 O 5 in phosphate rocks that are suitable for chemical fertilizer production should be at least 28%. The concentration of this substance in high-quality rocks is 30% or more.

## Use of phosphate rocks for sustainable agriculture
Phosphate rock (PR) is a general term that describes naturally occurring mineral assemblages containing a high concentration of phosphate minerals. The term refers to both unbeneficiated phosphate ores and concentrated products. Sedimentary deposits have provided about 80- 90 percent of world production in the last ten years.

## Phosphate Rock | Mosaic Crop Nutrition
Phosphate rock comes from geologic deposits located around the world. Its main constituent is apatite, a calcium phosphate mineral primarily extracted from sedimentary marine deposits, with a small amount obtained from igneous sources. Most phosphate rock is recovered through surface mining, although some is extracted from underground mines.

Rock phosphate. Rock phosphate is a naturally occurring ore of marine sedimentary origin. It may have a composition of 0-30-0, but the grade is noted as 0-3-0, since rock phosphate is sparingly soluble and little of the phosphorus is available to crops. Many of the mines that produced rock phosphate are closed, and most of the marketed rock

## Calcium Phosphate - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Apatite ( Fig. 1.12) is a group of natural calcium mineralÂ±fluorine and chlorine (Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 (F, Cl, OH)). The mineral primarily occurs as phosphate rock. The large apatite deposits are located in China, Canada, the United States, Europe, Russia, and India. Apatite is used as a source of phosphorus, phosphoric acid, and fertilizers.

## Rock Phosphate | Oracle Chemicals
Rock Phosphate is formed in oceans in the form of calcium phosphate, called phosphorite. Phosphorus is a very important piece of the DNA and RNA molecules of which all life is formed. It is also important for the development of teeth and bones. The name phosphorus comes from the Greek word phosphorous, which means bringer of light.

The general formula for pure rock phosphate is Ca10(PO4)6(X)2, where X is Fâ, OHâ or Clâ. These minerals are called apatites. The most common rock phosphate mined is fluorapatite, which contains impurities like CO3, Na and Mg.
