## Removal of Fluoride from Water Using a Calcium-Modified Dairy Manure 
Introduction. As the thirteenth most abundant element in the Earth's crust (625 mg kg −1), fluoride leaches into surface water and groundwater from fluorine-bearing rocks and minerals due to natural weathering and hydrogeochemical interactions (Edmunds and Smedley 2005).Fluoride is commonly found in almost all groundwater ranging from <0.5 to 10 mg L −1 and sometimes greater than 330 mg
