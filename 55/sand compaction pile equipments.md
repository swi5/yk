Although the compact size of skid steers results in a very useful piece of equipment, the compact size also results in hazards to the operator and bystanders. The compact size results in a short wheelbase and narrow track width that decreases the stability of the skid steer and increases the possibility of roll over accidents. The skid steer can accommodate a variety of different tools

Soil compaction occurs when soil particles are pressed together, reducing pore space between them (Figure 1). Heavily compacted soils contain few large pores, less total pore volume and, consequently, a greater density. A compacted soil has a reduced rate of both water infiltration and drainage. This happens because large pores more effectively

## Stone And Sand Column Vibro Compaction Piling Vibroflot For Soil 
Vibroflotation involves the use of a vibrating probe that can penetrate granular soil to depths of over 100 feet. The vibrations of the probe cause the grain structure to collapse thereby densifying the soil surrounding the probe. To treat an area of potentially liquefiable soil, the vibroflot is raised and lowered in a grid pattern.

## Soil compaction | UMN Extension - University of Minnesota
What is compaction? Soil compaction occurs when soil particles are pressed together, reducing pore space between them (Figure 1). Heavily compacted soils contain few large pores, less total pore volume and, consequently, a greater density. A compacted soil has a reduced rate of both water infiltration and drainage. This happens because large pores more effectively move water downward through
