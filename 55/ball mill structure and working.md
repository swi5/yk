## ball mill construction working principle applications
Ball mill working principle. grinding is usually performed wet, although in certain applications dry grinding is used. when the mill is rotated, the mixture of medium, ore, and water, known as the mill charge, is intimately mixed; the medium comminuting the particles depends on the speed of rotation of the mill and the shell liner structure.

## Ball mill
A ball mill, a type of grinder, is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores, chemicals, ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including ceramic balls, flint pebbles, and stainless steel balls.
