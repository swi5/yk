## experimental chemistry - Factors affecting yield of reaction 
1. 1) You are correct for question one, since the product is still wet you will weigh both your product + the water, so the true mass will be less than that weighed. 2) Your yield will be lower. Since you you less reactant (14g instead of 15g), your yield will be less than it would be if you used 15g. Since you calculate your theoretical yield

## Why is 100 yield not attainable in the laboratory?
The percent yield is the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield, expressed as a percentage.  However, percent yields greater than 100% are possible if the measured product of the reaction contains impurities that cause its mass to be greater than it actually would be if the product was pure.

This is due to low rainfall. The consequences of low rainfall include: (1) High temperature, (2) Reduced plant growth and (3) Increase in Ph. All these factors had an adverse effect on cotton crop and resulted in low per acre yield and production of crop in Punjab.

## Discussion | Course Hero
Discussion: The low percent yield could have been caused by a variety of causes, but there are 2 most likely reasons. The first reason is that a great deal of product was not able to be removed from the container it was prepared in and therefore the yield was lower than it should have been. A second reason for the low yield could potentially be that some of the components were spilled during

Preface: The problem is that you have overstated your percentage yield, and the symptom is that it is above 100%. Example: You and your friend each do an experiment where the literature states the yield should be ~65%. You both use poor technique and fail to dry your product, causing you to attribute water mass as product mass.

## 5 Common Errors in Tensile Testing | - Quality Mag
Poorly conducted tests are detrimental to a quality program. Here are five common errors in tensile testing, and ways to correct them: 1. Wrong load cell capacity. The accuracy of load cells used with tensile testing machines is normally rated in one of two ways: 1. Percentage of full scale, or 2.

## Which factors determine the percentage yield in a laboratory 
Experimental preparations of compounds usually follow the standard methodology, i.e. 1. reaction. 2. work-up. 3. purification. The theoretical yield can be simply calculated froma knowledge of the stoichiometry of the reaction (s) involved in the preparation. The final percentage yield is calculated from actual yield/theoretical yield x 100%.

To obtain the highest yield, hybrid sorghum should be harvested for hay when the seeds are between the soft and dough stage, but curing is difficult at this time. Harvesting when the forage is about 80 cm high results in a better quality hay that is easier to cure, and one or two additional crops may be produced ( Undersander et al., 2003 ).
