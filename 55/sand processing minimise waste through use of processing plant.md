## Meat Processing - Hydroflotech
It is not unusual for a typical meat processing to generate 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 gallons of wastewater daily for a small to medium sized facility. This water will be laden with fats, proteins and carbohydrates from meat, fat, blood, skin and feathers. The water is also polluted with a fair amount of grit and other inorganic matter.

Wastewater is generated in homes, industries, agricultural fields and in other human activities. This is called sewage. Sewage is a liquid waste which causes water and soil pollution. Wastewater is treated in a sewage treatment plant. Treatment plants reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level where nature can take care of it.
