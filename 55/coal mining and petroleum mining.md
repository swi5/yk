## COAL MINING IN IOWA - University of Northern Iowa
Iowa coal mining grew rapidly from 1870 to 1920. The graph, "Coal Production in Iowa, 1860 - 1938, " shows the decline of coal production after 1920. Mining declined for several reasons. The railroads began buying coal from other states such as Illinois and Kentucky. As a result, the mining industry in Iowa was thrown into competition with the

## Underground Coal Mining - Australian Mining
In this issue of Australian Mining Magazine, the equipment and practices used in underground coal mining will be explored.. Underground coal mining can have a significant impact on the earth's natural features. This feature will examine the root causes of accidents during movement of materials, redesign and developing equipment, and how accidents can be avoided.

1. Introduction. Southwestern Pennsylvania has served for centuries as a producer of coal, oil, and natural gas. Coal mines were first developed in the Pittsburgh Coal Seam in the 1760s, with the first recorded mine in 1761 being the Fort Pitt Mine .Natural gas was introduced to the region when the Haymaker Well in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, experienced a blowout in November 3, 1878.

Uses of Coal. It is mainly used to generate heat and electricity. It is used in households and in industries to accomplish various tasks. It is the cheapest source of power fuel. The iron and steel industry depends heavily on fossil fuel for energy. It is also used to produce useful products such as coke, tar, and coal gas.
