## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.

## Wet or Dry Polishing? What Is Right For Your Job
Wet has its advantages. Wet grinding and polishing also increase diamond life dramatically on medium-hard to very hard floors and allow for more aggressive grinding. Grinding wet can effectively remove a significant layer of concrete to expose aggregate. It allows the diamonds to cut faster on medium-hard and very hard floors.

## Can wet grinder be used for dry grinding?145
What is difference between wet grinder and dry grinder? The particles ride along in the liquid and are crushed among the grinding media. Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation.
