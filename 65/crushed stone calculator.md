## Gravel Calculator
Crushed stone. Crushed stone is a type of medium-sized gravel that is formed by mechanically crushing stone. Most commonly, limestone, dolomite, or granite is crushed to form the crushed stone. In certain definitions of the term, crushed stone is not considered gravel since it is a processed rather than naturally-occurring rock fragment.

You have 2 main types of stone for this size, crushed and pea stone. Crushed stone is exactly how it sounds, crushed. It is broken up fragments of stone crushed down into a 3/8" size. This means the stone is misshaped and jagged. This stone is more neutral in color. Pea stone or pea gravel is more rounded in shape. This stone is found naturally.

Jan 20, 2021As an example, a 10-foot wide, 20-foot long driveway is a 200-square foot area. Then, multiply the area by the depth. For instance, if you are using four inches of crushed stone under a patio area or for a driveway, four inches converted to feet is .33. So, our calculation is .33 x 200 ÷ 27, or 2.46 cubic yards.
