## Concrete test cube manufacturing and curing procedures
The cube strength of concrete is specifi ed by a structural engineer and is assessed by crushing concrete cubes at a specifi ed age (28 days after casting). Early strength may also be assessed at 3 or 7 days after casting. The preparation, handling, curing and testing of concrete cubes are done according to SANS 5861-3: 2006 Concrete Tests

Poor Workmanship - Using more hand trowel actions while placing the concrete leads to the improper settlement of concrete and raises cement paste to the surface and makes water bleeding. It later forms the crazing. Excessive Use of Cement - To give a smooth finish on the concrete finish, labours try to sprinkle cement on the surface.

## Compressive Strength of Concrete Cylinders - The Constructor
The compressive strength of the concrete cylinder is one of the most common performance measures performed by the engineers in the structural design.
