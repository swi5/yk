## MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION DURING EXTRUSION OF AA3xxx ALUMINUM ALLOYS
The through process microstructural evolution of aluminum alloys AA3003 (1.27wt% Mn) and AA3102 (0.26wt% Mn) during high temperature extrusion was investigated. The Direct Chill(DC) cast microstructure of both alloys showed interdendritic eutectic regions consisting of rod/plate like constituent particles in the α-Al.

A magnesium alloy containing Al 2 Y particles was successfully fabricated by changing the content of Al in the Mg-6Y alloy melt. Its microstructure and mechanical properties were subsequently characterized. The results show that two types of Al 2 Y particles were discovered in the Mg-6Y-xAl (x = 0.5-5) alloys, which are namely the polygonal particles in the pre-precipitated phase and the

## Aluminium
Aluminium (aluminum in American and Canadian English) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13. Aluminium has a density lower than those of other common metals, at approximately one third that of steel. It has a great affinity towards oxygen, and forms a protective layer of oxide on the surface when exposed to air

After the batch was melted, the alloy was treated with refining salt. After treatment, alloying of the alloy was performed by introducing Cr75 alloying tablets with mechanical mixing for about 15-20 min.

Magnesium alloys are alloys formed by adding other elements to the metal magnesium base. Magnesium (Mg) has a density of 1.8g/cm3, which is 2/3 of aluminum (Al) and only 1/4 of iron (Fe), which is the lowest density among metals used. At the same time, Mg has high specific strength, elastic modulus, and good thermal conductivity.

Magnesium is the major alloying element in the 5xxx series of alloys. Its maximum solid solubility in aluminum is 17.4%, but the magnesium content in current wrought alloys does not exceed 5.5%. Manganese is a common impurity in primary aluminum, in which its concentration normally ranges from 5 to 50 ppm. It decreases resistivity.
