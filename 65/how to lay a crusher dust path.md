## Base Preparation for Walkways/Driveways - Pepper Landscape Supply
The most common technique is non-open graded base. What this means is that the compacted granular base portion of the job is using a 3⁄4" Crusher Run Gravel (also called Granular "A"). This is a combination of angular 3⁄4" stone mixed with fines and when compacted this material creates a solid base for the next step; the bedding course.

## DIY Crusher Fines Garden Path - Plant Addicts
Dec 10, 2020Spray the crusher fine with water before your last tamp. It helps bind the crusher fine mix. (And the color of the path really comes out after rain.) Keep a small pile of crusher fine handy for a few weeks, or at least after a few rains. You might find low spots or phantom folds poking through.

## What crusher dust is - Blog Paragon Gardens
When it comes to a healthy and robust lawn or any other plant, compaction is the enemy. When turf is grown in crusher dust, which means that it is growing in rock, it has shallow root growth causing the plant to always be thirsty and reliant on frequent watering. As we know, this has a disastrous result in times of drought and water restrictions.
