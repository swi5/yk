## Mines rework lithium targets after huge deals - The Zimbabwe Independent
According to an African Mining Markets report, Zimbabwe is the leading country in Africa in lithium production. Battery metal specialists say the drive for clean technology initiatives and off-grid power storage has created an enormous demand for lithium batteries and electric vehicles in recent years. This demand is expected to accelerate rapidly.

Solonopole permits cover historic artisanal mining sites previously mined for lithium, Coltan (tantalum and niobium) and tin; Over 20 historical small-scale mines have been identified in field exploration. Mining was only undertaken to less than 10 meters vertical depth due to restrictions of hard pegmatite material requiring blasting.

Mining and producing battery-grade lithium carbonate requires important investments. Recent estimates from lithium experts at Roskill has estimated that the marginal costs of producing refined lithium of both carbonate and hydroxide would range between $6,000-$8,000/t through to 2036. This might explain why only a few countries have been able.
