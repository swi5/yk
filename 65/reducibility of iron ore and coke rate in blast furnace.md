enhancement of iron ore sinter reducibility through coke. Nov 06, 2019 Blast furnace reports show that the coke consumption during this period was abt. 1000 to 1100 kgs/m. ton iron, when open-hearth iron with a Si-content of about 1 % was produced and about 1200 kgs. coke/m.ton iron in the case of foundry iron with a Si-content of about 3 %

## What is the difference between pellet and sinter?
Why coke is used in blast furnace not coal? Coke is used as a fuel and a reducing agent in melting iron ore. It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke, making it ideal for smelting iron and steel.

## Blast furnace ironmaking and its ferrous burden quality requirements 
Jan 1, 2022Effect of burden reducibility on blast furnace coke rate (Ranade, 2000; Blattner et al., 1984). During indirect reduction, iron oxides are reduced through a solid/gas reaction mechanism. At intermediate temperatures, solid/gas reactions are likely to be controlled by mixed gas diffusion and chemical reaction on the pore surface of the solid.

## Coupled Typical Coke Gasification and Sintering Ore Reduction in CO-N2 
3 days agoThe preceding results demonstrate that the arrangement of iron ore and coke layers in a blast furnace causes a coupling effect between coke gasification and sintering ore reduction. In a hydrogen-rich BF, when the contents of CO and H 2 change, the contents of CO 2 and H 2 O generated in the reduction process of iron ore are directly affected

## Determination of the fundamental softening and melting characteristics 
A study was undertaken to investigate the way the quality of the iron-bearing materials and coke affects blast furnace performance. Laboratory tests are described which studied low temperature degradation, reducibility, and softening underload of the sinter and pellet material and reactivity of the coke.

## How to break agglomerates?
The typical iron (Fe) content of sinter is around 55-58%, while BF pellets are normally 62-66% Fe. BF pellets have a higher Fe content as they are manufactured from low- grade ores that are finely ground prior to undergoing mineral beneficiation treatments.
