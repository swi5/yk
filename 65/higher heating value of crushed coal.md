## higher heating value of crushed ore
1/29/2020· The stored energy potential within coal is described as the calorific value, heating value, or heat content. It's measured in British thermal units Btu or millijoules per kilogram MJ/kg. A Btu is the amount of heat that will warm approximately 0.12 U.S. gallonsa pound of waterby 1 degree Fahrenheit at sea level.

## Conversion Higher Heating Value (HHV) to Lower Heating Value (LHV)
LHV = HHV - 10.55 (W + 9H) Where: LHV = lower heating value of fuel (BTU/lb) HHV = higher heating value of fuel (Btu/lb) W = weight percent of moisture in fuel. H = weight percent of hydrogen in fuel. For fast analysis, I found that we can convert HHV to LHV using simple relationship below:

Heating value is the amount of heat obtained when fuel or some other substance of a specific unit quantity is combusted. There are two types of heating values: The lower heating value (net) is the difference between combustion and latent heat of vaporization of the water vapors formed from combustion. The upper heating value (gross) is the heat
