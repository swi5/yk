Difference of granite, limestone make sand. August.03,2022. There are many kinds of stones that can be used to make sand. Among them, pebbles, granite, basalt, etc. are often selected as raw materials for sand making, because these stones have higher hardness and the quality of the sand will be better, which is more in line with the material requirements of the construction industry.

The petroleum industry also uses sand. Under pressure, sand is injected into an oil well. The sand goes into the cracks and crevices where the oil is trapped. When the pressure is released, the sand helps hold the cracks open. When this process works, oil production can be increased greatly. The process is called sand-fracturing.
