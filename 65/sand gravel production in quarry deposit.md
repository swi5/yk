## Industrial Minerals - Colorado Geological Survey
Colorado quarry operators produced 51.81 million tons of aggregate (sand, gravel, and crushed stone) in 2018. The estimated 2018 production value was $284 million for sand and gravel and $141 million for crushed stone (see IS-82 for more information). The cost of aggregate to the user is highly dependent on aggregate transportation costs.

Aggregate quarrying begins with removing the overburden to expose the sand, gravel, or stone. Soil and partially weathered rock can be pushed aside with a bulldozer and removed with conventional loaders and haul trucks. Organic soil commonly is stripped separately from the rest of the overburden and stockpiled for reclamation activities.

## Mining and Quarrying - Frequently Asked Questions - Maine
Much of the sand and gravel used for construction purposes in Maine was deposited by water melted from glaciers. If possible, water runs downhill so most gravel deposits are found in valleys and other lowlands where they were laid down in glacial outwash streams, glacial lakes, or the ocean. Ice-tunnel deposits (eskers) are notable exceptions.

Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.
