## Coal: Anthracite, Bituminous, Coke, Pictures, Formation, Uses - Geology
Electricity production is the primary use of coal in the United States. Most of the coal mined in the United States is transported to a power plant, crushed to a very small particle size, and burned. Heat from the burning coal is used to produce steam, which turns a generator to produce electricity.
