## Review on Beneficiation Techniques and Reagents Used for Phosphate Ores
Phosphate ore is an important raw material for manufacturing fertilizers and phosphorous chemical products. While most of the phosphate resources cannot be directly treated as feed stock due to the low grade of P2O5 and high content of impurities. In order to obtain a qualified phosphate concentrate, the beneficiation of the low-grade phosphate ore is, hence, of great necessity.

Phosphorus is common within geological materials. The average continental crust contains 0.27% P 2 O 5. 1 Phosphorus is the primary resources to produce fertilizer and phosphorous-based products. 2 Phosphorus is neither substitutable nor recyclable, therefore, the total demand must be provided through the mining, beneficiation and chemical processing of phosphate ores.
