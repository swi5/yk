2019/12/03· So nearly all rocks on the planet have some metal or mineral content. However, the concentration of this metal is too less for it to be valuable. Ores usually have a very high content of the desired mineral, but it still must be separated from other mixed impurities, this method is known as the concentration of ores.

Gold can be freed from these ores or concentrates by treating them with various oxidizing processes. The most common method is to roast gold-bearing minerals at temperatures of 450° to 750° C (840° to 1,380° F) to destroy the interfering sulfides. Oxidation can also be accomplished by the use of high-pressure reactors called autoclaves, in

The physical or chemical properties of the gangue and ores determine the method employed to extract them from the ore. Ore concentration can be accomplished through a variety of methods, including hydraulic washing, magnetic separation, froth flotation, and leaching. The next sections go through some of the processes used to concentrate the ore.

## How to Process Copper Ore: Beneficiation Methods and Equipment
Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm.
