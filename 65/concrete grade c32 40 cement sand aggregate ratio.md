According to studies published in multiple papers, waste glass and glass powder have all been effectively employed as partial replacements for fine and coarse aggregates in concrete . Waste glass particles can improve concrete's compressive strength, flexural strength, workability, and tensile strength, according to the findings.

## c32 40 concrete cement sand gravel mix ratio
Concrete blocks are often made of 1:3:6 concrete with a maximum size aggregate of 10mm or a cement-sand mixture with a ratio of 1:7, 1:8 or 1:9. These mixtures, if properly cured, give concrete blocks a compression strength well above what is required in a one-storey building.

Aug 19, 2021The mix proportions ratio of concrete details the proportion of cement, sand and water it needs to make that particular strength of concrete. For example M20 grade of concrete is the mix ratio 1:1.5:3. The "1" is cement, "1.5" is fine aggregate and "3" is coarse aggregate. This mix applies to all grades of concrete.

## Cement, Sand And Granite (concrete) Mix Explained - Nairaland
We'll start by explaining what the ratio 1:2:4, 1:3:6 etc. means - What this means is the Cement, Fine aggregate and Coarse aggregate ratio. Where fine aggregate could be Sharp Sand or Stone dust and Coarse aggregate could be granite, gravel or stone-base (for certain project types). 1:2:4 therefore means, 1 part of cement : 2 part of fine
