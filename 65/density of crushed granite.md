##  Physical and mechanical properties of decomposed granite soils sampled 
permeability of decomposed granite soil is in a range of 10-3 to 10-5 cm/s. However, if decomposed granite soil is compacted, particle crushing occurs and the soil will become denser and thus the permeability will decrease down to even below 10-5 cm/s. Unlike sand, decomposed granite soil is characterized by the fact that Darcy's law is

## Granite
Granite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ n ə t /) is a coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase.It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous intrusions.These range in size from dikes only a few centimeters

## Density of crushed stone: bulk and true density of crushed stone 5-20 
The quality of granite is judged from how far the resulting value of the density of crushed stone is from the density of granite - 2.7 g / cm3 (or 2.7 kg / dm3). Too different from the "granite" value of the absolute density suggests that the crushed stone is not made of granite at all, but, say, basalt or, in general, secondary.

Feb 18, 2014· According to About the density of granite ranges from 2.6-2.7 g/cm 3 and basalt is 2.8-3.0 g/cm 3. Since gabbro and basalt are made of the same minerals, their densities are similar. Gabbro's density ranges from 2.7-3.3 g/cm 3. The day after the lab is a good time to question the students about the significance of rock
