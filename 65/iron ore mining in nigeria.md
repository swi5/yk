## Why prices of Iron Ore, others may rise soon - Nairametrics
The mining of minerals in Nigeria accounts for only 0.3% of its gross domestic product, due to the nation's overdependence on its vast oil resources. China accumulated a majority of the global iron ore imports in 2019, with a 69.1% share of total global imports.

## Iron ore in nigeria mining locattion - Simurgh Industrial and Mining 
Iron ore is a metal element and covers about 5% of the earth's crust. By extracting raw iron ore from iron mines, a dark silver-brown powder is obtained. iron ore in nigeria is one of the best ores in the world and it is obtained from various location of coal in nigeria. Iron metal is extracted from iron ore by a chemical operation.
