## Gypsum Recycling - FEECO International Inc.
Gypsum is an exceptional material in that it is endlessly recyclable, meaning it can be continuously recycled to make the same product. Gypsum board recycling typically begins when construction site waste is brought to a recycling center for processing. The recycling center separates the paper from the gypsum and breaks down the gypsum into a

Gypsum used for plaster manufacture usually contains at least 90% CaSO 4 2H 2 O, a maximum of 0.02% NaCl (salt), and approximately 2% acid insolubles. Another major use of gypsum is in the cement industry, where it is added at the rate of 2-5% to cement clinker prior to final grinding to retard the setting rate of concrete.

One such mineral with great industry use and but largely underdeveloped in Nigeria, is gypsum. About one billion tones of gypsum deposits are spread over many sites in Nigeria. It is an important input for the production of cement. It is also used for the production of Plaster of Paris (P0P) and classroom chalk, etc.
