A DC machine is an electromechanical energy alteration device. The working principle of a DC machine is when electric current flows through a coil within a magnetic field, and then the magnetic force generates a torque that rotates the dc motor. The DC machines are classified into two types such as DC generator as well as DC motor.

## DC Motor Working Principle, Construction and Diagram Explanation
The DC motor working principle is that a current-carrying conductor experiences a mechanical force when placed in a magnetic field. This is known as the Lorentz force. And the direction of this force is given by FLEMING'S LEFT-HAND RULE. DC motor working principle is similar to the working principle of a DC generator.
