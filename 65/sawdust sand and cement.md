Nowadays, sawdust has been widely regarded as a sand replacement material to produce sawdust concrete. This thesis uses orthogonal test to analyze the mechanical and heat preservation as well as heat insulation property with the sawdust replacement ratio of 0%, 3%, 5%, 7%, 10%, respectively, to get an optimal sawdust replacement ratio.
