4.1.1 Hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3) Iron is the 4th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and it exists mostly as an oxide because it is easily oxidized in air. Iron has 16 oxides and among these, hematite is the oldest known. Hematite is a red-brown solid that is extremely stable under ambient conditions.
