## Stone Wool - Density - Heat Capacity - Material Properties
Thermal conductivity of Stone Wool is 0.03 W/ (m·K). The heat transfer characteristics of a solid material are measured by a property called the thermal conductivity, k (or λ), measured in W/m.K. It is a measure of a substance's ability to transfer heat through a material by conduction. Note that Fourier's law applies for all matter
