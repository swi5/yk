## Mechanical Cross-Sectioning — Sample Preparation
The initial step in preparing a sample for metallographic micro structural analysis is to locate the area of interest. Cutting (also known as sectioning) is the most common technique for getting close to this area of interest. Good cutting guarantees minimal micro structural damage. We should avoid damage like graphite flakes, nodules or grain

## Stamp mill
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps, loosely held vertically in a frame, in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp, the stamp falls onto the ore below, crushing the rock, and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.

## Eight tips for effective grinding - The Fabricator
The act of grinding can be deceivingly simple. But the devil's in the details. Effective grinding requires operators to apply enough pressure at the correct angle to let the grains—the "cutting tool" of a grinding disc—remove the most metal in the shortest time, while not prematurely wearing the disc or burning out the grinding tool.
