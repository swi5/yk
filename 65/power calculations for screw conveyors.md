Thus TSHP is calculated as follows: TSHP = 0.256 + 1.320 = 1.576 H.P. Assuming a drive efficiency of 85% resulting in a total drive horsepower of 1.853, a standard 2 horsepower motor would be selected for the drive input. The horsepower required for the above conveyor may also be determined graphically by the use of the two horsepower nomographs.

## calculation of power requirement for screw conveyor
Calculating Power required to drive a conveyor. From your 3000Tonnes per hour and a given length of conveyor belt you can work out the power required to shift that amount from : (3000/3600)2m  9.81 = 16.35kw I have assumed the 2m is conveyor length, as a length is not given, you then need to add the power to turn the conveyor and gearbox at correct speeds which will of course be dictated by
