In Indonesia, coal has long been exploited to satisfy the avarice of those in power. Prior to the country's independence, in 1861, the Dutch colonial government began mining coal in Palaran, East Kalimantan, before kicking off production in Ombilin, West Sumatra, in 1892. In fact, Kalimantan and Sumatra islands are Indonesia's 'supermarket' of coal. As of 2020, coal reserves on the two islands

Indonesia has significant coal and mineral deposits, with the majority of Indonesia's mining exports being thermal coal. Indonesia's close proximity to the large energy-consumption nations of China, India, Japan and Korea, coupled with low-cost production, have resulted in Indonesia being ranked as one of the world's largest exporters of thermal coal.
