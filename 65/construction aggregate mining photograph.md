The gravel-pack sand size is determined by multiplying the median formation grain size by 6.This value is the median gravel grain size. With a straight edge, construct the gravel curve so that its uniformity coefficient, C μ, is 1.5. The actual gravel size can be determined by the intercept of gravel curve with the 0 and 100 percentile values. Beautiful Bulldozer Equipment Moving Gravel Hard
