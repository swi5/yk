The temperatures we need to roast ore are fairly low, typically between 300 to 550 °C or so - enough to boil off the water and trigger our chemical reactions, but that's it. We can accomplish that by setting a pile of dry wood within a brick kiln, putting the iron ore on top of them, and lighting the whole thing on fire.
