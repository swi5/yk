## carbon regeneration in gold processing cic
The extraction process can employ carbon as part of the gold recovery operation for various circuit designs including carbon-in-pulp (CIP), carbon-in-column (CIC), and carbon-in-leach (CIL) circuits.Highlights Worldwide gold recovery on activated carbon grew from zero to almost 70 in twenty years from 1980.

## Gold CIL & CIP Gold Leaching Process Explained CCD
Cyanide is a lixiviant, or reagent that is used to leach, often in tanks, gold from a solid matrix and form a gold cyanide complex. The gold cyanide complex is then extracted from the pulp or slurry by adsorption onto activated carbon. CIL stands for carbon-in-leach. This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to

Water is then added to the process to create a mud-like slurry that is pumped into a thickener where gold-bearing particles sink to the bottom and are passed to downstream processing. Typically, the next processing phase is a CIL, CIP or CIC circuit. All these methods use cyanide and activated carbon to extract the gold from the slurry.
