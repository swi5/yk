## Grinding Machine-Parts, Functions, and Types
Jul 12, 2022A grinding wheel and a regulating wheel are used to move the job. The grinder consists of four parts: work rest, regulating wheel, grinding wheel, and a guide. Because of the grinding wheel's pressure, Jobs keeps his hand on the work rest blade. The regulating wheel ensures that the job is spinning at the same speed.

## Difference Between Machining and Grinding
Grinding. Machining is one bulk material removal process (i.e. high MRR). Thus it is economical and suitable to give proper size and also for semi-finishing. Grinding has low material removal rate and is preferred only for finishing. Accuracy and tolerance achieved by conventional machining operations are not so good.

A grinding is metal cutting operation which is performed by means of a rotating abrasive wheel that acts as a tool. These are mostly used to finish workpieces which must show a high surface quality, accuracy of shape and dimension. Mostly, it is finishing operation because it removes material in very small size of chips 0.25 - 0.5 mm.

Types and Uses of a Grinding Machine. Posted on October 19, 2012 by Yash Shah. The grinding machine is a type of tool that is utilized for grinding work pieces. It basically use an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool. The rough surface of the abrasive wheel shreds off small portions of the work piece as required. It is also known as a grinder.
