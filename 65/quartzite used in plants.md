Not only does this make for a tough stone, but it also makes it easy to tell quartzite from the imposters. Quartz is 7 on Mohs hardness scale. That means it's harder than glass and harder than a knife blade. These things are easy to test with a sample of stone. If a rock that is labeled as quartzite is soft, then it was mislabeled.
