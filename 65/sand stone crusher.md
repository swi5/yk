The Sandstorm is a grinder found west of the quarry, operated by Drew, which grinds sandstone into buckets of sand.. To use this machine, players must deposit empty buckets (notes are accepted) with Drew, and must load the machine with sandstone, with heavier pieces of sandstone resulting in more buckets being filled with sand. They can then claim noted buckets of sand from Drew for 50 coins each.
