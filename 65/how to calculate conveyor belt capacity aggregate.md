## Conveyor belt design
The clean, smooth steering surface improves the efficiency and durability of conveyor belts . The working surface of the mobile pulley must not be too smooth or too rough (the surface must not be wrinkled!), As this can cause excessive belt wear, noise and premature belt failure. It is recommended to make a work surface with a roughness Ra = 1.

## Calculating Conveying Capacities- Need to Know for All Plant Owners
Calculate the volume of the box (length x width x height) and take your product weight divided by this answer. The result will be density, which may need to be converted to more reasonable units such as pounds/cubic feet or kg/cubic meter. Now that we have capacity and density, we can calculate a rate per hour.
