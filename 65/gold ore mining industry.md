## Gold Ore Resources Status and Annual Production of Countries by  - FTM
Preface: The gold ore resource on the earth is scarce and unevenly distributed. The 80 or so gold producing countries have different levels of gold mining and production. This article sorts out the resource status and production status of gold ore in each continent except Antarctica and summarizes the potential of regional gold ore mining by analyzing the policies and other factors in each region.

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.
