## Host Rock - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The host rock is dacite-quartz-feldspar porphyry intruded into volcanic andesite, andesite breccia, conglomerate, sandstone, and tuff. The basement rocks are granite, schist, and gneiss. The length and width of surface alteration over the deposit are 2.5 and 1.75 km, respectively, with an overall surface coverage of 3.4 sq. km.

Ores are obtained by mining. You can mine by buying a Pickaxe and using it on an Ore node. You will obtain your ore when the damage bar at the top hits 100%, at which point it will be deposited into your inventory. If your inventory is full, the ore will drop to the ground instead. Ore nodes have a chance to drop Gems in the place of their ores

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
The barren rock, or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore. By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper, iron and sometimes other metals. Such ores originate from sulfur-bearing volcanic magmas, which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.

How Copper is Mined. Copper is found alongside many other types of ore. It can be found near gold, silver, zinc, lead, and other types of metal deposits. When mixed in with other ores, copper is not usually found in great abundance. Until the development of the modern copper mining process, it was typically a byproduct of mining for other metals.

It is most abundant in the Tundra or Ice biomes, especially 20-30 blocks below the surface. Copper Ore is clearly distinguishable from the surrounding rock due to its reddish, mottled appearance.

## copper processing - Ores | Britannica
Principal forms in which copper ores are found include native copper, porphyry copper, massive deposits, and mixed ores. Native copper is simply the metal found unadulterated in nature. Occasionally copper is still found in its native form, but more frequently it is mixed with other minerals, some of which may have value themselves. The amount of copper in an ore can vary from 0.4 percent to

## Copper - Mineral
Secondary ores, called oxide ores, formed as weather and other natural forces altered ancient rocks. Both types of ore are mined and processed to extract the copper. Primary ore minerals of copper include malachite, azurite, chalcocite, bornite, and cuprite. One of the more familiar and beautiful minor ore minerals of copper is chrysocolla.

Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm.

On passing the ore via an upward stream of water, the lighter gangue particles are separated from the heavier metal ore. This is a gravity separation method. This process is used to enrich ores that are heavier than the gangue particles that are present in them. A stream of water is run through crushed and finely powdered ore in this procedure.

Metals Found in Rocks. Metals from rocks Some metals are held inside rocks as minerals The rock or mineral that holds the metal is called an ore An ore is heated with chemicals until it melts and the pure metal separates out as a liquid The liquid then cools and hardens A few metals such as gold silver and copper can be found in pure form as metal elements
