## The pros and cons of cone crusher applications - Quarry
A cone crusher in a secondary crushing application will typically work with a 3.5:1 to 5:1 reduction ratio. Tertiary cone crusher configurations typically work with a reduction ratio of 2.5:1 to 4:1. The reduction ratio is defined as the ratio of the feed size for which 80 per cent will pass (F80), divided by the product size for which 80 per

## Cone Crusher | Working Principle | Animation | Engineering Intro
Cone crusher and gyratory crusher work on the same principle. Both have the same operation. If cone crusher differs then it is only from crushing chamber. Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones. It breaks the rocks by squeezing it between the gyrating spindles.

## How does gyratory crusher work?s
How does a gyratory cone crusher work? Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h.
