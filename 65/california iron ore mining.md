## How is Iron Ore Mined
Most of the iron ore produced in the world is extracted from the earth's crust through opencast mining. This involves removing the overburden by making use of explosives to expose the bedrock containing iron ore. Mining of iron ore can be manual or it can be mechanized depending upon the size of the mine and the reserves of iron ore to be

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Iron ore extraction techniques - ScienceDirect
Iron ore was won by drilling and blasting ().As mining technology generally developed, so did drilling techniques and the explosives used. Smith (1990) reported that the Cleveland deposit was associated with a very strong stone roof rock (known as "dogger") allowing mine drivages to be self-supporting. However, he states that in later years where the mining had progressed to the dip, this

## Iron Ore | Geoscience Australia
In 2018, Australia's EDR of iron ore increased by 3% from 2017 to 49 604 Mt (Table 3). Similarly, there was a 4% EDR increase of contained iron to 24 122 Mt (Table 4). EDR attributable to magnetite deposits have decreased by 1%, likely due to re-assessment of projects and inactivity in the magnetite industry.

## Iron ore | BHP
With 5 mines, 4 processing hubs and 2 port facilities, our Pilbara iron ore business is all connected by more than 1,000 kilometres of rail infrastructure. At each mining hub ore from the mines is crushed, beneficiated (where necessary) and blended to create high-grade hematite lump and fines products.
