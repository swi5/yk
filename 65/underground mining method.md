Two main methods of underground mining are practiced in Pennsylvania: Room-and-Pillar: Generally used for seams that are relatively flat or gently dipping. As the 'room' is mined, large 'pillars' of coal are left behind to support the weight of the overburden and rock layers above. This type of mining is the traditional method of underground

## What Is Underground Mining Method - Mining World
What Is Underground Mining Method. Underground mining is used to extract ore from underneath the floor of the earth safely, economically, and with as little waste as possible. The access from the floor to an underground mine can be thru a horizontal or vertical tunnel, referred to as an adit, shaft, or wane.

Once a decision has been made to go underground, the specific mining method selected depends on the size, shape, and orientation of the ore body, the grade of mineralization, the strength of the rock materials, and the depths involved. For example, if the ore is very high grade or carries a high price, then a higher cost method can be used.

One of the most important aspects of underground hard rock mining is ventilation.Ventilation is the primary method of clearing hazardous gases and/or dust which are created from drilling and blasting activity (e.g., silica dust, NOx), diesel equipment (e.g., diesel particulate, carbon monoxide), or to protect against gases that are naturally emanating from the rock (e.g., radon gas).

The underground mining methods we use include room and pillar, narrow vein stoping and large-scale mechanised mining. Room and pillar mining is a style of mining where tunnels are driven in a chess board pattern with massive square pillars between them which are gradually cut away as the work proceeds. We use this for mining coal.

There are five basic types of surface mining, including open-pit mining, strip mining, dredging, mountaintop removal, and high wall mining. All of these methods remove the waste material or the overburden, which is above the desired resource. Often, surface mining is preferred over underground mining, or subsurface mining, for numerous reasons.

## What Is Underground Mining? - Groff Engineering & Consulting PLLC
Underground mining is a distinct segment of the mining sector. Underground mining is generally used to extract minerals that are too far underground for surface mining to be economical. There are many different underground mining methods that can be implemented, depending on the mineral being mined and the nature of the deposit.

## Underground soft-rock mining
Underground soft-rock mining is a group of underground mining techniques used to extract coal, oil shale, potash, and other minerals or geological materials from sedimentary ("soft") rocks. Because deposits in sedimentary rocks are commonly layered and relatively less hard, the mining methods used differ from those used to mine deposits in igneous or metamorphic rocks (see underground hard
