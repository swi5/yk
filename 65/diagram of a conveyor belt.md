A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems.A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with a closed loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt

Conveyor Belt Controller Circuit Connections & Operation. Connections: - as shown in circuit tab 1 two ports of 89C2051 P1 & P3 controls entire system. Pins P1.0, P1.1, P1.2 are connected to fwd, stop and drop controls through buffers 7407. P1.5, P1.6 & P1.7 drives 3 LEDs as shown. So P1 is completely output port.

## How Do Conveyor Belts Work? | Belt Functions, Uses & Applications - SEMCOR
A conveyor belt works by using two motorized pulleys that loop over a long stretch of thick, durable material. When motors in the pulleys operate at the same speed and spin in the same direction, the belt moves between the two. If objects are particularly heavy or bulky — or if the conveyor belt is carrying them for a long distance or
