## 6 key considerations for conveyor selection - Processing Magazine
One of the most frequently occurring mistakes with conveyor or feeder sizing comes from confusing material usage with instantaneous demand. For example, while a process may consume 1,000 pounds per hour of material, the conveyor or feeder may need to deliver at a rate that is 12 times higher if the batch needs to be satisfied in five minutes.

## Conveyor belt design
The clean, smooth steering surface improves the efficiency and durability of conveyor belts . The working surface of the mobile pulley must not be too smooth or too rough (the surface must not be wrinkled!), As this can cause excessive belt wear, noise and premature belt failure. It is recommended to make a work surface with a roughness Ra = 1.

## 3 Considerations in Selecting the Right Conveyor for Turns
Preventing delays and product damage are the biggest considerations, and the right conveyor will avoid these. To choose the correct turn conveyor, you must account for the product being handled, the assembly environment, the level of sanitation, and your throughput goals. With that in mind, the conveyor selection guide is an excellent place to

## Conveyor Systems Types, Specifications and Selection
Slat Belt Conveyor. Slat conveyors are a type of conveying technology that uses a chain-driven loop of slats to move product from one of its ends to another. A motor drives the chain, which causes it to cycle just as belt conveyors do. Instead of a rubber belt, this conveyor type uses slats connected to a chain, providing a rigid, flat surface for every item on the conveyor.

## Conveyors - Capacities - Engineering ToolBox
Typical Conveyor Capacity. 1 in = 25.4 mm. 1 ft3/h = 0.028 m3/h. 1 ft/min = 5.08 x 10-3 m/s.
