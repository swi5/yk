## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3‚ÅÑ4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3‚ÅÑ4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.

## Crushed Concrete Aggregate - Recycling Concrete to Make Newer "Green 
Crushed concrete aggregate (CCA) is made from unused, returned concrete, and old demolished concrete that is clean enough to be used for new concrete mixes. Crushing old concrete to make aggregate for new concrete is growing in popularity for many reasons the with first being able to create a more sustainable or "green" concrete.
