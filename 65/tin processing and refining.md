The Process The tin-smelting operation is divided into two cycles as shown in the flow diagram of Fig. 2.

## [Solved] Tin and lead can be refined by - Testbook
Detailed Solution. Tin and lead can be refined by Liquation. It is a refining process for separating metals from an ore or alloy . In this process, the impurities are separated by melting the ore of the metals at a high point. It is a refining process in metallurgy where ores or alloyed metals are melted very high temperatures .

The main disadvantages of pyrometallurgical refining are thus the multi-stage processing, low efficiency and the high prime costs. On the other hand, electrolytic refining in aqueous media can achieve efficient purification in one step.
