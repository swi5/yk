## Tips on Reducing The Impact of Gold Mining And Processing
As it stands, traditional methods of mining gold releases huge swathes of toxic waste and ravages the landscape. In many poorer parts of the world, miners easily get away with using illegal means of obtaining gold. The worst of such practices is the use of cyanide in mining operations. This toxic chemical is used to process gold because it

2. Gravity Separation (Amalgamation)-Cyanidation Leaching Combined Method. This kind of gold processing method is suitable for the gold-containing oxidized ore of quartz vein type with uneven grain size and deep oxidation. The kind of ore should be basically free of elements such as copper, arsenic and antimony.

At current gold prices this is worth about US$600. Both smelter treatment charges and oxidation or bio-leach costs are at least $200/t of concentrate and payables/recovery in the 90% range, so a minimum GSR for effective downstream processing is around 0.5. Clearly this is a function of gold price, but in the current gold price and cost

The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.
