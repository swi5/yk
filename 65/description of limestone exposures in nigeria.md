## limestone | Characteristics, Formation, Texture, Uses, & Facts
limestone, sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), usually in the form of calcite or aragonite. It may contain considerable amounts of magnesium carbonate (dolomite) as well; minor constituents also commonly present include clay, iron carbonate, feldspar, pyrite, and quartz. Most limestones have a granular texture. Their constituent grains range in size from 0.001 mm (0.

## Geology and Occurrences of Limestone and Marble in Nigeria | Fatoye 
Limestone occurs only in the sedimentary basins in Nigeria. It occurs mainly in the Benue Trough (Lower, Middle and Upper), Sokoto, Dahomey and Borno (Chad) Basins. Limestone-forming environments (shallow coastal marine conditions), appear to have occurred several times in the geological history of the basins.

## Limestone
Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium

## Limestone - Infogalactic: the planetary knowledge core
Most limestone is composed of skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, forams and molluscs. Limestone makes up about 10% of the total volume of all sedimentary rocks. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years.
