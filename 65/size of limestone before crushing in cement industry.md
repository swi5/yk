## How Cement Is Made
The most common way to manufacture portland cement is through a dry method. The first step is to quarry the principal raw materials, mainly limestone, clay, and other materials. After quarrying the rock is crushed. This involves several stages. The first crushing reduces the rock to a maximum size of about 6 inches.

## Cement Kilns: Size Reduction and Grinding
Rawmill systems typically require a feed of maximum size 5-10 cm, so a crushing stage is first required. In the kiln, the finely-divided rawmix is sintered, resulting in production of hard clinker of typical size 1-50 mm. In order to produce cement, this has to be ground, again to a powder of maximum size about 100 μm.
