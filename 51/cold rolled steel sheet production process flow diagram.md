## Brief Overview of Cold Rolled Coil and Production
The cold rolled coil is made of hot rolled coil. In cold rolled process, the hot rolled coil is rolled below the recrystallization temperature, and the generally rolled steel is rolled at room temperature. Steel sheet with high silicon content has low brittleness and low plasticity, and needs to be preheated to 200 Â°C before cold rolling.

## Rolling Process for Steel - IspatGuru
Rolling is the process of plastically deforming steel by passing it between rolls. Rolling is defined as the reduction of the cross sectional area of the steel piece being rolled, or the general shaping of the steel products, through the use of the rotating rolls. Rolling of steel is one of the most important manufacturing processes for steel.

## Manufacturing Process - TCRSS
Cold rolling causes steel to become hard and brittle. To obtain the desired microstructure and improve mechanical properties, the cold rolled strip is annealed at the suitable temperatures. TCRSS employs 100% Hydrogen atmosphere annealing facilities. Coils can achieve homogeneous qualities and higher production rate due to higher heat transfer.

## Rolling of Metals: Process and Principles (With Diagram)
The rolling process is shown in Fig. 2.1: Rolling is done both hot and cold. It is accomplishes in rolling mills. A rolling mill is a complex machine having two or more working rollers, supporting rollers, roll stands, drive motor, reducing gear, flywheel, coupling gear etc. Rollers may be plain or grooved depends upon the shape of rolled product.

## Cold Rolled Steel Sheet Manufacturing Process
In comparison a cold rolled steel product with the same chemical composition has a yield strength of 365 mpa. Thus the yield strength of cold rolled steel is higher than that of hot rolled steel. Cold rolling is a process by which the sheet metal or strip stock is introduced between rollers and then compressed and squeezed.
