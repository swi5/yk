## Understanding Conveyor Systems - Types, Applications and  - Thomasnet
Belt Conveyors are material handling systems that use continuous belts to convey products or material. The belt is extended in an endless loop between two end-pulleys. Usually, one or both ends have a roll underneath.

## Conveyor belt system: structure and 3 common types
Mar 26, 2021The conveyor belt system's standard structure has three layers: a top cover, carcass, and bottom cover. However, some applications require multiple layers of the conveyor belt. The layers of the belt depending on the products that you want to move. Steel, aramid, polyester, nylon, and cotton are some most common carcass layer's materials.

## Design of Belt conveyor system - SlideShare
The diameter of the pulley must be designed such that it does not place undue stress on the belt. The length of a belt conveyor in metres is the length from the centre of pulley parallel to belt line. Belt length is dependent on both the pulley diameters and centre distances. Capacity is the product of speed and belt cross sectional area.

## Belt conveyor frame types and design considerations
The Belt conveyor frame is a metal structure (usually using normal and stainless steel conveyor frame) used to support idlers, pulley and belt tension. The designed structure and production material of the frame determine the quality of the frame. The actual use of the belt conveyor frames involve various forms of steel structure.
