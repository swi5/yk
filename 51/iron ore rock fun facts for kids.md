## Iron ore Facts for Kids | KidzSearch
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. Iron (Fe) is one of the most abundant rock-forming elements. It makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust. It is the second most abundant and widely distributed metal (Aluminium is the most common). People have used it for more than 3,000 years.

## pyrite | Properties & Facts | Britannica
pyrite, also called iron pyrite or fool's gold, a naturally occurring iron disulfide mineral. The name comes from the Greek word pyr, "fire," because pyrite emits sparks when struck by metal. Pyrite is called fool's gold; to the novice its colour is deceptively similar to that of a gold nugget. Nodules of pyrite have been found in prehistoric burial mounds, which suggests their use as

## ore - Students | Britannica Kids | Homework Help
Iron ore should contain about 30 percent iron if it is to be mined profitably. Gold ores containing as little as 0.044 ounce (1.25 grams) of gold per ton can be mined at a profit. Magnesium can be removed from sea water at a profit by special methods. Gold, though present in sea water, cannot yet be extracted profitably.
