Scientific literature from around the world has identified both immediate and long-term risks associated with sand and gravel mining. These risks underscore the need for tighter regulation of the sand mining industry in Texas, where the industry does not follow best practices commonly accepted in other states and countries. Yet some miners here are pushing to start mining rivers (as opposed to

Worldwide, more sand and gravel is mined annually than any other industrial raw material. Preliminary estimates of sand and gravel production in Arkansas for 2007 by the U.S. Geological Survey are nearly 9.1 million metric tons valued at $66,300,000. Nearly fifty percent was used for concrete aggregate and concrete products.

Sand is the most mined substance in the world, with a significant amount of illegal mining activity from "sand mafias". Image credit: Wikimedia Commons. Sand is the single most mined commodity, eclipsing minerals and metals by a colossal margin. Around 85% of the material we pull up from the earth is sand, gravel or other aggregate materials.
