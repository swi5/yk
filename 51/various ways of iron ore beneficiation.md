## Beneficiation of iron ore - Kennecott Corporation
Beneficiation of iron ore . United States Patent . Abstract: Isostearic acid, a liquid isomer of stearic acid, is used as an agent in a froth flotation process to concentrate the iron oxide in iron ores. By use of this flotation agent, the iron oxide in the ground ore is directly floated away from the remainder of the ore.

The directions of the aggregate of magnetite and sulphide in these two processes are different. In the former process, the aggregate mainly enters the

## Iron Ore | Geoscience Australia
In 2018, Australia's EDR of iron ore increased by 3% from 2017 to 49 604 Mt (Table 3). Similarly, there was a 4% EDR increase of contained iron to 24 122 Mt (Table 4). EDR attributable to magnetite deposits have decreased by 1%, likely due to re-assessment of projects and inactivity in the magnetite industry.
