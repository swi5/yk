## Jaw Crusher - JXSC Mineral
A jaw crusher is a compression type crusher, usually used as a primary crusher set at the very front of the ore or rock crushing plant to reduce hard rock size. Jaw rock crushers are commonly double-toggle jaw crushers, composed of a fixed jaw and moving jaw, the discharging stone particle size can be controlled by changing the discharge port.

## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
How Jaw Crushers Work A jaw crusher uses compressive force for breaking ore pieces. Compressive force is applied by two jaws ( dies ), one of the crusher jaws is stationary ( fixed jaw) whilst the other is moving ( swing jaw ). Material is fed into the top feed opening (gape) and gradually moves downwards towards the lower discharge outlet.
