## (PDF) Asia's Energy Challenge | Donghyun Park
Asia must be at the center of the global fight against climate change. It is the world's most populous region, with high economic growth, a rising share of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the most vulnerability to climate risks. Its current resource- and emission-intensive growth pattern is not sustainable.

The operations which are considered for calculation of fugitive dust from a coal-fired power plant or a transshipment terminal include: coal delivery, coal transfer, sampling, crushing, and storage. The estimation of fugitive dust emissions for proposed coal-handling facilities is accomplished through application of published emission factors.

Describing and eliminating the health hazards of coal processing requires an understanding of the nature of the raw materials, products, by-products, the type of pollutants produced, the design of the plant and its operating methods (Wadden, 1976).The structure of coal was described in Chapter 6 and is thought to be a highly linked amorphous polymer consisting of aggregates connected by

1. The fugitive emissions are HAPs. OR 2. Your facility is one of those source categories listed in Table 2-1, in which case you will need to include the quantifiable fugitive emissions of all other regulated air pollutants (e.g., particulate matter, VOCs). OR 3. Your facility is subject to a NSPS or NESHAP promulgated before August 7, 1980.
