Crushed aggregate, also known as rock aggregate, refers to a crushed stone product produced in quarries. In areas where natural sand and gravel aggregate deposits are insufficient to handle local demand, larger stones are processed in an impact crusher to create crushed rock aggregate. All aggregate is divided into two types: fine and coarse.
