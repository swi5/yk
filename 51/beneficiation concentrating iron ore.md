Sep 7, 2022However, if the physical beneficiation method (gravity separation, strong magnetic separation, flotation) is adopted, it is difficult for the grade of iron ore concentrate to reach more than 45%. If the roasting method is used, the grade of iron concentrate can be greatly improved, but some useful minerals will be lost during the roasting process.

The iron concentrate is balled in drums and heated to create a hardened agglomerate. Agglomerates may be in the form of pellets, sinter, briquettes, or nodules. The purpose of agglomerating iron ore is to improve the permeability of blast furnace feed leading to faster gas-solid contact in the furnace (Weiss 1985).

## Sources of ironse-zingst
Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Beneficiation of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material. Grade of iron ore is usually determined by the total
