## length to diameter ratios rod mill
The length-to-inside diameter ratio of a rod mill was 1.5 when the length was 4.72 m. The true densities of the grinding media and the ore were 8.0 and 2.35 t/m 3, respectively. Forty percent of the mill volume was filled with grinding rods.

## length to diameter ratios rod mill
Length To Diameter Ratios Rod Mill. Length to diameter ratios rod mill lebistrottreflefr. rod mills are less common than ball mills for grinding minerals the rods used in the mill, usually a highcarbon steel, can vary in both the length and the diameter as fine as 300μm, reduction ratios normally being in the range 15:1 to 20:1 the distinctive feature of a rod mill is that the.

## length diameter ratio for ball mill
The ratio of cylinder length to diameter of rod mill is generally 1.5-2.0, and the inner surface of liner plate on end cover is vertical plane. In most cases, the ratio of the length to the diameter of the ball mill is only slightly greater than 1.
