## Origin of cementing calcite in "carbonatite" tuffs - NASA/ADS
Many tuffs contain crystal, glass, and rock fragments that are supported by calcite cement, and some of these have recently been classified as carbonatites, i.e., igneous rocks dominated by magmatic carbonate minerals. In samples studied here, the cementing calcite has lower Sr and higher Mg concentrations, and higher 18 O/ 16 O but lower 13 C
