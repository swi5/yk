## High-performance Concrete - New Systems For Concrete Countertops
Ductal is a cementitious composite material with ultra-high strength â€” up to 30,000 psi. The material was developed to deliver structural performance without metal reinforcement. Not a traditional concrete, Ductal has no coarse aggregate. Plasticizer and reinforcing fibers (PVA or metallic) are included.

High-Performance Bedding (HPB) consists of limestone chips. You can easily use it for many DIY projects. It is 1/4" clear stone with no fines and contains only pea-size pieces of limestone. HPB looks similar to limestone screenings but has been washed clean, and it makes a whole lot of difference. Limestone screenings wick the water away

## How to Improve the Concrete Pumping Performance of High-Rise Buildings
1, The high viscosity of high-strength concrete results in poor fluidity and cannot meet the pumping requirements of super high-rise buildings, so it is easy to cause pipe blockage. 2, When the fluidity of concrete is too large, its anti-segregation and bleeding ability will decrease. Under the action of pump pressure, the segregation of
