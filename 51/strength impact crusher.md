## The difference between strength and toughness - Industrial Metallurgists
Fracture toughness is a measure of the energy required to fracture a material that contains a crack. As a metal's yield strength increases, the amount of stress the metal can support without deforming increases. Alternatively, as yield strength increases, a smaller cross-section of metal is required to support a given load without deforming.
