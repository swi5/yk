Workers using heavy machinery drill the rock from deep tunnels with heavy machinery or blast it with dynamite, leaving the ore in pieces. Then they shovel the ore onto loaders and trucks, and haul it to a shaft.

## Lead Mining - Concentration process, flotation, filtering, roasting 
Mining the ore : The first step requires the lead ore to be mined from the grounds. Heavy machinery is used to drill the rocks from deep tunnels or blast it with dynamite, breaking the ore into pieces. The ore is then shoveled onto loaders and trucks and hauled to a shaft. The miners dump the ore down the shaft, and from there it is hoisted to

## :: WorstPolluted : Projects Reports
Primary lead is mined, separated from ore, and refined into various products, whereas secondary lead is recovered from used objects - such as used lead-acid batteries - for reuse in other products. Smelting is a key process in lead product production, and involves heating lead ore or recovered lead with chemical reducing agents.
