##  Lime Production: Industry Profile - US EPA
Limestone can be categorized as either high calcium or dolomitic. Pure high-calcium limestone is 100 percent calcium carbonate (100 percent calcite or aragonite). Generally, limestone of this purity does not occur naturally. High-quality, high-calcium limestone would actually contain 97 to 99 percent calcium carbonate and 1 to 3 percent impurities.

Calcination of CaCO3 is a highly endothermic reaction, requiring around 755 Mcal of heat input to produce a ton of lime (CaO). The reaction only begins when the temperature is above the dissociation temperature of the carbonates in the limestone. This typically is between 780 deg C and 1340 deg C.

## The Origin of Limestone - In the Beginning: Compelling Evidence for 
Limestone, sometimes called calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ), is difficult to identify by sight, but is quickly identified by the "acid test." If a drop of any acid, such as vinegar, is placed on limestone or a rock containing limestone, it will fizz. The acid combines with the limestone to release fizzing bubbles of CO 2 gas.

However, the chalk used on chalkboards today is being replaced by gypsum (calcium sul-fate, CaSO 4). Limestone is still used in AgLime and Lime, Portland Cement, and as stone used in

## CAC - Production of low sulfur content lime from limestone 
A process for calcining limestone to lime to produce a low sulfur content lime product, while combusting a sulfur-containing carbonaceous fuel in a rotary kiln to provide heat for the calcination. A finely divided lime hydrate is added to the rotary kiln adjacent the combustion flame, such that the lime hydrate particles react with sulfur-containing contaminants in the hot combustion gases to
