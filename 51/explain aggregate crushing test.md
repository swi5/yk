5. Size and Shape. The size of aggregates less than 4.75mm is called fine aggregate and beyond 4.75mm is called coarse aggregates. The size and shape of the aggregates impact the strength and durability of the concrete. The workability of concrete might be affected when using large size aggregates.

There are a variety of parent rocks with compressive strengths ranging from 45MPa to 545Mpa.An aggregate sample's crushing value is determined by applying a gradually increasing compressive load to it. Test participants are typically required to pass 12.5 mm of aggregate and retain it on a 10mm sieve.
