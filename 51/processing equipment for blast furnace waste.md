The best process led to an optimized iron recovery of 78.5 % corresponding to an elemental iron content of 51 %, close to the ore grade required in a blast furnace. At the global scale of ELV recycling, these results entail an increase by 4 % of the fluff recycling rate, thus helping to meet the European requirements for 2015.

When you replace the fuel pump on your furnace, the entire fuel line system will need to be bled afterwards. The old pump will be disconnected from the furnace, and the input and output fuel lines will be removed. Then, those lines will be connected to the new fuel pump, and the pump will be attached to the furnace.

## Blast furnace
A blast furnace is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to produce industrial metals, generally pig iron, but also others such as lead or copper. Blast refers to the combustion air being "forced" or supplied above atmospheric pressure.. In a blast furnace, fuel (), ores, and flux are continuously supplied through the top of the furnace, while a hot blast of air (sometimes with

Stoves. The hot blast air is produced by passing cold blast air through preheated chambers or 'stoves', and heating the air to above 1000°C. The stove is first heated up by burning gas and combustion air within the chamber and allowing the heat to be absorbed into the brickwork, or 'chequerwork'. This mode is calledon-gas.
