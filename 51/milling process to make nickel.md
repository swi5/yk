This process is used to make smaller sizes of seamless pipe, typically 1 to 6 inches (25 to 150 mm) diameter. The ingot of steel is heated to 2,370 °F (1,300 °C) and pierced. A mandrel is inserted into the tube and the assembly is passed through a rolling (mandrel) mill. Unlike the plug mill, the mandrel mill reduces wall thickness.

## What is Milling?- Definition, Process, and Operations
Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece. This may be done in varying directions on one or several axes, cutter head speed, and pressure. The original class of machine tools for milling was the milling machine (often called a mill).

## Steel
Steel is an alloy made up of iron with typically a few tenths of a percent of carbon to improve its strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. Many other elements may be present or added. Stainless steels that are corrosion- and oxidation-resistant typically need an additional 11% chromium.Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, steel is used in buildings
