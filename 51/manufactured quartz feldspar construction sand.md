## Manmade quartz vs graniteall-held
Man-made quartz does not need sealing because of the way it is made. Quartzite, on the other hand, is less prone to scratching and can also withstand heat slightly better than quartz . When it comes to costs, quartzite is generally slightly more expensive than quartz because it needs to be cut into slabs to meet the specifications of each.

Answer (1 of 2): It comes down to the source of the sand grains, and to a variable degree, climate and time. In areas where quartz is scarce in the rock exposed to weathering, and especially where a cold climate slowed down the chemical weathering, the sand may be rich in feldspar. There are won

## Feldspar vs. Quartz: What's the Difference? 5 Crucial Signs
With feldspar and quartz, there is plenty of overlap between colors. Since they are both highly abundant crystals, there are plenty of variations. In many cases, though not always, feldspar is cloudy in appearance, while quartz is clear. If you held up a piece of quartz to a light source, the light would shine through.

## Feldspar vs Quartz: What Are They, And What's The Difference?
The difference is, that out of more than 200 recognized gemstones, at least 12 of those are variations of quartz, while only 4 of them are variations of feldspar. This is most likely due to the fact that quartz is a harder mineral than feldspar. If something can be scratched or broken more easily, it is considered less valuable.
