## Zinc Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Zinc ores normally contain 5-15% zinc. Approximately 80% of zinc mines are underground mined, 8% are mined from open pits, and the remainder are a combination of both ores ( Ray et al., 2014 ). Zinc concentrate, which contains approximately 55% zinc, is roasted at a temperature approximately 800°C (1472°F).
