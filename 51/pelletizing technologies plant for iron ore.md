## A new burner slashes NOx emissions from iron-ore pelletizing plants 
Before being fed to the blast furnace, iron ore is first converted into pellets by, for example, a traveling-grate (TG) pelletizing plant. In this plant, so-called green pellets are conveyed through a furnace that heats the pellets to high temperatures to perform drying, partial calcination and induration. The pelletizing process generates considerable emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) due

## AGICO Iron Ore Pellet Dryer - Cement Plant Machinery Supplier
In iron ore pelletizing plants, the iron ore dryer is one of the important pelletizing equipment. During the production process, the raw material (iron ore concentrate) moisture is generally between 11% - 15%. Before they are fed into the pelletizing disc, they should be dehydrated firstly. The main function of the dryer is to remove water

## Maximizing Iron Unit Yield from Ore to Liquid Steel (Part 1 - Ore 
Iron units represent the largest operating expense of a direct reduction plant, and metallic iron units represent the largest operating expense of an EAF steelmaking plant. Increasing or decreasing yield by a few percentage points can have a greater impact on total operating cost than a 50% swing in energy cost.
