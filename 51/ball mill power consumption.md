Nov 16, 2020The acceleration factor of the ball or rod mass is a function of the peripheral speed of the mill. Thus. n = c9np/√D, the above equation becomes P = f1 (D²)·f5 (πD c9 np/√D) = cs np D2.5. As a first approximation, the capacity, T, of a mill may be considered as a function of the force acting inside the mill.

## Power Consumption Of Ball Mill
Aug 01 2001 Typical power consumption for a 5-m diameter by 7-m-long ball mill is between 2.5 and 3.5 MW. The actual proportion of this energy usefully used in size reduction is thought to be very low perhaps in the range of 1-5. Significant financial and environmental benefits can be obtained by improving this efficiency even slightly.

The specific power consumption for these two ball shapes is shown in Fig. 16. For N≤75% there is no change in the mill power draw. This occurs because the center of mass of the charge is little changed by the particle shape at these speeds. At intermediate speeds, the power draw for the non-circular balls falls off rapidly.

Ball Mills. RSG Inc supplies dry ball mills in the range of 5 HP (3 Kw) to 5500 HP (4200 Kw). Dry ball mills are effective grinding systems in the general range of 500 microns down to 5 microns. Continuous milling systems are generally used in closed circuit with an air classifier. These ball mills are normally used in closed circuit milling in

## Ball Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Conical Ball Mills differ in mill body construction, which is composed of two cones and a short cylindrical part located between them  not least because the specific power consumption of vertical mills is about 30% less than that of ball mills and for finely ground cement less still. The vertical mill has a proven track record in grinding
