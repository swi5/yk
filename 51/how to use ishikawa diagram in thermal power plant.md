Normally in thermal power plants, forced draught is used at the entry of air from the atmosphere, and induced draught is used at the exit of flue gases from the system through the chimney.. Water Steam Circuit. The water-steam circuit of a thermal power generating plant is a semi-closed circuit. Here comparatively not much water is required to supply to the boiler from external sources since

The Ishikawa diagram should be expanded each time 5 Whys is used. For example, the branch may end up as: material → part not installed → employee skipped operation → work environment too dark → poor lighting → light bulbs burned out. In this example, the use of 5 Whys led to the true cause of the failure - the light bulbs burned out.
