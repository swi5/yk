## Adsorption of Iron(II) from Acid Mine Drainage  - SpringerLink
In this study, iron (Fe(II)) removal was tested in AMD samples collected from the Enugu Okpara abandoned coal mine (Nigeria), having iron concentrations of ∼1300 mg/l. Digestion, toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), and batch adsorption tests using coal bottom ash (BA), bentonite clay (BC), and coal fly ash (FA) were performed.
