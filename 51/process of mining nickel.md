## The Mineral Supply Chain Process for Essential Minerals
Nickel from lateritic ore is extracted through an extractive metallurgy process. This is done through a conventional roasting method which removes the moisture from the ore. Afterwards the nickel oxide is removed by using a reduction furnace which also greatly reduces the amount of chemical bound water. This results in a 75% pure form of nickel.

From 1953 to 1958 Nickel Rim mines operating around Sudbury, Ontario deposited their mine tailings in an impoundment near the mine. The water in the impoundment was later tested and found to have low pH and high concentrations of iron, sulphur and dissolved metals such as aluminum and nickel. This is due to the oxidation of the tailings (usually sulfide minerals like pyrrhotite).

## BioHeap - A Bioleaching Process for Nickel Extraction
Evaluation of the BioHeap Process. Establishment Costs. Summary. Background: Titan Resources, the Australian-based nickel producer, has recently confirmed the economics of its BioHeap process, following a pre-feasibihty cost analysis of the exploration of two small low-grade nickel sulphide deposits in northern Western Australia.

## Nickel Ore Mining Process | Equipment | Flow | Cases - JXSC
Nickel Ore Mining Process. Nickel ore mainly consists of copper-nickel sulfide ore and nickel oxide ore, beneficiation and processing of both methods is completely different. Copper-nickel sulfide ore beneficiation methods: The most important is the flotation. The magnetic and the gravity separation is usually secondary dressing method.
