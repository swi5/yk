## A reversibleradteileboerse
A reversible change changes how a substance looks or feels (changing the physical appearance), and it is easy to turn it back again. A reversible change may change the state of a substance such as, solid, liquid and gas. However, a reversible change does not change the amount of matter in a substance.. boiling water (water molecules are forced away from each other when the liquid changes to

## Dissolving Salt in Water: Chemical or Physical Change? - ThoughtCo
Why Dissolving Salt Is a Chemical Change. When you dissolve salt in water, the sodium chloride dissociates in Na + ions and Cl - ions, which may be written as a chemical equation : NaCl (s) → Na + (aq) + Cl - (aq) Therefore, dissolving salt in water is a chemical change. The reactant (sodium chloride, or NaCl) is different from the products

Physical Change. An example of a simple physical change is the freezing of water into ice, as it goes from a liquid to a solid state. No real change in chemistry has taken place during the freezing process, which is completely reversible. On the other hand, most chemical changes are not readily reversible.

## Physical Change: Meaning, Properties, Examples - Embibe
A change in which no new substances are formed can generally be reversed by reversing the conditions called a physical change. Q.5. How is a chemical change different from a physical change? Ans: During a physical change, the appearance or shape of matter changes, but the type of matter in the material does not. In contrast, a chemical change

## Melting of sugar physical or chemical
Explanation: The chemical reaction we are most familiar with is that of melting : sugar decomposes at a temperature ranging between 184 and 186°C. This is a very recent discovery we owe to a team of researchers in Illinois. Basically, when we heat sucrose gently, this produces a phenomenon known as " apparent melting ".
