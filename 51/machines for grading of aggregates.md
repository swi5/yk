## Coarse Aggregates in Construction - Characteristics and Uses
Coarse aggregates are generally obtained by blasting in stone quarries or by breaking them by hand or by crushers. Machine - crushed stones consist of stones of various sizes whereas Hand - broken aggregates consist of only single size stones. To produce graded aggregates for high-class concrete, they are again mixed in specific proportions.

## Aggregate: Factors Affecting the Grading of Aggregate | Concrete Technology
If the grading extends to a larger maximum aggregate size, the overall specific surface is reduced and the water requirement decreÂ­ases, but the relation is not linear. For example if the size of aggregate is increased from 10 mm to 63 mm, under certain conditions, the water/cement ratio can be decreased by 0.15.

## The Grading-selbsthilfegruppe
The Grading Bucket / Ditching Bucket is a wide, shallow bucket with a straight edge, designed for ground levelling and smoothing out aggregates and soil. Rhinox Grading Buckets have a reinforced leading edge to increase durability - this dramatically improves the wear resistance of the bucket.All buckets from the 3-ton and above can also be.
