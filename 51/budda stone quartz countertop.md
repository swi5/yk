## Quartz Countertop Brand Comparison - The Spruce
Aug 7, 2021Though most of the countertop is comprised of quartz, up to 15% of the countertop may be resin and color pigments. Like natural stone, quartz possesses a deep, rich appearance and a solid, rock-like feeling. Like solid surface, quartz has synthetic additives that stabilize the material and eliminate natural stone's unpredictability.

## Quartz vs. Granite Countertops: A Complete Comparison - Kitchen Infinity
Yes, quartz does scratch more easily than granite. This is because around 6-7% of quartz is man-made polymers and resins, so the overall material is less stable and tends to be a bit more flexible than granite. When you scratch a quartz counter, the flexibility of this resin can make scratches easier to inflict.
