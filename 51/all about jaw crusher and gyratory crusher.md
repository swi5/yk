The jaw crusher will handle sticky,'or dirty feed better than the gyratory, there being no diaphragm below the crushing chamber on which such material can pack. Routine maintenance and repair jobs are generally more easily accomplished on the jaw crusher than on the gyratory. Major repairs are about a stand-off.

## Different types of crushers for distinctive needs - Metso Outotec
All rock crushers can be classified as falling into two main groups. Compressive crushers that press the material until it breaks, and impact crushers that use the principle of quick impacts to crush the material. Jaw crushers, gyratory crushers and cone crushers operate according to the compression principle.

A gyratory crusher was patented by Philetus W. Gates in 1881. Thomas A. Edison also designed a rock crusher to use in his own mining operation. Edison's design used giant rolls to function as a primary crusher. These machines never gained much popularity though because the gyratory and jaw crushers were more versatile.

## How does gyratory crusher work?s
How does a gyratory cone crusher work? Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h.
