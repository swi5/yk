## how a jaw crusher works and what it is used for
A Jaw Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws (feed opening). For instance, a 24 x 36 jaw crusher has a opening of 24" by 36", a 56 x 56 jaw crusher has a opening of 56" square.
