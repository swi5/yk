The thread mill used must have a relief angle greater than that of the multi-start thread's lead angle in order to machine the thread. Thread pitch is the distance from a point on the screw thread to a corresponding point on the next thread measured parallel to the axis, typically measuring the distance between thread crests.

## ball load calculation in ball mills
ball load calculation in mills. The axial load carrying capacity of angular contact ball bearings increases as the contact angle increas The contact angle is defined as the angle between the line joining the points of contact of the ball and the raceways in the radial plane, along which the combined load is transmitted from one raceway to another, and a line.

The starting point for ball mill media and solids charging generally starts as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical, irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 10%-15% above the ball charge for total of 23%
