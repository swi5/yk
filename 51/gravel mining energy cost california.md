## The Detrimental Impacts of Russian River Gravel Mining - California 
n-stream mining in excess of the amount of gravel replenished each year causes the undermining of bridges and erosion of the River's banks and its tributaries. The Healdsburg &endash; 101 bridge has already been replaced at a cost to taxpayers of $10 million dollars.

## Placer Mining Cost
The cost of hydraulic mining depends largely on the magnitude of the operations. With large quantities of water available at a cheap rate, and big banks of soft gravel, the cost has been reduced in California, while the average cost was about low cents, and only in exceptional cases amounted to as much as 5x higher per cubic yard.

While the mine would yield 2,720kg of diamonds and help establish the De Beers mining company, which remains a major industry player to this. Chinese miners in the late 1800s
