The economic feasibility is much more dependent on the refuse disposal system than on the preparation system. It is estimated that the capital cost of an in-mine preparation and disposal system would be $6.00 per clean ton and the operating cost would be $1.24 per clean ton for a 1-million-clean-ton-per-year mine.
