## History Of Gold Refining | My Gold Guide
The technology boom for developing pure gold continued with E.B. Miller's process of refining impure gold with chlorine gas (patented in Britain in 1867) and Emil Wohlwill's electro-refining process (introduced in Hamburg, Germany, in 1878). In fact, gold with purity of 99.99 percent is created using a combination of the processes.

The most you can get for gold is 99.92% that is for single refining and only if you spend a long time putting a lot of nitric acid, usually it's between 99.60 to 99.80%. You can achieve 99.99% through electrolytic refining sometime called electrorefining. The hard part is silver, if you use copper to precipitate silver nitrate solution, you can

## Refining platinumthoidaifo
Platinum group metals (PGM) are refined using highly sophisticated chemical methods that are particular to their composition. The use of the right compounds, as well as the chemical reactions that occur, makes it easier to separate PGM from other elements that may be attached. Refining is the process of purifying an impure metal in metallurgy.
