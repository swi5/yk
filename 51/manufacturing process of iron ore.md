## Iron Ore Sintering Process in Steel Manufacturing
Sinter is the primary feed material for making iron in a blast furnace. Sinter is created by mixing iron ore concentrate with several additives such as limestone and silica to control the chemistry and then igniting it at 1200°C in a continuous belt-fed furnace. Sinter feed composition control is important because the various sinter feed

The ironmaking process in the blast furnace is a heat and mass transfer process, and the furnace can be divided into different zones according to physical and chemical state of the feed and temperature. Figure 1.1.5 illustrates various zones of the blast furnace and feed distribution and materials flow [13].Corresponding to each temperature interval, typical reactions will take place.

## Process of Steel-making from Iron Ore
Its production process is basically similar, melting pig iron into hot metal and then adding some substances in the hot metal, such as oxygen, and iron ore, which makes it react with the carbon in the hot metal so as to reduce the carbon content in the hot metal. Then pour the purified hot metal into the mold and make it into steel after cooling.
