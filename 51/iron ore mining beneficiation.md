## The Beneficiation Techniques for 5 Types of Iron Ores in Vietnam
The global professionals of iron mine beneficiation have been doing the research work of removing sulfur and phosphorous from iron ore. The experiment shows that the highest grade of iron concentrate can be obtained by the process of stage grinding → high-gradient strong magnetic separation → discarding tails → flotation to remove

## The value of mineralogical analysis for iron ore mining and 
Oct 8, 2020This "Mineralogy in Mining" blog series started with a general overview of the value of mineralogical monitoring for an efficient ore beneficiation.During the last decades high-grade iron ore deposits, particularly in Western Australia, required hardly any downstream processing. Iron ores were simply crushed and shipped as lump ore for iron making.

The haematite ore in South Africa is processed in a dry process to a HQ lump ore with 64 % iron content and a sintered fine ore with 63.5 % iron content. For fine ore beneficiation, wet processes are used. Capacity at the Minas Rio is to be increased from 26.5 Mta capacity to 28 Mta in the forthcoming years.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## 5 Refractory Iron Ore Beneficiation Processes - Xinhai
Sep 7, 202201 Refractory siderite beneficiation method. The grade (theoretical grade) of siderite is low, only 48.02%, and it is often symbiotic with calcium, magnesium and manganese. The available beneficiation methods for this type of iron ore include gravity separation, strong magnetic separation, flotation, roasting and combined beneficiation.
