## Effect of Coal Water Slurry Gasification Slag on Soil Water Physical 
The reason was that the gasification slag has large specific surface area and porous and uniformed pores [21, 22] due to the high temperature (°C) and chilling effect of the coal gasification process, allowing it to absorb more water than its own weight; thus improved the soil structure, increased aggregates and other functions and
