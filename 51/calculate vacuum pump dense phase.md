## Lean Phase Vacuum Conveying | GEA Powder Handling
Vacuum Conveying - Dense Phase. Dense phase vacuum conveying systems use high capacity vacuum pumps (up to 99% vacuum) to convey materials from a feed hopper or silo to a receiving vessel or vacuum hopper where the air and product are separated by a filter. When the vessel is full, the vacuum is isolated and the conveyed product is discharged

## How to Calculate Vacuum Flow Rate - Cleaning Beasts
To measure the leak flow rate of the vacuum, Close the inlet and outlet openings. Only open the end that leads to the pump. Open the pump and start it. Measure the leak rate by pumping to the known pressure. At this time, record the pressure. Then turn off the pump and allow the pressure to rise for one to five minutes.

## Single Phase vs Three Phase Pump Configurations
A three-phase pump requires a comparatively higher starting torque, but if operated for a long time, it is more efficient than a single-phase motor. Hence we use them for industrial applications where a pump, once turned on, remains on for a long duration of time. Due to their simpler design and compact size, they also generate less vibration
