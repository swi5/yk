## Vermiculite For Plants: How To Use It - COMPLETE GUIDE
The pre-growth of vegetable plants is a clean thing in vermiculite. Vermiculite stores moisture extremely well. You prefer to grow your plants in closed containers. The seedlings grow much more loosely in vermiculite than in soil and can be separated much better when it comes to pricking. This prevents root damage.

At peak output, the WR Grace vermiculite mine located in Libby was producing 80% of the world's vermiculite.

## Perlite vs. Vermiculite: How and Why to Use Them - Garden Betty
Like perlite, vermiculite is an effective soil conditioner that can loosen compacted soil, provide drainage, and hold three to four times its weight in water. But—and this is an important but —vermiculite is more compressible and less porous than perlite, giving vermiculite higher water-holding capacity when it's used as a planting medium.

## Vermiculite and Asbestos: How to Minimize the Risks
As a result, there are many regions where there simply isn't a local vermiculite processing plant. Because of a lot of bad publicity about Libby and the Libby vermiculite mine, many of the larger "box stores" no longer stock and supply vermiculite. Today, most vermiculite is safe. However, that is not to say it cannot contain asbestos.

Both perlite and vermiculite are made by heating earthing rocks to high temperatures of over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit in mining and processing plants. The high temperature pops the stone and creates a somewhat popcorn-like structure in both instances.

Vermiculite is Greate for Seed Starting. When vermiculite is used for seed germination or plant propagation, it takes a long time for particles to dry out so the root zone stays wet longer. There is a litter risk of root rot or damping-off. When transplanting, particles lets plants be pulled from the vermiculite without damage to the root systems.

## Does vermiculite hold moisture?
Vermiculite has the ability to absorb moisture from the air and hold it. This makes it ideal for seed germination and plant propagation. It's also perfect for potting mixes, because it doesn't decompose. However, one thing to keep in mind is that it holds too much moisture for some plants.
