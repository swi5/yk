## The Kimberley Process: Alleviating Poverty in the Diamond Trade
The Kimberley Process. Implemented in 2003, the Kimberley Process seeks to reduce diamond-related violence and increase revenues for exporting governments through a "chain of custody" certification process. Diamonds are verified and tracked at every stage—from the mine to the in-store buyer— via exhaustive documentation.
