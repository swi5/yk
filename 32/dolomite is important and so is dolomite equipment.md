An important fluxing reagent in electric furnaces and furnaces that employ oxygen is lime. Lime is used in the manufacturing process of steel to purge it of impurities such as silica, phosphorus, and sulfur. Lime combines with contaminants to generate slag, which is removed. This treatment increases the grade of the steel.

## Agricultural Limestone vs Dolomite - Braen Stone
Pros - Like aglime, dolomite is able to very effectively raise soil pH. At the same time, it's able to correct soil with a magnesium deficiency. For optimum health, sandy soil should have a calcium to magnesium ratio of 7:1 for sandy soil and 10:1 for clay-based soil. Cons - Dolomitic lime shouldn't be applied where it isn't needed.
