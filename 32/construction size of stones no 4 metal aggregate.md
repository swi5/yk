## Characteristics of Good Building Stone | Construction Aggregate 
Specific gravity of a good building stone lies between 2.4 to 2.8. Hardness: When stones are utilized for floors, pavements, aprons of bridges and weirs of rivers, the stones are subjected to abrasive forces which are caused by the wear and friction. Hence the stones which are to be used in such places should be tested for hardness.

## Unlike natural roundl-restaurierung
Crusher-run gravel compacts well but does not drain very fast -- at least not as fast as 3/4-inch crushed stone (no fines). Talk to a soils engineer if you are worried -- but in my experience, either crusher-run gravel (compacted) or 3/4-inch crushed stone can be used under footings. So can rigid foam. An engineer may disagree.

Aggregates are generally thought of as inert filler within a concrete mix. But a closer look reveals the major role and influence aggregate plays in the properties of both fresh and hardened concrete. Changes in gradation, maximum size, unit weight, and moisture content can all alter the character and performance of your concrete mix.

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
Because large stones and quarries are hard on tires and require heavy metal, crushed stone was hard to make and transport until heavy machinery with tracks was developed. WW2 expedited the development of this machinery, and crushed stone began to be widely used in construction projects in the 1940s and 1950s.

## Aggregates - Types of Aggregates | Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate
Aggregate is a granular material, such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, crushed hydraulic-cement concrete, or iron blast-furnace slag, used with a hydraulic cementing medium to produce either concrete or mortar. Those particles that are predominantly retained on the 4.75 mm (No. 4) sieve, are called coarse aggregates. Those particles passing the 9.5 mm (3/8 inch)

## What are Classification of stone and Types of stone - Civil Knowledges
Physical Classification of stone. Depends upon Physical classification rocks are classified into two groups, namely, stratified and unstratified. Stratified Stones. These stones are derived from sedimentary rocks. These stones are found in layers one above another Limestone and sandstones are the stratified stone.

## Aggregates for Concrete - GreenSpec
- Coarse aggregates are particulates that are greater than 4.75mm. The usual range employed is between 9.5mm and 37.5mm in diameter. - Fine aggregates are usually sand or crushed stone that are less than 9.55mm in diameter. • Typically the most common size of aggregate used in construction is 20mm. A larger size, 40mm, is more common in mass
