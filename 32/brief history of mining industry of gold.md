Tanzania is a land rich in minerals. Mining makes up more than 50% of the country's total exports, of which a large part comes from gold.The country has gold reserves of 10 million ounces, generating revenue of over a billion USD. Diamonds are also found in significant amounts. Since it was opened in 1940, the Williamson diamond mine has produced 19 million carats (3,800 kg) of diamonds.
