## Mining: Potash: Refinery Process - GitHub Pages
This process separates the potash from the salt particles. This process is used to recover many minerals, is based on the fact that, when in aqueous suspension, mineral particles that are coated with certain chemicals will cling to rising air bubbles. Chemical reagents are added to the salt and potash mixture. The chemicals added to the ore

The wells snake through the high-grade potash beds, introducing a heated salt water solvent directly to the potash ore, and thus immediately initiate the potash leaching process. This has great sustainable and green mining potential.

Mining Machines: Potash is mined using two and four rotor continuous boring machines. They can mine up to 900 tonnes per hour, making paths of up to 7.9 metres wide and 3.7 metres high.  A process plant separates the salt from the potash and converts the potash to the final product, ready for storage & shipping. Conventional Solution Mining.

More than 60% of the potash produced was MOP. Potash mining. Today, potash comes from either underground or solution mining. Underground potash deposits come from evaporated sea beds. Boring machines dig out the ore, which is transported to the surface to the processing mill, where the raw ore is crushed and refined to extract the potassium salts.

Salt production in Saskatchewan comes from different sources. Salt as a byproduct of the potash industry is stockpiled on site at the various mines. Salt from a salt mining operation is produced by one producer in Saskatchewan. Salt from Saskatchewan can be processed to use as table salt, water softener or as road de-icer.

## Potash Mining Threatens Bonneville Salt Flats - Street Muscle
Since 1939, a potash recovery operation has been operating on land leased by the BLM. The process works by collecting saltwater from the area and pumping it into evaporation pools to collect the minerals. Over the years, there has been a very direct impact on the Salt Flats area, which once covered 96,000 acres.

For potash solution mining, when the pond water is re-injected into the deep salt-bearing formation to extract potash, various microorganisms feed off the organic matter. In the absence of air (when the incidentally injected oxygen is used up) underground, the sulfate ion becomes a source of oxygen, leaving hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) as a byproduct.

## Potash Mining and Processing Infographic | eKonomics
Potassium bearing minerals are mined from underground ore deposits or extracted from salt lakes and brines. (e.g. Great Salt Lake, Utah and the Dead Sea). These deposits were formed as ancient oceans evaporated, leaving behind concentrated salt layers that were subsequently buried by sediment. Most potash mines today are deep shaft mines.

## Concerns about War Increase Efforts to Mine Potash in Michigan 
Table salt is a byproduct of the process, which the company would sell, too. This form of mining requires a lot of water: The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, or EGLE, has already granted permission for Michigan Potash to extract 725 million gallons of groundwater each year.

Potash is mined from deep underground deposits left by ancient inland seas. Such underground potash deposits like Picadilly can span a distance of approximately 10 km. Conveyors are the most effective way to convey material throughout the mine and to the production shafts, and from the production shafts to the processing plant.
