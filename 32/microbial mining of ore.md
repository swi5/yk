On the other hand, microbial metabolism can also contribute to the formation of certain ore deposits over geological time. Microbes occur in high numbers in soil, and due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, it is the negative net charge of the cell envelope that makes these organisms prone to accumulate metal cations from the environment

## Biomining: metal recovery from ores with microorganisms
Biomining is an increasingly applied biotechnological procedure for processing of ores in the mining industry (biohydrometallurgy). Nowadays the production of copper from low-grade ores is the most important industrial application and a significant part of world copper production already originates from heap or dump/stockpile bioleaching.

What is biomining? Biomining is mineral processing with microbes. Biomining is the process of using microorganisms (microbes) to extract metals of economic interest from rock ores or mine waste. Biomining techniques may also be used to clean up sites that have been polluted with metals. Valuable metals are commonly bound up in solid minerals.

## Biomining
In the industrial microbial leaching process popularly known as bioleaching, low grade ore is dumped in a large pile (the leach dump) and a dilute sulfuric acid solution (pH 2) is percolated down through the pile. The liquid coming out at the bottom of the pile, rich in the mineral is collected and transported to a precipitation plant where the metal is reprecipitated and purified.

## Biomining
Biohydrometallurgy is used to perform processes involving metals, for example, microbial mining, oil recovery, bioleaching, water-treatment and others. Both of these species are used in the biohydrometallurgy industry in methods called bioleaching and biomining, whereby metals are extracted from their ores through bacterial oxidation.
