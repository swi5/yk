## Abstract of Cause of the Numerous Open Pit Mine Equi - Count - IJSR
Dr. Dyson Galatia. This study investigates the cause of the numerous open pit equipment accidents at X Mining Company (XMC) during the period January 2019 to December 2020. The motivation for this study came from the large number of equipment accidents occurring at the Mine despite the available safety and management interventions.

## Why open pit mines?s
When would open-pit mining be most useful? 4.2 Open-pit mining Open-pit mining is probably most advanced because of developments in mining low-grade copper deposits and iron ore. It is suitable for much of the resource if it is done on a large scale and will allow low-cost removal of most of the resource.

## Open-pit mining
Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow.. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially

Open-pit mining is the process of extracting rock or minerals from the earth through their removal from an open pit or borrow. Figure 8.8. Open-pit mine [16]. Surface mining is usually used to develop coal seams and deposits of many other minerals, but their feasibilities vary with the nature of the body ore.

In large open pits the main implements for loading are electric, diesel-electric, or hydraulic shovels, while electric or mechanical-drive trucks are used for transport. The size of the shovels is generally specified by dipper, or bucket, size; those in common use have dipper capacities ranging from 15 to 50 cubic metres (20 to 65 cubic yards).

## Open Pit Mining - Africa Surveyors
O pen Pit Mining also called open-cut or open-cast mining, is surface mining technique of extracting minerals or rock from beneath the earth, often dug in an open area. This type of mining is one of the numerous varieties of surface mining that has been used since ancient times for different types of minerals. It involves large amounts of rock and is therefore expensive to produce.
