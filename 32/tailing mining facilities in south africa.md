## Tailings management | Sibanye-Stillwater
2 days agoIn South Africa, the principle management guidance document for tailings storage facilities is SANS 10286, the origin of which dates back to 1998. This standard contains fundamental objectives, the principles and minimum requirements for best practice, all aimed at ensuring that no unavoidable risks, problems and/or legacies are left to future

## Converting Tailings Dumps into Mineral Resources
Similarly, tailings dumps arising from the processing of chrome ore in the Lower Group reefs of the BC are also being retreated to recover PGEs. Several commercially profitable enterprises have also been set up with the sole intention of retreating tailings dumps arising from South Africa's Witwatersrand gold processing operations.

## Navigating the ESG of Tailings Management - ERM
Tailings dams are at last receiving the attention and focus they deserve. It is a strange paradox that, while the mining industry has made huge strides in integrating environmental and social governance (ESG) into key business decisions over the last 30 years, it has only recently started to get to grips with the risks posed by its waste disposal sites, in particular tailings storage
