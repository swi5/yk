## Roller Kilns | Nutec Bickley
Roller kilns comprise a refractory roller conveyor to transport product through a hot tunnel without using kiln cars. Product is placed directly on the roller conveyor or on support plates. The tunnel gets gradually hotter towards the middle so the temperature profile is created by different temperatures at different sections of the kiln.
