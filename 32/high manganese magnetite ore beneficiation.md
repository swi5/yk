## Manganese Ore Beneficiation Technology And Beneficiation Technology
Currently, only Zunyi manganese ore is used in the strong magnetic-flotation process. The ore is a low-manganese, low-phosphorus and high-iron manganese ore based on manganese carbonate ore. According to industrial tests, the grinding process adopts rod mill-ball mill stage grinding, and the equipment scale is φ2100mm×3000mm wet grinding machine.
