## Grading Of Aggregate | Ultimate Guide - Construction How
Aggregate gradation is of 4 types as explained below: 1.Well-Graded: An aggregate sample is said to be well-graded if it possesses all the required sizes in the required proportions. In other words, such a sample has a wide range of particle sizes present in the mix. Fig1. Fig. 1: Well-graded Aggregate Sample 2.Gap-Graded:

Adiabatic temperature-rise tests of concrete made with AASHTO type II cements, pozzolan, and locally available coarse aggregates were performed in the laboratory under conditions that represent those that will occur in the field. A total of 20 mixes with cements from two different sources and various percentages of pozzolanic materials were placed at two.

The aggregates are graded as per IS code 383, when the aggregate size is less than 4.75mm is called fine aggregate & more than 4.75mm is called coarse aggregate. The aggregate gradation is determined by the fineness modulus method where aggregates are passing through the sieve as per IS standard to classify its size.

## Effects of combined aggregate gradation on the compression strength and 
Aggregate gradation (particle size distribution) is a very important part of concrete production hence the need to combine coarse aggregate with fine aggregate in its simplest form. An improperly graded aggregate structure can have undesirable effects on the properties of concrete as it can produce weak, stiff or porous concretes.

A. Combined fine and coarse aggregates grading is specified to ensure that a satisfactory amount of aggregate with a minimum amount of void spaces is obtained. This will enable the use of a minimum amount of paste (water and cementitious material) in concrete, improving the dimensional stability and the durability.

## GRADING REQUIREMENTS OF FINE AGGREGATES - Civil Engineers PK
The fine aggregates shall have not more than 45% passing any sieve and retained on the next consecutive sieve of those shown in the aforementioned table. Concrete with fine aggregate grading near the minimums for percent passing the Sieve No.50 and Sieve No.100 sometimes have difficulties with workability, pumping or excessive bleeding.

## Concrete Mix Design: Understanding Aggregate - NPCA - Precast
Aggregate is deemed flaky and elongated when it satisfies both the previously mentioned conditions. Elongated or flaky particles exceeding 15% should be considered unsuitable for concrete use. When considering the combined gradation for the aggregates, a compromise between workability and economy is necessary to produce a suitable mix.

## What is Grading of Aggregates and Grading Limits? - The Constructor
Grading of aggregates is an important factor for concrete mix design. These affect the concrete strength as well as durability. Proper grading is important for concrete construction. Following tables provides details for grading limits of aggregates. Grading Limit for Single Sized CoarseAggregates (Based on Clause 4.1 and 4.2 of IS: 383- 1970)
