## Approximate Queries in Peer-to-Peer Systems | SpringerLink
Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks enable the interconnection of a huge amount of information sources without imposing costs for a central coordination infrastructure. Due to the dynamic and self-organizing nature of such networks, it is not feasible to guarantee completeness and correctness as in traditional distributed databases.

## Peer To Peer File Sharing Database Project Source Code in ASP.Net
On internet peer to peer networks utilize 70 percent of bandwidth and lot of load comes from query processing. As database is accessed to download and upload documents, media files, software applications there is need for efficient query processing methods. Solving this problem is not a easy task and time consuming and also difficult to implement.

## A Database Query Processing Model in Peer-To-Peer Network
database query processing scheme is proposed to limit the search space of the given query by a domain based query routing mechanism which limits the search to related peers. A database query processing model in peer-to-peer networks was designed using top-k query processing technique and implemented using Java, and MySql.

Therefore, P2P systems are usually applied in areas where approximate query evaluation, i.e., the computation of a nearly complete and correct answer set, is sufficient. As the most frequent application of querying in P2P is search, many of these algorithms fall into the class of top-k query algorithms. Another important case is the

A peer-to-peer network is a group of computers or devices that share resources and access shared resources without centralized control. In the group, there is no central authority that defines access rules. All group members have equal rights. A member cannot control another member in any form. How does a peer-to-peer network work?

## Approximate Queries in Peer-to-Peer Systems | SpringerLink
The main challenge in P2P approximate query processing is to select the optimal subset of peers to which the query is forwarded. However, the selection criteria for this subset are completely different for top-k and aggregate queries.While in top-k the goal is to identify the peers holding top objects, approximate aggregate querying algorithms need to find a representative sample of peers.

## Efficient Approximate Query Processing in Peer-to-Peer Networks
CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Abstract—Peer-to-peer (P2P) databases are becoming prevalent on the Internet for distribution and sharing of documents, applications, and other digital media. The problem of answering large-scale ad hoc analysis queries, for example, aggregation queries, on these databases poses unique challenges.
