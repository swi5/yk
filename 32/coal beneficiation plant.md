Coal Beneficiation Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both. Two basic processes of beneficiation: - Dry-deshaling: Non-coal or shaly-coal is removed without using any liquid media.
