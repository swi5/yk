## Why Use Ground Penetrating Radar on Construction Sites? - Safe2core
Answer: Ground penetrating radar GPR technology has proven to be an extremely reliable method of detecting subsurface aberrations that indicate the presence of disturbed soil and rock, as well as objects buried within them. One of the leading proponents of GPR applications of geophysics is Dr. Lawrence Conyers of the University of Denver.

## Ground Penetrating Radar Services | GPR | Locate Rebar - Olson Engineering
The Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) method as applied to foundation testing is primarily used to map rebar in foundation tops and to measure the depths of abutments, mats, spread footings, and other relatively shallow concrete foundations.The method can also be used to locate and map shallow buried foundations without excavation. The GPR method receives and measures the reflections of radio
