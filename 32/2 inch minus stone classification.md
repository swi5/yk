Description. 2 1/2" Minus Crushed Basalt is a construction grade crushed rock, that goes through a 2 1/2" screen and contains the fines for compaction. Since the material falls through a 2 1/2" square screen, some pieces will be larger than 2 1/2" if you measure with a tape since they can fall length-wise through the 2.5inch x 2.5inch opening.
