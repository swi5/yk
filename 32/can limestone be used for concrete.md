## Limestone Vs. Crushed Concrete | eHow
Limestone vs. Crushed Concrete. In its pure form, limestone differs significantly from crushed concrete in that the former constitutes a naturally formed rock found in marine environments and the other a manmade construction material. Limestone may appear in crushed concrete as a material found in the cement used to mix concrete.

## Why is concrete made from limestone? - Profound-Answers
Can limestone be used as aggregate in concrete? Crushed limestone has several important advantages over river gravel as an aggregate for concrete. First, for a given amount of cement in the mix, crushed limestone concrete will have an approximately 10% strength advantage. This is because most gravel is silica.

Lime is one of the oldest materials used by humans, and it is derived from burnt limestone. It has been used for millennia in combination with concrete and mortar mixes for denser building materials. It fell out of favor in the 19th century as using cement became a more standard building practice, but there are still many benefits to using it.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

Feb 16, 2022According to Tennis, Thomas and Weiss, "Heats are generally increased when limestone is used as an addition to concrete but decreased slightly when the limestone is used as a replacement for cement. However, it does not decrease to a point where the limestone can be considered to be completely inert.".

## 3 Reasons Why It's Important To Use Crushed Stone Under Concrete Slabs
Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab. Adding a layer of crushed stone will add proper drainage, as well as create a barrier between your slab and the ground.
