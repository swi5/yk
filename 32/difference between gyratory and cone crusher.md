## Gyratory and Cone Crusher - ScienceDirect
The gyratory crushers crush to reduce the size by a maximum of about one-tenth its size. Usually, metallurgical operations require greater size reduction; hence, the products from the primary crushers are conveyed to secondary or cone crushers where further reduction in size takes place. Here, the maximum reduction ratio is about 8:1.

## Operating principle of cone crusher
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.

The standard cone crusher has a large head angle, coarser discharge and higher output. It is generally placed behind the rough crusher (jaw crusher or gyratory crusher) for medium crushing. The head angle and the size of the discharge port of the short-head cone crusher are relatively small, and a finer product size can be obtained.
