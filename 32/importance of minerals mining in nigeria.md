## The importance of mining - The Frisky
After a century of cyclical yet continuous growth, the mining industry is still considered to be one of the fastest-growing sectors globally. More specifically, the contribution of mining to a country, especially the export of raw minerals is exceptionally important. The minerals and metals we rely on every day of our lives are staggering.

Nigeria has about 10 million tons of lead and zinc which are found in natural deposits situated in eight about 8 states in the country. Lead is used for producing ammunition for military uses, it is also the mineral of choice when producing diodes for batteries for vehicles. Lead has many other industrial uses as well.

## Tin
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-coloured metal. Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.
