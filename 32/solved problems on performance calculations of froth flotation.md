Flotation. Background. Froth flotation is the follow-on operation, after comminution and classification, in the process of liberating and separating minerals by exploiting the differences in physical properties of the different minerals that make up an ore. Froth flotation is achieved when particles are separated based on their surface potential.

## Mass Transfer Operations For The Practicing Engineer
Froth Floatation Have Also Been Discussed.A Large Number Of Digital Computer Programs Are Included To Illustrate Computer-Aided Techniques.Several Solved Examples And Practice Problems Are Presented In Each Chapter To Illustrate The Theory.With All These Features, This Is An Ideal Text For Undergraduate Chemical Engineering Students.

## Calculate Flotation Cell Capacities Volume vs Retention Time
Five minutes conditioning time and 15 minutes flotation time are desired. Adding 15% as a volume factor for aeration, the estimated flotation cell volume needed will be 290 cubic meters. If cells of 29,000 Liters volume are chosen, N will be 10. Similarly calculating for the 5-minute conditioning time at the same pulp density gives (see below).

## The Effects of Frothers and Particles on the Characteristics of Pulp 
The pulp and froth zones are the main components of froth flotation as it defines both quality of the end product and overall efficiency. The importance of the properties of the two zones, which include pulp hydrodynamics, froth bubble coalescence rate, water overflow rate, air recovery, etc., is being increasingly recognized. The properties are depending not only on the type and concentration
