## Manganese Ore - Gencler Mining
MANGANESE 0RE High grade metallurgical manganese ore is generally smelted and refined to produce ferromanganese, an alloy which has long been used in the processing of steel.Just as the main downstream use of ferrochrome is stainless steel. ferromanganese is beneficiated as carbon steel. As an alloying agent, ferromanganese is invaluable.

## What is Manganese Ore And Its Uses? - Industrial Mechanical
Manganese ores are used without being processed. These are first analyzed in the mines and then graded. After grading, they are sent off for further processing. Two alloys ferromanganese and silicomanganese are extracted during this process. Both of these alloys are used constantly for matallurgical applications.

## Hydrometallurgical Processing of Manganese Ores: A Review
Hydrometallurgy is the most suitable extractive technique for the extraction and purification of manganese as compared to all other techniques including biometallurgy and pyrometallurgical processes. In the hydrometallurgical processing of manganese from its ore, the leach liquors often contain divalent ions such as iron, manganese, copper, nickel, cobalt and zinc along with other impurities

## Manganese Mining and Extraction | Manganese Mining Processing
A more progresive extraction of manganese involves directly reducing manganese ore into a heap leach. In this a natural gas is allowed to go through the bottom of the heap. The gas provides the heat and the reducing agent carbon monoxide. The leachable form is then sent through the grinding circuit and to reduce the particle size of the manganese.
