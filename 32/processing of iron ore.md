When iron ore is extracted from a mine, it must undergo several processing stages. Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

Thus, a mineral aggregate containing iron element or iron compound that can be used

## How iron is made - material, manufacture, making, history, used 
To produce iron, they slowly burned iron ore with wood in a clay-lined oven. The iron separated from the surrounding rock but never quite melted. Instead, it formed a crusty slag which was removed by hammering. This repeated heating and hammering process mixed oxygen with the iron oxide to produce iron, and removed the carbon from the metal.

## Iron ore pricing explained - Fastmarkets
Different percentages of iron content reflect both the natural variation in iron ore grades found in mine deposits and the degree of processing (if any) employed to upgrade the ore for a certain use. In general, higher purity ores help increase hot metal yields in the blast furnace, and also lower production cost by reducing the amount of coke

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
