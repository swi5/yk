## WOA1 - Process for joining conveyor belts by vulcanization 
What is proposed is a process for joining conveyor belts which contain metal inserts by vulcanization, and also a corresponding vulcanizing press. In order to achieve a temperature profile during the joining process which is more uniform over the material thickness in the joining region, in the proposed process - the belt portions to be joined are arranged between a first crossbeam leading

On the hot plate platform under the belt vulcanization equipment, rubber is first removed from the joints to form steps. Then on the step with solvent gasoline cleaning air - dry and coated with rinse glue. General rinse gum at least three times (glue with 120 solvent gasoline).Wait until the glue is dry (it is better not to stick to the hand).

1. Cold vulcanization joint process of conveyor belt. The most typical feature of the cold vulcanization process is that there is no equipment to heat and press it. It only relies on glue to connect the belt and the joint material. Therefore, the cold vulcanization joint has very high requirements for the selection of glue.

## Is formed by process of vulcanisation?s
Score: 4.1/5 (15 votes) . Vulcanization is a chemical process in which the rubber is heated with sulphur, accelerator and activator at °C. The process involves the formation of cross-links between long rubber molecules so as to achieve improved elasticity, resilience, tensile strength, viscosity, hardness and weather resistance.
