## vanadium separation from fly ash
vanadium, heavy fuel, fly ash, leaching, extraction 1. Introduction The power generation station that uses heavy oil produces a solid residue called fly ash [1]. Fly ash generated during oil combustion. Fly ash is rich in Ni, V, Fe, Mo, Mg, Na and C and among these metals Ni and V are the most valuable.

## vanadium separation from fly ash in philippines
In this study enrichment methods for coal fly ash CFA from Omsk thermal power station No 4 TPS-4 were investigated The magnetite and unburned carbon concentrates were obtained by magnetic separation and flotation methods The wet magnetic separation used in the study increased the magnetite content in the magnetic fraction from 1048 to 1272 wt compared to dry magnetic separation

## Process using carbonate reagent for recovering vanadium from cokes and 
Vanadium values are recovered from sulphur-containing cokes and ashes derived from heavy oils by a novel process comprising heating in the presence of alkali metal carbonate, contacting the resulting solid residue with water to form a leach and recovering the vanadium values dissolved therein. The amount of alkali metal carbonate used is at least sufficient to convert the vanadium values
