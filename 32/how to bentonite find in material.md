## Benseal/Sodium Bentonite - Sturgis Materials
Sodium bentonite is one of a family of bentonite clays. It is a chemically inert, organic material from the earth and comes in powder form. Many companies sell bentonite clay for a variety of purposes. Sodium bentonite clay, which has a natural swelling ability that's maintained throughout its use. It can swell 15 to 18 times its dry size.

Bentonite is used in retention systems and for the control of stickies and pitch. Furthermore, it helps to improve the loop water treatment which reduces water consumption. Bentonite is ideal for use in cat litter due to its unique water absorption, swelling, and odour-controlling properties. It is an excellent anti-caking agent for animal feed.

Bentonite Clay Granular, also known as sodium bentonite, is a clay compound useful in reducing water loss from ponds through aqueous seepage and holes. Expands as it absorbs water to fill small holes. Can provide short term control of water loss. Full effectiveness may take several minutes. Spread liberally where seepage and leakage is suspected.

Bentonite is a type of montmorillonite clay frequently used in clarifying juice and wines (both white and red). It is useful in removing unstable colloidal material from red wine, especially from grapes damaged by rough handling before or during destemming. Bentonite is also effective in removing heat-unstable proteins.

The bentonite is surrounded by a bubble of gas and floats up to the surface of the wine. When the bubble bursts, the particle of bentonite drops back down to the bottom of the carboy, all the time working to absorb the particles that are clouding the wine. In this way, the bentonite is circulated around the wine continuously for days, doing its

## How to add bentonite into IEEE 80 - Electric power & transmission 
The Bentonite vendor should be able to give the exact quantity of material to be used to achieve a certain desired resistivity. However, to improve the earth resistance, the better method is to go for the deep-well electrodes. This is a permanent solution. We have been using this in the deserts, where the soil resistivity was 3400Ω-m.

Bentonite. Bentonite is the common name for naturally occurring clay that contains the active montmorillonite mineral. The special properties of montmorillonite that enable commercial applications include the sub-micron platelet structure, very high surface area (≈800 m2/g), and inherent negative charge in the platelet that is counter
