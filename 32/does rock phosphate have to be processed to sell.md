## Using Rock Phosphate For Gardens - What Does Rock Phosphate Do For Plants
What is Rock Phosphate? Rock phosphate, or phosphorite, is mined from clay deposits that contain phosphorus and is used to make organic phosphate fertilizers that many gardeners utilize. In the past, rock phosphate was used alone as a fertilizer, but due to a lack in supply, as well as low concentration, most applied fertilizer is processed.
