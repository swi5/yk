## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and developed by Gates around 1881 and were referred to as a Gates crusher [1]. The smaller form is described as a cone crusher. The larger crushers are normally known as primary crushers as they are designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines.

The gyratory crusher has capacities starting from 1200 to above 5000 t/h. To have a feed opening corresponding to that of a jaw crusher, the primary gyratory crusher must be much taller and heavier. Therefore, primary gyratories require quite a massive foundation. The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher.

## How To Select Your Primary Crusher - JXSC Mining
The gyratory crusher has capacities starting from 1200 to above 5000 t/h. To have a feed opening corresponding to that of a jaw crusher, the primary gyratory crusher must be much taller and heavier. Therefore, primary gyratories require quite a massive foundation. The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher.

Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and further developed by Gates in 1881 (they were commonly referred to as a 'Gate's crushers' in the early years). A primary crusher is designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines. Gyratory crushers typically crush to reduce the size of aggregate to a maximum
