##  Limestone Quarrying and Processing: A Life-Cycle Inventory
2.1 Limestone Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate with the occasional presence of magnesium. Most limestone is biochemical in origin meaning the calcium carbonate in the stone originated from shelled oceanic creatures. Limestone can also be chemical in origin as is the case with travertine.

Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.

Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium.
