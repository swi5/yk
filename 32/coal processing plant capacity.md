## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity. Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, [1] but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.

##  Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines for Coal Processing
The main sources of emissions in coal processing facilities primarily consist of fugitive sources of particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen. Coal transfer, storage, and preparation activities may contribute significant ly to fugitive emissions of coal PM.
