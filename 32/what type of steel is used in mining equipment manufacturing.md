## How To Transport The Most Common Types of Mining Equipment
Mining Drills. Drilling equipment is perhaps the most commonly used in mining activities, specifically underground mining operations. They are used to drill and loosen the mineral ore for easy transportation to the surface. Miners widely use them because they reduce the number of people working in the mines and are also cost-effective to use.

## Steel
Steel is an alloy made up of iron with typically a few tenths of a percent of carbon to improve its strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. Many other elements may be present or added. Stainless steels that are corrosion- and oxidation-resistant typically need an additional 11% chromium.Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, steel is used in buildings
