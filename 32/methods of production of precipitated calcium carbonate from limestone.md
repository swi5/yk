## What is Calcium Carbonate Limestone? | Carmeuse
Calcium carbonate limestone, which is also recognized as the chemical compound CaCO3, makes up almost five percent of the earth's crust and is found all throughout the planet. Calcium carbonate's most common natural forms are limestone and marble. These raw materials are mostly produced by the sedimentation of the shells of foraminifera

## Production of precipitated calcium carbonate from calcium silicates and 
When calcium and carbonate ions have formed calcium carbonate and precipitated, the solution will be below saturation and more calcium hydroxide can dissolve. The commercially available carbonation process for PCC production is an example of this practice: the solid content of the slurry in the carbonation reactor is as high as 20% [17] .

## Performance of Separation Processes for Precipitated Calcium Carbonate 
An alternative production concept for calcium carbonate production is being developed that omits the need for fresh limestone and its calcination (Eloneva et al., 2009). This concept has the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions and simultaneously utilize steelmaking slag. In this process, calcium is selectively extracted from steelmaking slag

It was predicted that bacterial calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) precipitation occurs as a byproduct of common metabolic processes such as urea hydrolysis. In this study, ureolytic bacteria that were capable of precipitating calcium carbonate were isolated and further their urease activity was tested based on the production of urease.

## Rhombohedral calcium carbonate and accelerated heat-aging process for 
A form of calcium carbonate having a blocky rhombohedral crystal structure and properties including a surface area of from about 3 to about 15 m 2 /g, an average discrete particle size of from about 0.2 to about 0.9 micron, wherein the discrete particles have an aspect ratio less than about 2:1, and a particle size distribution such that at least about 60 weight percent of the particles have a
