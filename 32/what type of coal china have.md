## What is coking coal, and where is it used? - Kalkine Media
When heated, coking coal creates coke, which is a key material for the production of steel. There are many varieties of coal, ranging from anthracite, bituminous, lignite, peat to brown coal, but the unique caking ability of metallurgical coal makes it different from other forms of coal.

Anthracite Anthracite is the highest rank of coal. It has the most amount of carbon, up to 97%, and therefore contains the most energy. It is harder, more dense, and more lustrous than other types of coal. Almost all the water and carbon dioxide have been expelled, and it does not contain the soft or fibrous sections found in bituminous coal or

 There are four types of coal - peat, lignite, bituminous and anthracite. Each type has different proportions of carbon and thus, have different uses. Peat - This type of coal has less than 40% to 50% of carbon, while the remaining is moisture. This makes it difficult for us to ignite and cannot be easily used.

lignite: The carbon content in lignite coal is about 25-35% and has a low energy content among all the coal types known. Lignite has a high moisture content which contributes to its low heating value. Only 9% of the lignite coal was mined in the USA in the year 2020 among which 54% was mined in North Dakota and 39% was mined in Texas.
