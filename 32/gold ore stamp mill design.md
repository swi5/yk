The ore consisted of quartz, in which, above the 250-ft level, the iron-minerals were largely oxidized and some free gold was visible; below that level few traces of oxidation occurred, and pyrite constituted the principal mineralizer in the quartz, together with occasional pockets of galena and a few eccentric

## Stamp Mill - Explore Real California Gold Mines!
The stamp mill was the big gold machine of its day. By 1850 in California all of the rivers and streams had been picked clean of placer gold. It didn't take long for miners to follow the gold deep into the Sierra's steep valleys to snow white quartz outcroppings. They soon realized the gold trapped within these veins could produce thousands

The original Stamp Mill was built around the turn of the century as a community crusher for miners in the area. Rebuilt in the 1930's, the two sets of 4 stamps, when in full operation, could be heard in Placerville just one mile away. The Cornwall Mineral Collection with specimens from all over the world is on display in the building.
