## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

What is the process of extracting copper? First, the ore is treated with dilute sulphuric acid. This trickles slowly down through the ore, over a period of months, dissolving copper to form a weak solution of copper sulphate. The copper is then recovered by electrolysis. This process is known as SX-EW (solvent extraction/electrowinning).. How was copper first extracted?

## How deep-sea mining could destroy the 'cradle of life on earth'
The mining process in PNG will take the top 20-30m off the seabed at a depth of 1,500m and lift it up to the surface before transferring it by barge to processing sites on land. 'You will destroy fauna just by lifting the land,' says deep-sea ecologist Professor Paul Tyler, from the National Oceanography Centre at Southampton University.

For mining purposes, big machines are often used in order to make the mining process more effective and to reduce the physical work for miners. However, these machines emit large amounts of harmful gases, also including greenhouse gases like methane or CO2. Thus, mining can also cause air pollution and the implied consequences.
