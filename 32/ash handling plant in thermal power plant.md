## Operation and Maintenance (O & M) of Ash Handling System in Thermal 
Here are some points that we carefully deem regarding an ash handling system of a thermal power plant. 1. Checking the wear in Bottom Ash Hopper, Falling of clinker ash pieces in the hopper can damage the lining. There are chances of wear inside the flushing nozzles in the ash hopper. Incorrect alignment of nozzles can cause an erosional effect.

## Thermal power station
The energy efficiency of a conventional thermal power station is defined as saleable energy produced as a percent of the heating value of the fuel consumed. A simple cycle gas turbine achieves energy conversion efficiencies from 20 to 35%. Typical coal-based power plants operating at steam pressures of 170 bar and 570 Â°C run at efficiency of 35 to 38%, with state-of-the-art fossil fuel plants
