## Dust Collection and Control in Crusher Plant
Dust collection in the crushing plant is accomplished by two wet dust collectors with a total of 66,000 CFM. The dust collectors exhaust air is discharged to the upper ventilation system of the mine through an 800 ft. vertical raise and then through mine fans to the surface. The screening area exhaust system has exhaust hoods with 1500 CFM each

## P&Q University Lesson 7- Crushing & Secondary Breaking
