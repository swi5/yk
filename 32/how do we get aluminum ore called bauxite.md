## During extraction of aluminium from bauxite?
What ore is aluminium extracted from? Aluminium can be extracted (uneconomically) from some clays but the most common aluminium ore is a material called bauxite. First the aluminium ore needs to be mined, then the bauxite is refined into alumina (aluminium oxide). Large amounts of electricity are used to smelt the alumina into aluminium metal.

## Bauxite
Bauxite is a sedimentary rock with a relatively high aluminium content. It is the world's main source of aluminium and gallium.Bauxite consists mostly of the aluminium minerals gibbsite (Al(OH) 3), boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) and diaspore (α-AlO(OH)), mixed with the two iron oxides goethite (FeO(OH)) and haematite (Fe 2 O 3), the aluminium clay mineral kaolinite (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4) and small

## Difference Between Bauxite and Iron Ore | Definition, Composition 
Bauxite and iron ore are two such types that are found naturally on earth. Bauxite is also known as aluminum ore and contains aluminum bearing minerals. Iron ore is a type of rock from which we can extract iron. The main difference between bauxite and iron ore is that bauxite is a source of aluminum whereas iron ore is a source of iron.

Bauxite is best defined as an aluminum ore of varying degrees of purity in which aluminum in the form of aluminum hydroxide or aluminum oxide is the largest single constituent. The impurities are largely iron oxide, silica, and titania. Bauxite varies greatly in physical appearance, depending on its composition and impurities.
