## What Is Used To Mine Bauxite? | Knologist
Bauxite is a volcanic rock that has been used for making aluminum and other metals. It is a white, crystalline rock that is very hard and has a very high melting point.  However, generally speaking, the extraction process of bauxite involves extracting the bauxite from the ore body, and then smelting the bauxite to create a new alloy.

## Conversion of Bauxite Ore to Aluminum Metal - Elmhurst University
Aluminum is found in varying amounts in nature as aluminosilicates (contains aluminum, silicon, and oxygen) in various types of clay. As the minerals are weathered they gradually breakdown into various forms of hydrated aluminum oxide, Al 2 O 3 .xH 2 O, known as bauxite. The bauxite is purified by the Bayer Process.
