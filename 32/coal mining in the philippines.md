## About: Coal mining in the Philippines
Coal mining in the Philippines has a long history dating back to the 1800s during the Spanish colonization of the islands. The Philippines consumes more coal than it can produce and coal is the main source of electricity. 20% of the country's coal supply is used by the cement industry (in 2005). As of 31 September 2005, the in situ coal reserves of the Philippines amounts to 458 million metric

## Coal Mining Philippines
The Philippines Rich Untapped Gold Mining Areas. The Philippines are blessed with mineral and metal deposits due to its geology. The islands are on the top of underwater mountains that were formed due to the molten rocks from the interior of earth which created the ideal setting of a variety of valuable minerals.
