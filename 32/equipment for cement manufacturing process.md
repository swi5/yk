## Cement Manufacturing Process-SBM Industrial Technology Group
Oct 15, 2021Cement Manufacturing Process. . Summary： In brief, cement production has the following 7 steps: crushing and pre-homogenization, raw meal preparation, homogenization of raw meal, preheating decomposition, firing of cement clinker, cement grinding and cement package. Cement is a powdery hydraulic inorganic cementing material.

## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.

The Cement Manufacturing Process. Cement is a finely ground powder which, when mixed with water, forms a hardening paste of calcium silicate hydrates and calcium aluminate hydrates. Cement is used in mortar (to bind together bricks or stones) and concrete (bulk rock-like building material made from cement, aggregate, sand, and water).

At the final stage, cement is packaged into bags and ready to produce concrete. The first step in the process of making concrete is mixing cement, water, sand and gravel in the proportion of 15%, 10%, 25% and 50% respectively. This mixture is then put into a concrete mixer to produce concrete, which is used for building purposes.

Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

The second graph describes how the cement is used for concrete production for the construction works. First, 15% cement, 10% water, 25% sand and 50% small stones (also called gravel) are mixed together inside a mixer machine and the rotation of this mixer machine creates the concrete which is later on used for constructions of building.

The cement production process, for example, starts with mining of limestone, which is then crushed and ground to powder. It is then preheated to save energy before being transferred to the kiln, the heart of the process. The kiln is then heated to a high temperature of up to 1480 degrees to convert the material to a molten form called clinker.
