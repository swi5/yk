To achieve the lowest detection limits to analyse trace amounts, Eurofins offers high-resolution ICP-MS (HR-ICP-MS) as a modern method for heavy metal testing. Naturally, the differentiation of organic and inorganic arsenic and mercury as well as the determination of a broad range of further metals and elements via AAS and ICP-techniques are.

## USB1 - Method to avoid copper contamination during copper 
In accordance with the objects of this invention a new method to prevent copper contamination of the intermetal dielectric layer during etching, CMP, or post-etching and post-CMP cleaning by forming a dielectric cap for isolation of the underlying dielectric layer is described. In one embodiment of the invention, a dielectric layer is provided overlying a semiconductor substrate.

## Copper Cathode Contamination by Nickel in Copper Electrorefining
The observed contamination behavior of Ni in copper electroreﬁning is summarized in Figure 9 . Based on the results, it can be concluded that particle entrapment is the most

## TENORM: Copper Mining and Production Wastes | US EPA
Ores that contain copper in the U.S. are typically mined in large, open-pits. Copper processing facilities are usually located near mining or extraction sites. Significant waste volumes are associated with copper production. Mine wastes may contain radionuclides due to their natural presence in ores and can be a source of TENORM.
