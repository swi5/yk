In mining, the ore is extracted by drilling or blasting and then crushed and ground. The ore is then treated using extractive metallurgy. The Froth flotation process separates the Lead and other minerals from the waste rock (tailings) to form a concentrate. The concentrate, which can range from 50% to 60% Lead, is dried and then treated using

## Lead
Lead is a chemical element with the symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and atomic number 82. It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials. Lead is soft and malleable, and also has a relatively low melting point.When freshly cut, lead is silvery with a hint of blue; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element

## A geochemical characterization of lead ores in China: An isotope  - PLOS
A well reasoned lead (Pb) isotope-driven provenance study lies in concert with a comprehensively evaluated database of geological ore sources and accompanying archaeological and contextual information. In this paper we have compiled and evaluated all currently available Pb isotope data for galena and K-feldspars in China, and provided geological interpretations for how their ore-forming

## What is Lead? - Uses, Important Facts and Properties of Lead - BYJUS
Properties of Lead. Lead (Pb) is a white lustrous metal with a soft texture and is highly malleable. The metal is highly corrosion-resistant, in addition to not being a poor conductor of electricity. The metal in its powdered form produces a bluish-white flame when burnt in the air. Once mixed with fluorine at room temperature forms lead fluoride.

## Lead: The mineral native Lead information and pictures
Although Native Lead is not an ore of the element lead, the uses for that element will be briefly mentioned here: Lead is used in batteries, paint pigments, glasswork, and in sheathing electric cables. Its heavy mass enables it to be used as a shield for radioactive materials, including x-ray shielding. In recent times, much lead is being
