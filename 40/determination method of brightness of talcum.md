## Method of preparation of talcum product with high purity degree
The method which is the subject of protection is characteristic by the fact that firstly is made the suspension consisting of 10 to 20 mass % of mineral talc and 80 to 90 mass % of water; resulting suspension is homogenized and thereafter is heated to the temperature 50° to 70° C. To heated suspension is then added 37% hydrochloric acid in the amount of 1 to 6 mass % under continuous stirring.
