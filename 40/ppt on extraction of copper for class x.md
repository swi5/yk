## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels, called adits, to reach the ore. Underground mining is, however, relatively expensive and is

## Pulling-selbsthilfegruppe
Pulling.Traditionally, fibre optic cables were pulled through cable ducts in the same way as other cables, via a winch line.Every time the fibre passes a bend or undulation in the duct, the pulling force is multiplied by a friction-dependent factor (which can be reduced by using lubricant).This means that the higher the local pulling force is, the more friction the cable will experience
