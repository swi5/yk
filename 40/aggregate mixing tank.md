The truck drum is washed and dumped into the wash tank. The larger aggregates settle and are carried away by the first drag chain and stacked at the end of the washer. The finer aggregate and sand settle more slowly, thus carrying them to the second drag chain. The water is then recycled into the next ready-mix drum.

## They must also prevent corrosion damage to the tank. The coatings need 
They must also prevent corrosion damage to the tank. The coatings need to be resistant to aliphatic and aromatic petroleum products. A three-coat epoxy system meeting MIL-P-24441 is satisfactory for this use (three coats epoxy at 50-100 Œºm DFT per coat, Œºm DFT total). Zinc coatings should not be used in fuel tanks because zinc. –ú–µ—Ç–∫–∏: –ø—Ä–∏—Å–∞–¥–∫–∏ –¥–ª—è

## What are the Correct Concrete Mixing Ratios - Ratio Chart
1 : 3 : 3 MIX RATIO. To produce a 3000 psi cubic yard of concrete (27 cubic feet) the concrete mixture ratio is: 517 pounds of cement or (234kg) 1560 pounds of sand or (707kg) 1600 pounds of stone or (725kg) 32 - 34 gallons of water or (132L) This mixing ratio will give you a concrete mix that is strong, durable, and good for most concrete
