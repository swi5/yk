## process of chromium prodution from chromite - KOOKS
Chromium. For the production of pure chromium, the iron must be separated from the chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe 2 O 3.

## Production of Ferro-Chrome - IspatGuru
The following are the important characteristics of production process of Fe-Cr in a SAF. Reducibility of chromite ore is important for process efficiency. It is determined by its mineralogy (MgO/Al2O3 ratio), the MgO structural form in the chromite ore, chromite grain size, the extent of grains distribution in ore and the ore melting temperature.

## Smelting Process of Chromite Ore Fines to Produce Crude Fe-Cr-Ni-N 
Chromite ore can directly be used for the production of crude Fe-Cr-Ni-N alloy. Suitable nitrogen absorption and manganese addition in the Fe-Cr melt can replace the required nickel content for making austenitic stainless steel. This process can be used to eliminate the step of production of ferrochrome to produce stainless steel after
