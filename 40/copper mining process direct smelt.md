Copper Smelting Process Equipment. Introduction to Copper Smelting Techniques. Copper ore typically contains only about 0.6% of the actual copper mineral, the most common ore mined being chalcopyrite. The ore is attained using traditional methods of underground and open pit mining, the later accounting for 90% of the ore used in smelting.

## Copper Smelting Chemistry Tutorial - AUS-e-TUTE
A typical copper ore contains between 0.5% and 2.0% copper. A high grade ore produces a high yield of metal. A low grade order produces a low yield of metal. Copper can be extracted from sulfide ores (usually higher grade ores) by direct smelting. The earliest evidence of copper smelting occurs in Serbian artefacts dating from around 5000 BC.

## Ancient Egyptian Mining and Smelting - Ethan Holman
Copper ore was extracted and broken into small pieces and mixed with charcoal fuel in a fire on the ground or in a shallow pit. This method produced temperatures of between 700 and 800 degrees Celsius, enough to separate the metal from the rock, but not hot enough to reduce it to a truly molten state.

## Smelting
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore, to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.
