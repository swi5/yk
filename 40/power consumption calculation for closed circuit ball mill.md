of the Bond ball mill grindability test. For all model based methods, a reliable method to calculate mill power draw for a given mill is required for the calculation of power draw. Morrell (1996) proposed a mathematical model for autogenous, semi-autogenous and ball mills which is based on the motion of grinding charge inside the mill.
