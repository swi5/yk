## Crushed Sandstone - Burke's Backyard
Hawkesbury Sandstone is the best material to use. We recommend crushed sandstone that has a maximum diameter of 10mm, as this can be easily shovelled by hand. This material is usually sold for road base or to use under cement. It is available direct from the quarry for around $12/tonne (e.g. for a trailer load) or around $15/tonne delivered

Answer (1 of 8): To a geologist, soil scientist, engineer, and probably a few others, "sand" means a granular solid fragment between 0.05 mm to 2.0 mm in diameter. Grains larger than 2 mm are "gravel" (or cobbles and boulders if very large) and grains smaller than 0.05 mm are "silt" (clay is smal

The Sandstorm is a grinder found west of the quarry, operated by Drew, which grinds sandstone into buckets of sand.. To use this machine, players must deposit empty buckets (notes are accepted) with Drew, and must load the machine with sandstone, with heavier pieces of sandstone resulting in more buckets being filled with sand. They can then claim noted buckets of sand from Drew for 50 coins each.
