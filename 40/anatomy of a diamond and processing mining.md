## Diamond Industry Jobs: Mining Professionals - News from All Diamond
Assuming that the decision to mine is made, and a mining camp and processing plant are built, the long process of mining the deposit over many years begins to take place. There are hundreds of different people performing many different jobs every day in order to deliver ore to the plant, and keep diamond production moving consistently.

DIAMOND ANATOMY. The earliest diamond-cutting industry is believed to have started in Venice, Rome a widely recognised trade capital. The earliest form of diamond cutting is the point cut, with eight symmetrical facets in the shape of an octahedron. This diamond cut was later improved to a Table Cut, achieved by cutting off part of the top half

Diamond mines are open-cut or underground. The ore is blasted with explosives then loaded onto trucks for transport to a processing plant where it is cleaned and sorted. Large-scale, open-pit mining was initially used to extract diamond ore at Argyle. The mine is now a large scale underground block cave operation.

The average crown height is expressed as a percentage of the average girdle diameter. It can affect both the dispersion and brightness of a diamond. Crown Angle: The crown angle is the angle that's formed where the bezel facets meet the girdle plane. The crown angle in a well-cut diamond will be within 31.5 to 36.5 degrees.

## What is Diamond Processing? - SLTL
Diamond processing is the practice of changing a diamond from a rough stone into a faceted gem. Cutting diamond requires specialized knowledge, tools, equipment, and techniques because of its extreme difficulty. To the non-professional, an unpolished rough diamond appears to be very much like a dull piece of glass.

A diamond is comprised of the eight main components. They are Diameter, Table, Crown, Table Spread, Girdle, Pavilion, Depth, and Culet. Below is a brief description of each part of a diamond and its location. Diameter: The width of a polished stone, measured from edge to edge. Table: The largest polished facet located on the top of the diamond.

The depth percentage is one of the critical characteristics in evaluating a diamond's cut grade. The depth percentage refers to the ratio of the distance between the culet to the table and the stone's diameter measured across the girdle. Depth should measure from 54% to 66% of the gemstone's diameter to optimize its sparkle.
