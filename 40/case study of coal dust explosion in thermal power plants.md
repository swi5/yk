Coal dust generation varied from 0.3-65 g/min. Daily dust settlement ranged between 40 and 300 g/m/sup 2/. Total quantity of accumulated coal dust in the power plant ranged from 0.8-650 kg/day; 250 g/m/sup 3/ of coal dust may cause an explosion. Thus, a dangerous amount of coal dust, depending on work-site, will settle in 3.3.-21.8 days.

## Report: Human Error to Blame in Fatal India Plant Accident - POWER Magazine
The death toll from the explosion is the highest from a power-plant accident in recent years. An explosion at a hydropower station in Siberia in 2009 left 75 people dead.

## Coal Dust Explosions in the Cement Industry - Semantic Scholar
The number of coal fired industrial systems and utility power plants is rapidly increasing because of the high cost and uncertain availability of fuel oil and natural gas. For many cement producers in the United States, the conversion from fuel oil and natural gas to pulverized coal has been difficult, frustrating, and in a few cases, very costly. This study deals mainly with coal safety

4. Case study operation 4.1 Operation overview The study was done on coal handling plant for Harare Power Station which is a coal fired thermal plant which falls the under the administration of Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA). The station is currently equipped with nine steam boilers and six turbo generators.

## Power Plant Air Quality Monitoring - Case Study
Most of the thermal power plants generating electricity run on coal. Majority of these coal-fired plants violate air pollution standards, creating a major source of air pollution. In fact, in India, 26.45% premature annual deaths (among people above 25) result from thermal power plant pollution.
