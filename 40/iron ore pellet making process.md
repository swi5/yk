Iron ore pellets are marble-sized balls of iron ore that are fused with clay for transportation and used in steel manufacture. The process of making pellets from iron ore is called pelletizing. The manufacture of steel from low-grade iron ore involves processes like mining, crushing, separating, concentrating, mixing, pelletizing, and shipping.

## Iron Ore Pellet Production - FEECO International Inc.
Pellets are a high-grade source of iron ore and are produced via a type of agitation agglomeration (wet granulation or tumble-growth agglomeration) known as pelletizing, and referred to in the iron ore sector as "balling.". The balling process is carried out utilizing either a rotary drum or disc pelletizer - otherwise known as a balling

Historically, bentonite has been used in the agglomeration process in North American iron ore plants. In 1986, Eveleth Mines replaced bentonite with Peridur, a carboxy methyl cellulose organic binder used in conjunction with 1% limestone. Since May of 1993, Allied Colloids` Alcotac FE8 has been used by Eveleth as the replacement for bentonite.

Iron Ore Processing Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.

## Pellet Technology | Pellet Manufacturers Association of India
Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better strength (expressed technically as 'tumbling index') as compared to that of parent ore and can be used as a substitute in blast furnaces in countries where lump ore is not available. Pelletizing is a process of converting very fine iron ore (<100micron) into uniform sized
