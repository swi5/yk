## Jaw Crusher | Primary Crusher in Mining & Aggregate - JXSC Mine
Product Introduction. JXSC jaw type rock crusher is usually used as a primary crusher and secondary crusher to reduce the size of medium-hard materials to smaller physical size. Jaw rock crushers are capable of working with the mobile crushing station, underground crushing because of its related small volume. Capacity: 1-1120TPH.

## Chemical Analysis Of Fe In A Jaw Crusher - HN droled mine treatment 
Chemical analysis. Chemical composition was determined by spectrometric analysis using the spectrometer ARL 3460 model. Four cylindrical samples (F 1, F 2, F 3 and F 4) of about 40 mm diameter each with 5 mm thickness were taken from failed crusher jaws and one sample (S) of the same dimension was taken from a sound crusher jaw. The selected

## Analysis of the cause of abnormally elevated temperature of jaw crusher 
The jaw crusher is also a jaw crusher, referred to as E-breaker. It is mainly used for medium-size crushing of various ores and bulk materials. It is widely used in mining, smelting, building materials, roads, railways, water conservancy and chemical industries. The highest compressive strength of the material to be crushed is 320 MPa.
