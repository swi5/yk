## Big Dreams For Bornite Mine
As for Charles and Pat, they traveled through rugged lands not yet seen by white man. Upon their arrival at the headwaters of Clear Creek and Copper Creek they discovered a vein of ore called Bornite, a type of copper ore with a striking iridescent brownish-red color. By, there were big dreams to develop a tramway into this discovery

Introduction: bornite is an important ore of copper. It can occur as a primary mineral, for example in porphyry-copper deposits, or commonly as a supergene species occurring in the secondary enriched zones of copper ore bodies. Bornite is a distinctive mineral when fresh and unweathered and may be identified in hand specimen by its reddish-pink

Leaching Test. The variations of solution pH, ORP, copper extractions and cell concentration during leaching test of bornite were shown in Fig. 2.It was shown that the dissolution of bornite was an acid-consuming process [] and the solution pH increased faster in bioleaching which means that bioleaching consumed more acid than acid leaching in this test.

## Bornite: A mineral, an ore of copper, often called "peacock ore" - Geology
Bornite is easily recognized because it tarnishes to iridescent shades of blue, purple, red, green and yellow. It is commonly called "peacock ore" or "purple copper ore" after these iridescent colors. Upon surface exposure, bornite will weather to chalcocite or other copper minerals. Bornite is a popular and fast-selling mineral specimen at

## Bornite: Mineral information, data and localities.
Bornite is a copper(I) iron sulphide, with Fe likely predominantly being trivalent, although with some charge transfer likely possible (Goh et al. 2006). Substantial variation in the relative amounts of copper and iron occurs and solid solution extends towards chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and digenite (Cu9S5).

Although called bornite or chalcopyrite, peacock ore available for sale in the market is acid-treated chalcopyrite. It is rare to come across a naturally occurring peacock ore due to tarnishing of bornite, as this process takes several centuries to occur. Bornite is also relatively sketchily colorful and finally turns black.

Sep 10, 2020Bornite belongs to the mineral group of copper. It is a mineral of copper-iron sulfide. The crystal is usually available in two basic shades: brown and copper-red. The crystal can tarnish to dull shades of blue when exposed to open air. The color change is the reason the crystal got its name as peacock ore.

## Minerals | Free Full-Text | Mineralogical Properties of the Copper 
Annually, hundreds of thousands of tons of slags are involved in the reverberator and flash smelting as well as converting operations of Cu-Fe sulfide concentrates to produce matte in the Sar Cheshmeh copper smelter plant, Iran, disposed in the landfill and cooled in air. Due to their relatively high average copper content (about 1.5 wt%), a mineral processing plant based on the flotation

thought to be prevalent even in the presence of a collector obscuring the selectivity of the process. Leaching of the mixtures of bornite and chalcopyrite at mass ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and 3:1 are performed under various conditions to investigate the possible changes in leaching behaviour in relation to galvanic interactions.
