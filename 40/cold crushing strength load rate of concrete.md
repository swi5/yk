The crush strength is the load (similarly measured) at which a slab of specified thickness will begin to show breakup and crushing. There is a spread between these measures. Compressive strength of a particular concrete mix might be, say, 6000 pounds. That means it will be safe to put that much load onto the pad, repeatedly. The crush strength fo
