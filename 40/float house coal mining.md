## Characterization of airborne float coal dust emitted during continuous 
Float coal dust is produced by various mining methods, carried by ventilating air and deposited on the floor, roof and ribs of mine airways. If deposited, float dust is re-entrained during a methane explosion. Without sufficient inert rock dust quantities, this float coal dust can propagate an explosion throughout mining entries.

1. Introduction. The accumulation of float coal dust (FCD) with a diameter ≤ 74 µm poses an explosion hazard to all underground coal miners,, .These explosions typically occur when methane gas ignites and the resulting pressure wave re-entrains coal dust that was liberated by mining activities and has settled out of the ventilating air onto the floor, roof, and ribs of the mine entries.
