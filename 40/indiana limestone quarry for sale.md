Type locality and use of name: The name Salem Limestone was proposed by Cumings (1901) to replace the preoccupied name Bedford Limestone for rocks lying between the Harrodsburg Limestone (below) and the Mitchell Limestone (above). The abandoned term Mitchell corresponded closely to the present Blue River Group, of which the St&period; Louis Limestone is the bottom formation.
