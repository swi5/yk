## Diatomaceous earth - Sedimentary Rocks - Sandatlas
Diatomaceous earth. Diatomaceous earth or diatomite is a light-colored sedimentary rock composed chiefly of siliceous shells (frustules) of diatoms. Diatomaceous earth is a soft and friable rock. It leaves hands dusty if touched and has a fragile feel as if it has a delicate and light-weight internal structure. This feeling is not misleading.

## The Problem with Diatomaceous Earth as a Pesticide
Organic Does Not Mean Harmless Why Diatomaceous Earth Gets Recommended. 1) First, it's made from naturally occurring material, so it does check the organic box.But just because something is "organic" does not mean it is necessarily good or safe.. 2) And it's the physical—not chemical—properties of the particles that make it a pesticide—literally rubbing insects the wrong way

## What Is Diatomaceous Earth And How Does It Kill Bugs?
Diatomaceous earth has been used for years as an insecticide to control fleas. Step 1: Be sure the areas you are treating are completely dry, and that the room is well ventilated and free of family or pets during the treatment process. Step 2: Dust the affected areas (pet beds, blankets, surfaces of cat condos, etc.) with the diatomaceous earth using an applicator, or sock filled with the product.
