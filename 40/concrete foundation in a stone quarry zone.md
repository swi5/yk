## Stone Foundations - What, Why, and How - Ayers Basement Systems
That's why we recommend using Shotcrete to permanently repair stone foundations. Shotcrete is a sprayed application of concrete; after creating a steel mesh framework, shotcrete is applied to the existing walls with a high-pressure hose. This creates new concrete walls that bond to and replace the stone as the weight bearing, stable foundation.
