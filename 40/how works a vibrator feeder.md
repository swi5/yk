A series of coordinated vibrations from electromagnets produces a mechanical reaction that forwards the parts feeding process. A mounted bowl receives support from 4 to 5 leaf springs, restraining movement so that the bowl can only move vertically. A fixed magnetic coil under the bowl feeder magnetizes it to produce electromagnetic vibrations.

Air-powered feeders work best under hazardous conditions because they are driven by an air-cushioned piston vibrator, which produces smoother linear force and can work safely in high temperatures. It's the simplest of the three feeders to maintain and the controls are the most economical.

Since this design has the twin vibrators synchronizing to produce linear force, these feeders do not stop shaking immediately after power is turned off as the eccentric weights coast to a stop. A VFD with dynamic braking or a starter with a dynamic brake will end the vibration much more quickly to limit the erratic motion at shut down.

The concept of a vibratory feeder is actually quite simple. Here's how it works: Gravity determines where the materials will go. The flow of the material can either be angled straight down or in a spiral-like the ones in a bowl feeder. Vibration moves the material down the path where it will be processed or fed.

The vibratory feeder consists of a feed chute (which may be an open pan or closed tube) that is moved back and forth by the oscillating armature of an electromagnetic driver. The flow rate of the solids can be controlled by adjusting the current input into the electromagnetic driver of the feeder.

## Custom Built Vibratory Feeders | Contact Deca Vibrator Inc.
Deca vibratory feeders and conveyors utilize a special design to create smooth and efficient vibration and resonance at a predetermined frequency that is very close to the natural frequency of the application. This design reduces the horsepower requirements and creates even forces along the entire structure of the feeder/conveyor.

## How Vibratory Feeders Work: What Makes Them Efficient
The concept of a vibratory feeder is actually quite simple. Here's how it works: Gravity determines where the materials will go. The flow of the material can either be angled straight down or in a spiral like the ones in a bowl feeder. Vibration moves the material down the path where it will be processed or fed.

## How a Vibratory Bowl Feeder Works
When placed in the bowl along with a deburring media, like bits of triangular plastic or ceramic beads, the machine's vibration creates friction between the media and the parts, removing burrs and polishing and finishing the parts. Some of the machines also introduce water and a special liquid into the mix to aid in the finishing process.
