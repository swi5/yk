## how does the ball mill work
The ball mill work index laboratory test is conducted by grinding an ore sample prepared to passing 3.36 mm (6 mesh) to product size in the range of 45-150 µm ( mesh), thus determining the ball mill work index (Wi B or BWi). The work index calculations across a narrow size range are conducted using the appropriate laboratory work
