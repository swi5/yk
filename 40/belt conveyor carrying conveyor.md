Belt conveyors are the most economical method of transporting bulk materials over both short and long distances. Belt conveyors are ideal for conveying bulk materials of large lump size since the bulk materials stay stationary on the belt.

## Belt or Chain, Belt vs. Chain - Not Really - Dorner Conveyors
Another good application for chains are conveyor systems that requires curves. Because chain belts are more flexible they make curved systems easier. Chain belts can also carry much heavier loads than belt conveyors and deal better with a mass flow of products. Belt vs. Chain is not a good way of thinking when considering your conveyor application.
