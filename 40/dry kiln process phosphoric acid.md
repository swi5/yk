JDCPhosphate Inc. (Fort Meade, Fla.; ) has demonstrated its Improved Hard Process (IHP) for producing high-quality phosphoric acid, which not only avoids the production of phosphogypsum, but also enables the use of much lower-grade ores (13-14% phosphate content versus the 28% or more required for WAP).

## Crushing Plant in Mali
Phosphoric acid is usually produced by three commercial methods, including wet process, thermal process and dry kiln process. Among these three methods, wet process is the most common route. The phosphate first reacts with the recycled phosphoric acid from the process and then mixed with sulfuric acid as a leaching agent.

## Wet Process Phosphoric Acid Production | Vaisala
Phosphoric acid, H 3 PO 4, is produced from phosphate rock by wet process or thermal process. 80% of the world's phosphoric acid is obtained by the wet process. The wet process consists of reaction, filtration and concentration steps. The phosphate rock is ground and acidified with sulfuric acid in the reactor vessel.
