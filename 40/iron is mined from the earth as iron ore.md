Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two categories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines.  Diamonds and supplementary valuable and semi-precious gemstones are excavated from the earth level via 4 main types on mining. These diamond withdrawal methods

The Silver Pickaxe is an early-game pickaxe that is stronger than the Iron and Lead Pickaxes, but weaker than the Gold and Platinum Pickaxes. Compared to its alternate ore version, the Tungsten Pickaxe, it has less pickaxe power but is significantly faster in terms of mining speed. Unlike the Tungsten Pickaxe, it is not able to mine Meteorite.

4.1.1 Iron Ore Mining There are two basic methods of mining iron ore. These are: • Surface mining or open-pit mining • Underground or shaft mining To be competitive, iron mining must be done on a very large scale. Surface mining is the preferred choice, although there are exceptions. Small, low-capacity mines have rapidly disappeared.

## Iron Ore | The Canadian Encyclopedia
Iron is a common metal found in the earth's crust, where it occurs in combination with other elements. The term "iron ore" is used when the rock is sufficiently rich in iron minerals to be mined economically. Iron ore yields metallic iron (Fe) when heated in the presence of a reducing agent such as coke. Iron ore usually consists of iron oxides

Ore is a deposit in Earth's crust of one or more valuable minerals.The most valuable ore deposits contain metals crucial to industry and trade, like copper, gold, and iron.. Copper ore is mined for a variety of industrial uses. Copper, an excellent conductor of electricity, is used as electrical wire. Copper is also used in construction. It is a common material in pipes and plumbing material.

Bog iron is formed when ground-water picks up iron from iron-ore deposits, where that iron is then oxidized under acidic conditions to form chunks of iron minerals (goethite, magnetite, hematite, etc.), typically in smallish chunks.

## How Is Iron Ore Mined - Realonomics
What is iron mining? Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. Where is most iron ore mined?

There are 3 primary methods for extracting ore: Underground mining; Surface (open pit) mining; Placer mining ; Some materials are deep under the earth's surface, requiring rock drilling and blasting before materials arrive at the surface. Other ores are closer to the earth's surface, and mining can operate without digging far underground.

## How Is Iron Ore Mined From The Ground - Realonomics
Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined often via smelting to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains. How does iron ore get mined? Most iron ores are extracted by surface mining.Some underground mines do exist but wherever possible surface mining is preferred because it is cheaper.

## What is Iron Ore? - WorldAtlas
Hematite, the most desirable iron ore because of its high iron content, is found throughout the world, with its highest abundance being seen in Australia, Brazil, and parts of Asia. Since the 1960's, high-grade hematite ore has served as the major source of iron mined in Australia. It comprises 96% of the iron ore exports from that continent.
