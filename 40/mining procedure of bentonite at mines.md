Bentonite. Bentonite has been mined on Milos since 1952. The deposits occur almost exclusively in the northeast of the island. Here there are several active mines next to each other, including Imerys' Aggeria Mine, which has existed since 1985 and which is the biggest bentonite mine in Europe and one of the biggest in the world.

## Mining and processing | Bentonite
Bentonite production process features ore mining, sodium activation - if required -, drying, and milling. Sodium activation is performed to convert calcium bentonite to sodium bentonite, in which calcium ions are exchanged for sodium carbonate. Through drying, bentonite natural moisture content of about 25-35% is reduced.
