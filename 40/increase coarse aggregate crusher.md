The fine and coarse aggregates generally occupy 60% to 75% of the concrete volume (70% to 85% by mass) and strongly influ- ence the concrete's freshly mixed and hardened proper- ties, mixture proportions, and economy. Fine aggregates (Fig. 5-1) generally consist of natural sand or crushed stone with most particles smaller than 5 mm (0.2 in.).

Coarse aggregate (CA) refers to irregular and granular materials such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone used to make concrete. In most cases, Coarse is naturally occurring and can be obtained by blasting quarries or crushing them by hand or crushers. It is imperative to wash them before concreting.

## Coarse Aggregates in Construction | Types and Uses
Aggregates that cannot pass through the IS Sieve of 4.75mm are called coarse aggregates. They are crushed stones or naturally occurring gravel used in making concrete. Their maximum size can go up to 63mm. Coarse aggregates are usually formed by blasting the stone quarries. Though sometimes, they are also hand-crushed.

## Aggregate Equipment That Produces High-Quality Aggregates
Coarse and Fine Aggregate. Aggregates are classified into two types depending on their size: fine and coarse. Fine aggregate is 4.75mm or smaller as it can pass through a #4 sieve. Coarse aggregate is greater than 4.75mm and is retained by a #4 sieve. Fine aggregate is usually finely crushed stone, sand, silt, or clay.

## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3â4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3â4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.

It will help to increase the volume of the concrete and also reduces the cost of the project.  The crushing value of the coarse aggregate is defined as the relative measure of the resistance which is offered by the aggregate to the crushing under the gradually applied load.  Coarse aggregate can be described as uncrushed,
