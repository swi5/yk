## Gem Silica: The blue, most valuable variety of chalcedony - Geology
Gem silica is a rare bluish green to greenish blue chalcedony that is colored by copper. It is the most valuable variety of chalcedony.  As a variety of chalcedony, gem silica has a Mohs hardness of 7 and is durable enough for use in almost any jewelry design. Yet, gem silica is rarely seen in jewelry. The gem is rare, costly, and the supply

## Hydrated silica
Hydrated silica is a form of silicon dioxide, which has a variable amount of water in the formula.When dissolved in water it is usually known as silicic acid.It is found in nature, as opal (which has been mined as a gemstone for centuries), and in the cell walls of diatoms.It is also manufactured for use in toothpaste.Hydrated silica can be dehydrated to produce silica gel [citation needed

Safety Information: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits Silica to be directly added to food as an anticaking agent.It is also permitted as an indirect food additive as a component of filters and polyester resins. Aluminum Calcium Sodium Silicate (as sodium calcium aluminosilicate, hydrated) is considered Generally Recognized as Safe as anticaking agent in food.

## Hydrated Silica - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The hardness of tooth stain is affected by the type of stain, age of stain and other factors [110]. The commonly used dentifrice abrasives such as silica and calcium carbonate have hardness values between that of dentine and enamel [110]. Abrasive particle shape can vary considerably from rounded smooth particles to sharp angular particles.

The hardness test developed by friedrich mohs was the first known test to assess resistance of a material to scratching. it is a very simple but inexact comparative test. perhaps its simplicity has enabled it to become the most widely used hardness test. since the mohs scale was developed in 1812, many different hardness tests have been invented.

Mild abrasives in toothpaste are used to break up plaque and debris. This grit is usually hydrated silica. The level of abrasiveness depends on the size and shape of these particles. Whitening toothpastes, for example, are highly abrasive and should be avoided. They are not effective at whitening, and they can cause damage to your teeth and gums.

## What Is Silica?: Fumed Silica and Precipitated Silica
Silica is a compound used in many applications. For instance, as glassmaking or even toothpaste. But there are two different types of silicas: precipitated and fumed. Precipitated silica has been around longer than fumed. However, both compounds have unique properties. This blog post will compare the differences between these two types of silicas.

## Opal
Opal is a hydrated amorphous form of silica (SiO 2 ·nH 2 O); its water content may range from 3 to 21% by weight, but is usually between 6 and 10%. Due to its amorphous property, it is classified as a mineraloid, unlike crystalline forms of silica, which are considered minerals.It is deposited at a relatively low temperature and may occur in the fissures of almost any kind of rock, being most
