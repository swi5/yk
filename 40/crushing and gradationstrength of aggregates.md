Greater is the aggregate crushing value, softer is the aggregate sample and vice versa. This is suggestive of the fact that the resistance of aggregates to crushing is less. Therefore, the strength of such a sample is also less. Aggregates having relatively less ACV can be used in wearing surfaces of pavements. 2)Hardness

## Aggregates - Cement
Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. After harvesting, aggregate is processed: crushed, screened, and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.
