Where the material is not reduced sufficiently in the primary crusher, it is then crushed by a secondary crusher to achieve the correct size of the material. Wear on parts of the crushers affect the performance and volume of material being crushed, the parts subject to high impact, and abrasive wear include the hammers, rotors, teeth, and mantles.

A cone crusher can crush a variety of rocks, from medium to hard. The way a cone crusher operates is similar to how a gyratory crusher does, but in a cone crusher the slope in the breaking space is not as steep. Although it is known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, the cone crusher is better suited for secondary crushing.

## Secondary & Tertiary Crushing Circuits - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The coarse material will be crushed by the secondary crusher. The fines will be taken out of the circuit. Once the secondary has finished with the ore it will be reclassified by a second set of screens with the oversize going to the tertiary crusher. The discharge of the tertiary is reintroduced to the screen deck to ensure that the ore size is

## What Is Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Crushing?
Secondary crushing, as you can imagine, is the second stage of material processing following its initial reduction. At this stage, material will flow through perhaps a second impactor crusher or even a cone crusher, which is effective at breaking down these types of material. There are also tertiary and even quaternary stages of crushing that
