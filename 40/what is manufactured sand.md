Although the name may imply that manufactured sand is actually a synthetic material, this type of sand still comes from natural stones. A production company will work to smash and crush rocks into small sand particulates. Once these particulates are small enough, they are then washed and grated to be used in construction applications.

Manufactured sand (M-Sand) is used as a substitution to the river sand in construction. River sand is becoming a decaying resource in some parts of the year due to the lack of rains to collect the sand on the river beds. Manufactured sand can be considered as a by-product of the process of producing coarse aggregates.
