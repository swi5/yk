## What is the Difference between Impact Crusher and Cone Crusher?
A, The cone crusher is slightly more expensive than the impact crusher, but the cone crusher has relatively lower energy consumption, more stable production, longer service life of its wearing parts, avoid the need for frequent downtime maintenance and spare parts replacement. B, Although the early purchase cost of impact crusher machine is low

## Cone Crusher vs. Impact Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.
