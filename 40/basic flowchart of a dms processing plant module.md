## Consider Modular Plant Design | AIChE
A modular plant can be comprised of many unit operations contained on a single skid or on multiple skids that are connected at the production site to form a large process system. The modules are shipped to the manufacturing site, where they are erected and integrated in the final orientation. Once at the end-user's facility, the units can be

## Dense-Heavy Medium Separation HMS / DMS Process
HMS and DMS are acronyms for Heavy (Dense) Medium Separation and is applied to the process of pre-concentration of minerals - mainly the production of a high weight, low assay product, which may be rejected as waste. In principle it is the simplest of all gravity processes and is a standard laboratory method for separating minerals of different specific gravity.
