Eventually the plywood will buckle & delaminate without anything. I'd probably do rain screen on the sides with a lightweight siding, like cedar. For the roof for something quick and easy just peel n stick blueskin moisture barrier, hung just over the siding, then a cap around the top of the siding.

## Can we make concrete using quarry dust as a replacement for sand 
1)- Workability - It is defined as the ease with which we can work with concrete. So when we use quarry sand in concrete, due to its heavy weight it reduces the workability of concrete. 2)- Mixing - Due to its heavy weight and large particles, it doesn't mix properly in concrete. 3)- Price- Price of quarry sand is lower than price of river sand.

## Quikreteurfussball-essen
Quikrete Concrete Mix is the original 4000 PSI average compressive strength blend of Portland cement, sand and gravel or stone. Just add water. Use for any general concrete work.Find the CONCRETE HISTRGTH 80# at Ace. 4. KwikWood. For strong repairs in a hurry, this product is the best. Anyone who occasionally needs to patch wood should have a tube of this sitting in their shop or garage.

It is observed that the slump value increases with increase in percentage replacement of sand with quarry dust for the same w/c ratio. Concrete does not give adequate

##  Vol. 4, Issue 1, January 2015 Behaviour of Concrete on Replacement of 
In order to study the strength behaviour and fire resistance of the concrete made with full replacement of sand with Quarry stone dust the tests are conducted. Results so obtained for the tests conducted on cubes and prisms for M25 and M40 grades of concrete with various dosages of super plasticiser at 7days and 28 days were tabulated. The
