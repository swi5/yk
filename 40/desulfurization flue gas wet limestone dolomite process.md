3.2.2.3 Furnace sorbent injection systems. Another dry FGD technology that was developed in the 1970s and 1980s involves injection of limestone or hydrated lime into the upper furnace; this process is often called furnace sorbent injection, or FSI. The injected sorbent is collected along with the fly ash in the existing ESP or fabric filter.

A scrubbing process for flue gas desulfurization, based upon naturally occurring carbonate rocks, has been developed from laboratory to pilot plant scale. Calcitic limestones are better sulfur dioxide absorbents than dolomitic ones when used in the slurry form. The process was tested on a 200-cfm pilot plant on a coal-fired boiler.

Flow optimisation is therefore extremely necessary. In the mist eliminator, the drops carried from the absorption zone by the flue gas, are returned to the process. At the outlet of the absorber, the clean gas is saturated and can be directly removed via a cooling tower or wet stack. Optionally the clean gas can be heated and routed to a dry stack.

FLUE GAS DESULFURIZATION BY MECHANOCHEMICALLY . for the necessary Flue Gas Desulfurization FGD treatment in order to meet stringent SO 2 emission limits FGD wet dry or semi dry is an expensive energy intensive process due to its overall poor efficiency and to the need of using finely micronized CaCO 3 Wet FGD laboratory tests with dolomite slurry have shown that up to ≈ 50 higher

## Limestone-based wet flue gas desulfurization process
A wet flue gas desulfurization process comprising the steps of: (a) bringing a sulfur-containing flue gas into contact with an aqueous limestone-containing slurry which includes a limestone-dissolution rate enhancing effective amount of ammonium ions in an absorber; (b) forcing oxidation air into the absorber so as to oxidize sulfite therein to

## Flue Gas Desulfurization | Yokogawa India
In the absorber, a mixture of water and pulverized limestone is sprayed on the flue gas. The limestone slurry absorbs the sulfur dioxide (SO 2) contained in the flue gas reducing the emission of sulfur. The limestone reacts with the SO 2 to produce calcium sulfite. The calcium sulfite then reacts with oxygen and is then finally removed as gypsum.
