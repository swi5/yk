## Effect of Aggregate Size on Strength - Concrete Construction
A.: If the quantities of coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, cement and water are the same for both mixes, the mix with l l/2-inch aggregate will have greater slump and will probably bleed more. If both mixes are plastic the resulting strengths of the two mixes will probably be about the same. If, however, the two mixes are designed for the same

## Aggregate in Concrete - Concrete Network
Aggregates are generally thought of as inert filler within a concrete mix. But a closer look reveals the major role and influence aggregate plays in the properties of both fresh and hardened concrete. Changes in gradation, maximum size, unit weight, and moisture content can all alter the character and performance of your concrete mix.
