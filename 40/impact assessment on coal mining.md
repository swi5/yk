## Environmental and socio-economic impacts of coal mining
Jan 21, 20224 Conclusion. Mining has a tremendous impact on the economic, social, and environmental fabric of the surrounding area. Mining activities contribute to economic development in the area, but they also degrade the land, causing ecological and socio-economic issues. Mining harms the ecology as a whole.

Mining is the extraction of minerals and other geological materials of economic value from deposits on the Earth. Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes.
