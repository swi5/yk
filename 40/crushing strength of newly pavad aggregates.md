## crushing strength test on aggregates
A test is standardized by IS:2386 part-IV and used to determine the crushing strength of aggregates. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under gradually applied crushing load. The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4.

## Web crushing strength of reinforced and prestressed concrete beams 
The web crushing strengths of 16 reinforced and prestressed concrete I-beams are reported. The principal variables of the test specimens are the ratio of yield force in the prestressed steel to yield force in the nonprestressed steel and the area of vertical stirrups. The test strengths are compared with the upper limit on shear strength given by ACI Building Code, the Australian and Canadian

## Compressive strength
The compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test, there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence, for this region, =, where, this time, E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region, the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.

## Definition of crushing strength
It is measured by applying graduated pressure to a cube, 1 in (2.54 cm) square, of the rock tested. A crushing strength of 4,000 lb means that a cubic inch of the rock withstands pressure to 4,000 lb (111 kg/cm 3 ) before crushing. The crushing strength is greater with shorter prisms and less with longer prisms. Ref: Fay ii.

## crushing strength of newly pavad aggregates
Jun 19, 2016· To Determine Crushing Strength of given Aggregate- Concrete Practical. Aggregate is a granular material, such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, crushed hydraulic-cement concrete, or iron blast-furnace slag, used with a hydraulic cementing medium to produce either concrete or mortar.

## Strength of Coarse Aggregates.np
Tests on prepared rock samples are little used, but the average value of crushing strength of such samples is about 200 MPa, although many excellent aggregates range in strength down to 80 MPa.
