Open cast mining is used to extract coal from shallow depts. It's a more efficient process than underground mining, the latter needing high technical expertise and greater investments. In India, most of the coal production comes from open-cast mines As on 2015, the share of underground coal mining in India is lowest- only 8.8% of the total mining.

## Surface mining advantages and disadvantages
Traditional forms of mining can be unsafe for workers. Fires and collapses can be deadly, and the health effects of mining can be devastating. Others, however, object to mining in general. Because coal and oil release carbon dioxide when used as fuel, some argue that mining exacerbates global warming. Others object to >mining for the rare Earth.
