## Assaying Antimony Determination Method - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The determination of metallic antimony in an ore is made either by fusion with potassium cyanide or by fusion with iron, as in the galena assay. Both methods yield poor results ; and, where iron is used, it must be added in quantity only sufficient for desulphurising; this amounts to about 40 per cent, in pure ores.

Antimony, the 51st element on the periodic table (symbol: Sb), is a shiny, silver-gray metal that has been used by mankind for millennia. Relatively rare, it is sometimes found as a base metal, but more often occurs bound to other elements in one of up to 100 mineral compounds. The most common of these is the sulfide stibnite (Sb₂S₃), which

Antimony alloys are therefore used in making typefaces for clear, sharp printing. Babbit metals, used for machinery bearings, are alloys of lead, tin, copper and antimony. These metals are hard but slippery and so ideal for use as bearings. (8) Antimony is used in the semiconductor industry as an n-type dopant for silicon.

Antimony can also cause problems with the lungs, heart, and stomach. Workers may be harmed from exposure to antimony and its compounds. The level of exposure depends upon the dose, duration, and work being done. Antimony is used in many industries. It is used to make flame-proofing materials and in some paints, glass, and batteries.

## Antimony Recovery from End-of-Life Products and Industrial Process 
Antimony has become an increasingly critical element in recent years, due to a surge in industrial demand and the Chinese domination of primary production. Antimony is produced from stibnite ore (Sb2O3) which is processed into antimony metal and antimony oxide (Sb2O3). The industrial importance of antimony is mainly derived from its use as flame retardant in plastics, coatings, and electronics

Antimony is often found in other ores as well, e.g., silver, copper, and lead. The pure element antimony is produced from the ore by roasting it to form the oxide, then reducing the oxide with carbon or iron; often a flux of sodium sulfate or sodium carbonate is used to prevent loss of molten antimony by evaporation.
