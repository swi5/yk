## Dropwise cooling crystallization of ammonium perchlorate in gas-liquid 
Ammonium perchlorate is an important oxidizer in solid rocket propellants, underwater explosives and pyrotechnics. The crystal quality of ammonium perchlorate has an important impact on its application in these fields. In this work, a dropwise cooling crystallization method was proposed to crystallize ammoni

Ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP) is a modern fuel used in solid-propellant rocket vehicles. It differs from many traditional solid rocket propellants such as black powder or zinc-sulfur, not only in chemical composition and overall performance but also by the nature of how it is processed.APCP is cast into shape, as opposed to powder pressing as with black powder.

Synonyms: Perchloric acid ammonium salt Description: Ammonium perchlorate is an oxidiser used in a large number of compositions. Very impressive colour compositions can be made with it, but their burn rate is often too low for use in star compositions. For lance work and torches slow burning is an advantage and it is therefore commonly used in these items. Ammonium perchlorate is also used in

Dec 28, 2020Ammonium perchlorate (AP) is one of the important components of the CMDB propellant, which has been extensively employed as an oxidizer. AP-based composite modified double-based (AP-based CMDB) propellants are currently the most widely used propellants owing to their advantages of the high energy and fast burning rate [ 7 - 11 ].

## Prediction of Particle Size of Ammonium Perchlorate during 
Ammonium perchlorate has been pulverised by an impact mill (air classifier mill) to studythe influence of different operating parameters, viz., effect of mill speed, classifier speed, feedrate, and damper opening (suction rate) on the particle size. Further based on the differentgrinding parameters, an empirical equation has been developed and used for the prediction ofparticle size.

## Preparing perchlorates - PyroGuide - PyroData
If chlorate was properly destroyed, and a qualitative test indicates so, ammonium perchlorate may be prepared. 1. If potassium perchlorate is the intended product, take 70 grams of potassium chloride for every 100 grams of sodium chlorate that was started with and dissolve this in the smallest volume of water possible. If instead ammonium

## A vacuum ultraviolet photoionization study on the thermal decomposition 
Abstract. Pyrolysis products of ammonium perchlorate (NH 4 ClO 4) at 483 K were monitored on line and in situ via single photon photoionization reflectron time-of-flight spectrometry (PI-ReTOF-MS) in the photon energy range of 9.00-17.50 eV.The photoionization efficiency curves (PIE) of the subliming product molecules were collected and allowed for detection of three class of products
