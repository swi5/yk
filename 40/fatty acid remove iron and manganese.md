## The Kinetics of Iron and Manganese Removal - Master Water
Iron is the 4th most abundant element in the earth's crust and comprises around 5% of it, while manganese is around 0.1%. Iron and manganese bearing bedrock formations are dissolved into groundwater typically from the presence of free CO2. Iron concentrations in groundwater typically range from 0-10.0 mg/L, but 20 mg/L or higher are not uncommon.

## Lesson 8: Using Filtration for Removal of Iron and Manganese
In general, manganese oxidation is more difficult than iron oxidation because the reaction rate is slower. A longer detention time (10 to 30 minutes) following chemical addition is needed prior to filtration to allow the reaction to take place. There are different filtration media for the removal of iron and manganese, including manganese

## Use of potassium permanganate for iron and manganese removal from acid 
The best way to remove manganese is by chemical oxidation. A common treatment method is pH adjustment with lime or soda ash. This practice neutralizes the acid and removes most of the iron by forming an insoluble precipitate. The amount of lime or soda ash needed to remove manganese raises the pH beyond the acceptable range of 6-9.
