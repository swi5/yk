## Mineral hydration
In chemistry, mineral hydration is an inorganic chemical reaction which adds water to the crystal structure of a mineral, usually creating a new mineral, usually called a hydrate.. In geological terms, the process of mineral hydration is known as retrograde alteration and is a process occurring in retrograde metamorphism.It commonly accompanies metasomatism and is often a feature of wall rock

##  Partial Replacement of Fly Ash Based Geopolymer Concrete With Copper 
In India 8 lakhs tons of copper slag is generated every year and in world-wide generation of annually about 24.8 million tons of copper slag. Which is produce during the copper smelting process. In this study we investigated that the constructive use of copper slag as a replacement to fine aggregate. Copper slag

## Copper Slag in Concrete As Replacement Material
Copper slag is an industrial by-product material produced during the process of manufacturing of copper. About 2.2 tonnes of copper slag is generated, for every ton of copper production. The primary objective of this paper is to study the application of copper slag as an alternative replacement material of sand. This paper also studies the effect of replacement of Fine aggregate with copper

concrete in which copper slag was used. In this study fine aggregate was replaced in four different proportion i.e. 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% by copper slag. M 25 grade concrete was taken and the mechanical properties were assessed by conducting a series of tests on the 28th day of curing. Following were the results achieved from the study:
