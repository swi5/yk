Modern, dry-process cement plants with efficient configuration of grinding and pyro processing systems typically consume less than 700 kcal/kg-cl thermal energy and 100 kWh/mt of electrical energy. Older plants have inefficient systems, which compounded with operational and maintenance inadequacies, tend to have much higher energy consumption.
