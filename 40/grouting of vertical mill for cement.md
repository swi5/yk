## Fill voids and cracks with pressure injection grouting - Superior Grouting
Superior Grouting is an established pressure grout company that has been resolving these issues since 1983. In addition to generalized pressure grouting in concrete, it also performs newer forms of grouting including cellular concrete fill and polyurethane injection. Common industrial and commercial uses for pressure injection grouting include:

But unlike grout, concrete also has coarse aggregate sand and stone. This makes it much grittier and porous which means it absorbs water and is a pore sealant. Just like grout, concrete starts as a dry powder, but when mixed with water the cement activates and becomes hard during a process called curing. This can take 28 days to complete.

Put the tip of the bag in the space between the bricks at a 45 degree angle. Twist the end of the bag and squeeze as you move the tip along the gap.

Where a concrete floor slab is adjacent to the mill foundations, an expansion joint should be used.  In most instances the disintegration starts between the sole plate and the top surface of the grouting near or at the vertical centerline of the mill. As this continues, the weight of the mill causes the sole plate and trunnion bearing base
