## How To Extract Iron From Sand or Iron Ore To Make Wrought Iron
Yes, it is possible to extract iron from sand or from some rocks. To do so you have two really good options. You can use Black Sand or Iron Ore. First, let's concentrate on sand. Typically dark grey or blackish sand will have higher iron content than whiter sand. Dark brown sand doesn't mean there will be more iron than white sand.
