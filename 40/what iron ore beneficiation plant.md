## Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation - IspatGuru
Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.
