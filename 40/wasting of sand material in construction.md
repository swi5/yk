## Material Handling and Waste Management at a Construction Site
You can separate the waste including concrete and aggregate, soil and sand, wood materials, brick and blocks, roofing, plastic, and packaging materials. You can ensure minimization by reusing and recycling of construction waste materials on site. In general you can expect to recycle and reuse 45% of the waste materials and that is a big saving.

## The Use of Waste Materials in the Construction Industry
Abstract Waste materials are a major environmental problem, which is a threat to the environment. It is important to reuse these materials and dispose of them. Waste can be used in the construction industry in two ways: by reusing (reuse components) and recycling (processing waste into raw materials used in the production of building materials).

Waste glass aggregate is angular in shape and has a smooth feel. It is tough, but also fragile and brittle (Chen et al, 2006; Taha and Nounu, 2008).Recycling waste glass and turning it into fine aggregate for concrete production reduces landfill space and the demand for natural raw materials in the construction sector (Rakshvir and Barai, 2006).In a study by Ibrahim (2017), it was discovered

The recycled sand obtained from industrial operations can also be utilized in construction activities. Many industries generate waste sand as a byproduct. The material generated from this discarded molds and cores is usually known as "used foundry sand," "waste foundry sand," or "spent foundry sand.".

## New study shows that plastic waste can replace sand in concrete 
Authored by: TheCivilEngineer. According to researchers from Bath University, waste plastic can replace some of the sand used in concrete. This change could lead to an environmental friendly solution in construction industry.

## Use of waste material in Civil Engineering Construction
Waste (or wastes) is undesirable or useless materials. "Waste is any substance which is dumped after main use or is useless, faulty and of no use. A by-product by contrast is a joint output of relatively low economic worth. A waste product may become a by-product, joint product or resource by an invention that elevates a waste product's worth

This research is carried out to produce a low-cost and eco-friendly concrete. This paper demonstrates the use of waste foundry sand as a partial replacement by fine aggregate in concrete. An

After several cycles, it becomes unsuitable for the industry and pile up as a waste material, called foundry sand. The total production of this waste sand is about 3 million tons annually. Fox and Mast (1998) revealed that foundry sand may be used as an embankment construction and its performance is comparable to conventional soil.
