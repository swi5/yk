## Common Jaw Crusher Injuries, and How to Avoid Them
While the jaw crusher has become increasingly safe in recent years, it is arguably one of the most dangerous pieces of equipment at the plant. Regardless of whether you are doing ground work or actually operating a jaw crusher, it is essential you take the steps to keep you and the crew safe. These steps can be the difference between a mundane

## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing

## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.

"Successful jaw crusher maintenance requires the right resources, the right tools and the right approach," says Bill Macini, a Telsmith service technician. Certainly when an operation is down, whether for preventive maintenance or component failure, there is always the pressure to get the plant up and running as soon as possible.

## Crushers: Breaking Down the History of these Machines
A gyratory crusher was patented by Philetus W. Gates in 1881. Thomas A. Edison also designed a rock crusher to use in his own mining operation. Edison's design used giant rolls to function as a primary crusher. These machines never gained much popularity though because the gyratory and jaw crushers were more versatile.

The steam shovel began to change the entire picture of open-pit working.With the steam shovel came the really ''huge" No. 8 crusher, with its 18″ receiving opening. Up to this time the jaw crusher had kept pace with the gyratory, both from the standpoint of receiving opening and capacity, but now the gyratory stepped into the leading position, which it held for some 15 years.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## The History of Jaw Crushers and Cone Crushers
The first cone crusher was developed by the Symons brothers to improve secondary and tertiary crushing applications. While jaw crushers provide excellent primary crushing duties, new ways of crushing needed to be devised for finer and more consistently sized aggregates. In 1920, the Symons brothers created the first cone crusher.

## Jaw Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.
