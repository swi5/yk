## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics - ThoughtCo
History . Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore, leaving behind a soft, malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.
