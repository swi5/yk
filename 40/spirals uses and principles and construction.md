Advantages and Disadvantages: 1. Spiral of Silence theory has both micro level and macro level explanatory process. 2. It works well during the public campaign, Senate and Parliament. 3. Spiral of silence theory - which helps to raise question about considering the role and responsibility of media in the society. 4.

A mountain aster may have 13 spirals to the left and 21 to the right. Sunflowers are the most spectacular example, typically having 55 spirals one way and 89 in the other; or, in the finest varieties, 89 and 144. Pine cones are also constructed in a spiral fashion, small ones having commonly with 8 spirals one way and 13 the other.

However, approaching design and construction as one integrated process from the beginning can avoid tension. Design-build is a project delivery method by which the designer and contractor work together in a unified workflow from concept through completion. With this method, the contractor is more likely to fully realize the architect's vision

## The Art of Symmetry in Architecture - Jonite®
Spiral or helical symmetry can be categorised as a unique form of similarity symmetry. Helixes and spirals often communicate continuity in architecture. This is manifested in spiral staircases whereby the entire form denotes a sense of flow in the space from one level to another throughout the building. Frank Lloyd Wright incorporated the helix

For the prediction and understanding of magnetic structures from first-principles calculations, a systematic investigation of magnetic interactions like exchange or the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) is crucial. The determination of the MCA requires relativistic (often collinear) total energy calculations.

A spiral is a curve in the plane or in the space, which runs around a centre in a special way. Different spirals follow. Most of them are produced by formulas. You can make a spiral by two motions of a point: There is a uniform motion in a fixed direction and a motion in a circle with constant speed.

A coil springs is a piece of bar that has been twisted to form the shape of a helix ( spiral ). It works in an up and down motion as a spring by using the vertical displacement to twist the bar making the spring.
