## Who water mill invented?mys
A water mill is a water wheel or turbine that is connected to a device that drives a mechanical process. Water mills can be used for such purposes as grinding flour or agricultural produce, cutting up materials such as pulp or timber, or metal shaping. How did a water mill work?

## Why was the water mill invented? Explained by FAQ Blog
The invention of the water mill started with the Perachora wheel, which used both the water wheel and the gear technology that had already been invented. It was invented in around the 3rd Century BC and Philo of Byzantium made the earliest known reference of it in his works, the Pneumatica and Parasceuastica.

## What Exactly Are Water Mills Employed For? - ScienceBriefss
Sep 22, 2021Sawmills - Water mills harness kinetic energy from moving bodies of water (usually rivers or streams) in order to drive machinery and generate electricity. The movement of the water drives the water wheel, which in turn powers a mechanical process within the mill itself. The most common mechanical process historically associated with water mills is grinding grains into flour.

## Watermill
A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses hydropower.It is a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering.Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. These watermills may comprise gristmills, sawmills, paper mills

## Water wheels, pumps and recirculatin mills
Normal mills need a continous water flow to power their water wheel. The basic idea of the recirculation mill is the usage of a a closed water system. Such machines sometimes are called dry water mills. Since the water does not come from external sources, it was called aqua morta i.e. "dead water". The intended advantage of this mill is clear.

## Water wheel
A water wheel is a machine for converting the energy of flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill.A water wheel consists of a wheel (usually constructed from wood or metal), with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving car. Water wheels were still in commercial use well into the 20th century but they are no longer in common use.

The water wheel retained immense industrial importance long after the invention of the steam engine. From the sixteenth until well into the nineteenth century, water wheels were the most important sources of power in Europe and North America. For example, London pumped its water supply from the river using water wheels until as recently as 1822.

## Water Mills and Wheels - Tide Mill Institute
Water Wheel Evolution. There are many wheel configurations, vane/blade shapes and water-flow patterns. Undershot wheels and horizontal wheels were the most common choices for tide mills. Since the height of the impoundment area was the height of high tide, the head of water was probably not high enough to power an overshot wheel.

## Water Wheels - Outdoor Revival
Some water wheels have a double row of buckets, side by side, to increase the overall size. A larger diameter wheel also allows for more buckets and increases force in that way. A larger wheel also increases the leverage that the water's weight has, as the wheel works on the principle of the lever. In this lever, the axle is the fulcrum.

In theory, if attached to a generator, water wheels can be used to produce electricity. However, they are not seen as the most efficient way to do so. The reason water wheels are not a great source of power is that they are large and cumbersome and so do not rotate rapidly enough to generate much energy. If done correctly however, a well-placed

According to an ancient text, in 31 AD the engineer Tu Shih "invented a water-powered reciprocator for the casting of [iron] agricultural implements." Smelters and casters were "instructed to use the rushing of water to operate their billows." Waterpower was also applied at an early date to grinding grain.

The waterwheel was seen as the most important power source in the world, from the Middle Ages to the end of the nineteenth century.

A watermill or water mill is a mill that utilizes hydropower. It is a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. These watermills may be comprise gristmills, sawmills

What were water wheels used for in China? The ancient Chinese needed power for their machines and their jobs, including smelting iron and irrigation for farmers. About 2,000 years ago, they began to use water wheels to provide power or transport water. This replaced the only other sources of power prior to electricity - people and animals.
