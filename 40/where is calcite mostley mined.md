Calcite is a carbonate mineral, currently used as a decorative block. Calcite drops as an item if mined by any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Calcite generates naturally as part of the structure of amethyst geodes, between the smooth basalt and block of amethyst layers. It also generates in the stony peaks in strips. Calcite is currently used only for decoration. Java

Description: Calcite is an abundant mineral found in many geological environments. It forms by precipitation from ground and surface waters, forming the major component of marls and limestone in the ocean, lakes and rivers. It also forms speleothemes in caves, euhedral crystals in vugs, and tufa where springs emerge on the surface.
