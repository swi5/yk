## Mining and Water Pollution — Safe Drinking Water Foundation
3. Processing Chemicals Pollution. This kind of pollution occurs when chemical agents (such as cyanide or sulphuric acid used by mining companies to separate the target mineral from the ore) spill, leak, or leach from the mine site into nearby water bodies. These chemicals can be highly toxic to humans and wildlife. 4.

The consequences of this over-exploitation of mineral wealth have to be serious, drastic and enormously damaging to the entire biosphere. These can be summed up as follows: 1. Rapid Depletion of High Grade Mineral Deposits: Exploitation of mineral wealth at a rapid rate shall naturally deplete our good quality deposits.

## Environmental Problems of Mining Waste Disposal Sites in Russia
Mining industry is one of the most extensive anthropogenic factors influencing and changing the environment. According to the generalized data by Smyslov et al. (), the mineral resources consumption was relatively low before the beginning of the twentieth century.Since the middle of the twentieth century, the scale of the environmental impact has risen consequently.

## 33 Causes, Effects & Solutions for Mining - E&C
One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.

Unrefined materials are released when mineral deposits are exposed on the surface through mining. Wind erosion and nearby vehicular traffic cause such materials to become airborne. Lead, arsenic, cadmium, and other toxic elements are often present in such particles. These pollutants can damage the health of people living near the mining site.
