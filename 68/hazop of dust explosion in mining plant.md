Pressurization utilizes compressed air or inert gas to protect equipment within an enclosure. The pressurization control system will regulate and monitor a positive pressure within the enclosure to prevent the dust from entering the enclosure. By separating the ignition source from the combustible dust atmosphere, the hazard can be minimized.

Coal Dust What Is It And Why Is It Dangerous. Apr 13, the risk of explosions. the dangers of coal dust extend beyond those related to exposure. coal dust suspended in the air is also highly explosive and very susceptible to spontaneous combustion because it has more surface area per unit weight. coal dust is the leading cause of many of the world's worst mining accidents. government.

## Dust Collectors | Questions On The Risk of Fires & Explosions
Dust collectors are used both as collection and receiving vessels for solid dust. They separate dust from an air stream by using an array of filter bags or filter cartridges. These usually collect the finest and therefore the most easily ignited dust in a process. According to FM Global, about 50% of dust explosions occur in the dust collector.

## Introduction to Combustible Dust Explosions Common to Baghouses
Many materials which are commonly known to oxidize can generate a dust explosion, such as coal, sawdust. The dust can arise from activities such as transporting grain and indeed grain silos do regularly have explosions. Mining of coal leads to coal dust and flour mills likewise have large amounts of flour dust as a result of milling.

Potential dust-explosion hazards exist in approxi-mately 30,000 industrial plants in the United States; these plants employ about 1 million workers. The first recorded dust explosion occurred in a flour mill in Milwaukee, Wis., in 1860. Records of the National Fire Protection Association indicate that since then there have been 950 dust

risk of explosion. A closed dust layer of less than 1 mm in thickness may be sufficient for this. If no adequate measures are taken to pre-vent sources of ignition, then it may easily come to an explosion. The particular danger of dust explosions is, that the pressure wave gener-ated by the initial explosion causes whirling of neighbouring dust
