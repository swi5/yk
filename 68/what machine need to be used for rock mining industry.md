## We Need To Talk About Mining: Death, Dangers & Prevention - Howden
FACT: Although the mining industry employs only 1% of the global labour force, it generates 8% of all fatal accidents. Over the years mining has become much safer. Numerous measures have been, and are being, put in place to improve the safety of the miners and improve the environment in which they work.
