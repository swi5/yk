## Coal based power plant - SlideShare
A thermal power station is a power plant in which the prime mover is steam driven. Water when heated turns into steam which drives a steam turbine. After passing through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated. [Rankine cycle] Coal is used as a fuel to heat water in a coal based thermal power plant.

## Radioactive Wastes From Coal-fired Power Plants | US EPA
Radiation Facts. The process of burning coal at coal-fired power plants, called combustion, creates wastes that contain small amounts of naturally-occurring radioactive material. Coal is a fossil fuel used to produce power in the United States. Coal contains trace amounts of naturally-occurring radioactive elements.

## Capture of CO2 Emissions from Coal Fired Power Stations
Our Fossil fueled power stations produce the biggest percentage of carbon dioxide gas, emitting it straight to the atmosphere. The CO2 is formed when we burn a fossil fuel, Fuel + Air = Energy + CO2 + H2O. The amount of CO2 produced is proportional to the type of fossil fuel used, Coal -1.00T of CO2/MWh. Oil - 0.75T of CO2/MWh.

## 10 Most Toxic Ingredients Used In Coal, Oil and Gas Production
Fossil Fuel Sources: Oil, Coal and Gas. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are two primary examples of particle-forming air pollutants (particulate matter) from coal power plants. Particulate matter is known to contribute to serious health problems, including lung cancer and other cardiopulmonary mortality.
