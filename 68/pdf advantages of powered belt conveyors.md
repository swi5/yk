## Belts vs. Live Roller Conveyors: When to Use Each - Hytrol Blog
Rollers can be powered a number of ways: Belt-driven live roller conveyors use v-belts or flat conveyor belts supported with controlled pressure against the bottom of the rollers. Friction between the belt and roller causes the roller to turn when the belt is driven. Roll-to-roll driven conveyors utilize loops of chain from roller to roller in
