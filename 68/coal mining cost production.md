## Prices and costs - Coal 2020 - Analysis - IEA
The average FOB price for Australian prime coking coal in 2019 was about USD 176/t, a y-o-y drop of roughly 15%. In comparison, supply costs for coking coal decreased only slightly, indicating that the profitability of met coal production decreased. The supply cost curve for both high and low calorific thermal coal decreased from 2018 to 2019.

## Coal mining cost inflation to resume | CRU
Extremely high and volatile metallurgical coal prices since mid-2016 have, after 3-4 years of scrutiny on cost reduction, shifted the focus of the industry away from costs of production - with spot prices spiking to ~200% above average costs of the industry, as they have done twice in the last year or so, changes to operating costs have, inevitably, seemed of little importance.

## Understanding the operating costs of coal power: US example - Carbon 
The transportation costs depend on whether the coal is imported from the seaborne market or purchased domestically from a nearby mine. Transport costs vary from region to region and even plant to plant. Hard coal plants often buy their fuel from far away mines, while lignite plants are almost always located close to the mine.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit
