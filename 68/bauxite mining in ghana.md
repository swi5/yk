Feb 5, 2021Since the 1960s, Ghana planned to form an integrated bauxite and aluminium industry as part of its industrial development. The West African nation, which is the top gold mining country in Africa, is the continent's third-largest bauxite exporter with 1.4Mt in 2019 - down from 1.8Mt the previous year.

Campaigners, however, say mining bauxite is an even greater risk, as swathes of trees would have to be cut down and soil removed in the forest's upper reaches. Daryl Bosu, deputy national director of the environmental group A Rocha Ghana, said that could cause "big, big trouble".
