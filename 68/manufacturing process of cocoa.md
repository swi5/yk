Oct 9, 2020Cocoa butter forms about 50-57% of the cocoa beans and gives chocolate its characteristic melting properties. Cocoa powder or dry cocoa solids are obtained after a defatting process of chocolate liquor using a mechanical or a hydraulic press. It can be used in almost any food product as an ingredient or as a garnish.

## Manufacturing | Hershey's Chocolate
Manufacturing. Manufacturing is the next big step in coming closer to having a piece of chocolate. Once the cocoa beans have reached the Hershey's Company, they are ready to be made into cocoa butter and chocolate. The first steps are testing, cleaning and roasting. The cocoa beans are tested for any defects like insects and mold.

The extracted cocoa butter is used in the manufacture of eating chocolate, while the cocoa presscake is ground finely to form cocoa powder. For the liquor that will go on to become chocolate, the addition of cocoa butter will be the next step.

Manufacturing is the production of a product by processing raw materials. This is accomplished through human labor, the use of machinery and/or other tools and often a biological or chemical process. Manufacturing can be on a large scale, or it can make the pieces that are assembled to build automobiles, airplanes, household appliances and more.
