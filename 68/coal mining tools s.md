## Learn About Wyoming Coal Mining.
Coal. Wyoming, the nation's leading coal producer since 1986, provides about 40% of America's coal through the top 10 producing mines located in the Powder River Basin. Most Wyoming coal is sub-bituminous, which makes it an attractive choice for power plants because it has less sulfur and burns at around 8,400 to 8,800 BTUs per pound.

## Coal Mining in Appalachia - The Moonlit Road
Although life in the coal mining towns was a step up for the more impoverished Appalachian families, most found it to be a meager existence. Miners were typically paid $3-$5 a day for a 12-hour work day. Many young boys went into the mines with their fathers to perform "dead work" for which the miner wasn't paid.
