Beneficiation plant process: 1. The ore which contained rare minerals were sent into the crushers to crush until reach the desired granularity. 2. The crushed materials were sent into ball mill, then add the water to grinding the mill (or use dry ball mill), until become the pulp. 3. The pulp was sent into the magnetic separation or flotation

## Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation - IspatGuru
Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

## Iron Ore Grinding Costs Calculation
Iron ore is the key raw material for steel production enterprises. Generally, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% needs to be processed before smelting and utilization. After crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation, etc., iron is gradually selected from the natural iron ore.

## Magnetite Recovery in Coal Washing by High Gradient Magnetic  - EPA
The amount of magnetite retained would be much greater than it would be in its use as a secondary separator but it has been shown that HGMS separators can retain 80% or more of the solids in a 40% density stream of iron ore without plugging. Separation was achieved even at a high recovery level (96% Fe recovery).
