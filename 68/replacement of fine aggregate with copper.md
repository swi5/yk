Re: Hairline cracks in mortar joints. The best way to clean mortar out of joints for tuck pointing is a 4 1/2" angle grinder and 3/8" thick masonry blade. Mortar joints are typically 3/8", so a circular saw would take several passes. The little grinder is much lighter and easier to control, and costs around $90.

The objective of the present study is to utilize high volume copper slag (i.e. 100%) as a replacement to fine aggregate and partially replacing cement with Nano silica. The work is carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the fine aggregate is replaced with copper slag in different percentages of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%.

## Experimental Study on Concrete by Replacing Fine Aggregate Partially 
Replacement of copper slag in fine aggregates reduces the cost of making concrete. Replacement of copper slag increases the self weight of concrete specimens to the maximum of 15 to 25%. 25% addition of copper slag as fine aggregate in concrete gives more strength compare to 30% addition of copper slag as fine aggregate in concrete.

Stone resin is made by taking shards of stone, binding them with a strong adhesive and molding them in with a special resin. The resulting mixture is then capped with acrylic or other coatings to ensure that the surface and core is protected and scratch resistant. And, because it is made from resin, the material is much lighter than normal.
