## Iron in Drinking Water - Illinois
Iron can be a troublesome chemical in water supplies. Making up at least 5 percent of the earth's crust, iron is one of the earth's most plentiful resources. Rainwater as it infiltrates the soil and underlying geologic formations dissolves iron, causing it to seep into aquifers that serve as sources of groundwater for wells. Although present in drinking water, iron is seldom

## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Impacts of strip mining: Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.

## Magnetism
Magnetism is the class of physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which refers to the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive phenomena in other entities. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism.

Mining the metal from hard rock is pretty. Lithium mining accounts for less than 10% of freshwater usage and its brine extraction does not correlate with changes in either surface-water features or basin. The environmental impact of traditional mining methods and shipping is also catching the eyes of consumers.

Discoloration: If you have high iron levels in your water — usually 0.3 parts per million or more — the water may be a rusty red or brown color. Your water may still be safe to drink, but it will look less appealing. Staining: High concentrations of iron in home water will stain porcelain bathroom fixtures, laundry and dishes.

Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. The resulting chemicals in the water are sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can come out as solids to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage.

Iron mining in the Schefferville, Quebec, area has resulted in the disruption of some small surface drainage systems and the discharge of large amounts of pumped groundwater into them. Major ion concentrations in surface waters is controlled by the occurrence of the Denault (dolomite) formation, and little change is caused by the mining activities.
