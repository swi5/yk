## Minnesota Taconite Mining and Mesothelioma | Asbestos Exposure
Taconite was first discovered in the 1870's in Minnesota, yet at the time was thought to be useless because of the difficulty of extracting high grade iron from the rock. However a process was discovered in the 1940's that made mining taconite profitable and created an economic opportunity for those in the area.

## Mining in Minnesota | Minnesota DNR - Minnesota Department of Natural 
The taconite is crushed, processed into hard, marble-sized pellets, and shipped to steel mills. The taconite pellets are melted in blast furnaces and then blown with oxygen to make steel. Minnesota currently has seven operating taconite plants which make the pellets. About 44 million tons of taconite pellets were shipped from the state in 1996.
