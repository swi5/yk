## Detailed analysis of iron ore beneficiation process
Generally, the combined process of weak magnetic separation and flotation is used to recover iron, sulfide or apatite by flotation.Principle processes are divided into two types: weak magnetic separation-flotation and flotation-weak magnetic separation. The direction of conjoints of magnetite and sulfide in these two processes is different.

## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## Summary of Iron Ore Beneficiation Process and Technology (Ⅱ)
There are many mineral processing methods, and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods, magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.

The qualitative and quantitative evaluation of liberation of economic minerals and the level of contamination of the process products by waste components were carried out for the purpose of analysing the technology level and forecast its development directions.Concentration of intergrown particles into a separate product for the purpose of subsequent more efficient and selective liberation is

## Iron ore beneficiation technologies - GoodRich MAGMA
We offer dry beneficiation plants to up-grade the contaminated hematite iron ores. In the dry beneficiation process, iron ore is ground to 0-2 mm size. After screening, the fines are passed through a very high gauss rare earth magnetic separator (up to 8,000 gauss). A demo plant has been set up & experiments on many types of raw materials were
