## What are the 3 environmental impacts of mineral extraction?
What are the environmental impacts of mining iron ore? The mining of iron ore is highly energy intensive and causes air pollution in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from diesel generators, trucks and other equipment. The mining of iron ore also causes water pollution of heavy metals and acid that drains from the mines.

## Environmental Impact of Steel - The World Counts
Environmental impact of steel production Mining of iron ore. The main ingredient in the production of steel is iron ore mined from Earth. Over 2,000 million tons of iron ore is mined mined a year - about 95 percent is used by the steel industry. Iron ore is the world's third most produced commodity by volume - after crude oil and coal - and

## The environmental impacts of iron and steel industry: a life cycle 
Regarding the environmental impact on 'Mineral Extraction' (0.07%), one would expect to observe a higher impact considering the high amounts of iron ore consumed; but this was not the case. This could indicate that impact on mineral extraction was low in comparison to impacts that are directly associated with the production process of sinter.

By contrast, iron mining is less wasteful, with approximately 60 percent of the ore extracted processed as waste Da Rosa, 1997; Sampat, 2003. Disposing of such large quantities of waste poses tremendous challenges for the mining industry and may significantly impact the environment.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)Â·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO
