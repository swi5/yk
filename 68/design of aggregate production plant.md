Water-to-Cement Ratio and Aggregate Moisture Corrections. If the coarse aggregate has a moisture content of 1.5% we will instead need to batch about 1946 pounds of coarse aggregate per cubic yard of concrete (1917 lb/yd3  1.015 = 1946 lb/yd3). Similar calculations also apply to fine aggregate moisture adjustments.
