## Crushing in Mineral Processing
In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing.  The resulting Ai is used to predict crusher liner wear rates. The Compressive Strength of rocks is measured by crushing cylinder shaped (drill core) ore samples of 2â³ x 2â³ (51mm X 51mm). This techniques allows for a rock-to-rock relative comparison.

## Crushing Mineral Processing
The use of hammer mills is in the field of softer minerals, such as gypsum, barytes and limestone, and particularly where the presence of clay would most definitely exclude the use of crushing machines in which fracture of the mineral is effected by pressure. In this latter field in particular, the hammer mill is also used as a primary crusher.

## SBM Mineral Processing GmbH, Austria - Impact Crusher
This impact crusher achieves a high degree of reduction in size; for very fine end product sizes, however, we recommend installing a grinding track. Setting the gap is assisted hydraulically and thus easily adjustable. Depending on feed material and gap width, crushing capacity ranges of 110 t/h - 720 t/h are possible.
