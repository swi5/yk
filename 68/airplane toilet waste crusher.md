## Waste plastic crusher | PP PE flakes shredding equipment
A waste plastic crusher is a piece of independent equipment in the plastic recycling line. The belt conveyor will send the raw materials into the crusher, such as PP PE film, bags, barrels, etc. Then, the waste plastic crushing machine will cut the flakes into pieces, which is an important step in the PP PE flake recycling line.

## How toilet waste is disposed while in a plane
Spread the love. Many people think toilet waste is disposed from airplanes by throwing it out of the plane while still in the air. And yes this actually used to happen in the past. The toilets in earlier airplanes were primitive and direct and passengers simply hurled the waste contents out the window onto the unsuspecting world below.

## How Do Airplane Bathrooms Work? | EXECUTIVE FLYERS
How Do Airplane Bathrooms Work? When you flush a plane's toilet, a "trapdoor" in the base of the toilet opens up. The toilet's waste goes through this trapdoor and travels through pipes into a tank at the back of the plane. Waste remains in this tank until the plane is on the ground. When the plane is on the ground, trucks attach a hose
