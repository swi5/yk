## coal mining - Coal preparation | Britannica
Coal preparation. As explained above, during the formation of coal and subsequent geologic activities, a coal seam may acquire mineral matter, veins of clay, bands of rock, and igneous intrusions.In addition, during the process of mining, a portion of the roof and floor material may be taken along with the coal seam in order to create adequate working height for the equipment and miners.

## Coal mining and transportation - Energy Information Administration
Feb 15, 2022Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth.  After removing the coal from the ground, the miners may send it to a preparation plant near the mining site. The plant cleans and processes coal to remove rocks, dirt, ash, sulfur, and other unwanted materials. This process increases the heating value of the coal.

## A Cost-Effective Solution for this Coal Preparation Plant | WSP
The Macquarie Coal Preparation Plant prepared coal from the West Wallsend Colliery in the Newcastle coal fields. Before coal washing stopped at the plant, the company needed to cap its tailings storage facility while it also continued to operate. The challenge was how to progressively cap a facility that was still receiving tailing deposits.
