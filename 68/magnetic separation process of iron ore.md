## Methods of Iron Ore Separation Process-FTM Machinery
Methods of Iron Ore Separation Process. At present, there are about 300 kinds of iron ore in nature. According to their chemical composition, iron ore can be divided into magnetite, hematite, limonite and siderite.  When the grinding size is greater than 0.2mm, most iron ore magnetic separation plants usually adopt a grinding - magnetic
