## Types of Iron Ore: Hematite vs. Magnetite
In Asia, a great deal of mining for hematite ore is done in China. Known reserves include the Tung-Yeh-Chen hematite ore deposit and the Dongye hematite ore deposit. One of the major advantages hematite ore has over other types like magnetite ore is its high iron content. That makes the iron extraction process much less costly and time consuming.

Iron mining deposit report for "Deposit #3718" (#3718) in Lincoln County, New Mexico.  The Magnetite Iron Mine is near Ancho, New Mexico.  The Magnetite Iron Mine was closed at the time of data entry with no known plans to re-open. Past operations took place from 1942 to 1943. Production size when active was considered to be small.

In recent years, magnetite trace elements have increasingly been applied in studies into ore deposits.
