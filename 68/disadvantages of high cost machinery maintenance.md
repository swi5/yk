## Track gauge
Uses of the term. The most common use of the term "track gauge" refers to the distance between the inside surfaces of the two load-bearing rails of a railway track.The term derives from the "gauge", a metal bar with a precisely positioned lug at each end that track crews use to ensure the actual distance between the rails lies within tolerances of a prescribed standard: on curves, for example

## Should You Repair, Rebuild, or Replace Equipment - MacAllister Machinery
For issues occurring after the warranty has expired, the 50/50 rule of equipment replacement can be a helpful heuristic. The 50 percent rule states that replacement is not necessary until the cost of repairing the machine exceeds more than half the cost of the desired replacement machine. For an accurate calculation, the costs of repairs should

## Corrective Maintenance/ Reactive Maintenance | Senseye
There's an important distinction in that corrective maintenance can be planned, whilst reactive maintenance is typically enacted after a failure has occurred or the machine is showing signs of damage. The machine is then inspected, repaired, restored, or replaced as part of a process to bring it back to correct operating and productive condition.

## What is RTF? | Run to Failure Maintenance Examples | Fiix
Run-to-failure maintenance makes sense when the total cost of repairing equipment after breakdown is less than the cost of performing other types of maintenance on the equipment beforehand. For example, let's say that you have a machine that's involved in a continuous, 24/7 production process.
