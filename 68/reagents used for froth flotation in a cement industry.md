## Froth Flotation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Froth Flotation. Froth flotation is a surface chemistry based separation process which is extensively used in the processing of mineral ore deposits as a method of separating the desired mineral component from their associated gangue material [17,34].

The froth flotation requires flotation reagents to work properly. Froth flotation chemicals or reagents are mostly found in liquid form. In the case of dry reagents, they should be fed dry. Collectors, activators, frothers, modifiers and depressants are the reagents used in froth flotation. A large amount of reagents is used in the process.
