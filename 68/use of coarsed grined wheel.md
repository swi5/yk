## What grinding wheel do I need to grind wedges and putters?
I'm looking to do some shaping and grinding of wedges and putters. What grinding wheel should I be using? I have a standard shop dual grinder so it would be best to get something to fit that (the grinding wheels on it now are way to rigid/coarse to properly grind a wedge or putter). I could also get another grinder if I needed to. [/quote]

## Which Grinding Wheel Should I Choose? | Norton
For this reason, finer grit sized wheels are required to grind hard materials and soft materials are best ground with medium to coarse grit size wheels. For most efficient operation, the grade must be adjusted to suit the hardness of the material. As a general guide, the harder the material, the softer the grade of wheel required.

A wheel dresser like the one shown here ($15 to $30) has a bar with diamond grit impregnated in it. Holding the bar against the spinning wheel cuts away the surface to expose new grit, squares the face of the wheel and rounds the wheel. To use a dressing tool like this, start the bench grinder and wait for it to reach full speed.

Saburr Tooth grinding wheels use the same carbide coating technology as the smaller Saburr Tooth tools. They are very long wearing, easy to control and will not load on most materials. They are ideal for use as an intermediate step between a fast wood removal tool, such as the Arbortech tools, and the beginning of the sanding process.

## What's the Right French Press Grind Size? (The Ultimate Guide)
Extra coarse grounds resemble peppercorns in size and shape. On most burr grinders, this is the farthest you can go when it comes to coarse grind levels. Because the extraction time is longer (up to 12 hours), such a grind is best for cold brews or French press iced coffee. Additionally, never forget that extraction time matters a lot.

## Surface Grinding Wheels: Types and Specification - Fine MetalWorking
Jan 17, 2021Above: Grinding wheels with different grain sizes. The grain size in your grinding wheel is classified as coarse 8-30, medium 30-60, fine 70-180 and very fine .The material removal rate will be more for your grinding wheel with coarse abrasives and less for a wheel with fine abrasives; also grinding wheels with fine or very fine abrasives gives a better finish compared to the grinding

## The back-end process: Step 3 - Wafer backgrinding
The coarse grinding typically removes approximately 90 percent of the excess material. A typical two-step backgrinding operation will use dual spindles with grinding wheels mounted on each spindle. Scratches and Wafer Strength. After backgrinding, the wafer will exhibit a scratch pattern on the backside (Figure 1a). The depth of these scratches

## Standard Backgrind | Backgrinding | Applications | Electronics
Coarse Grind. Based on the wafer type to be ground, we offer a variety of coarse wheels to suit specific needs. The standard coarse wheel that works on most of the applications is the Norton Winter #320 wheels. These can be offered in varying hardness for grinding different wafer types. A typical specification would be COARSE#3H1BXL9002. Fine Grind

## Pulse laser precision truing of the V-shaped coarse-grained 
1. Introduction. With the development of micro-structured surface elements, the machining demands of those elements on advance materials by highly precise contour grinding wheels are extremely urgent, .However, the serious grinding wheel wear is an important problem that limits the machining accuracy and efficiency, .In order to restrain the wear, the coarse-grained diamond,, and cubic
