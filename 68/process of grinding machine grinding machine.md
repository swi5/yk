## Grinding process
Grinding is the process of removing metal by the application of abrasives which are bonded to form a rotating wheel. When the moving abrasive particles contact the workpiece, they act as tiny cutting tools, each particle cutting a tiny chip from the workpiece.  The grinding machine supports and rotates the grinding abrasive wheel and often

Instead, centerless grinders are used for grinding very long pieces. The piece is hold by a dedicated support, while it will be subject to the simultaneous work of two wheels positioned on oblique axes to each other. Thanks to the different positioning of the two axes, the progress of the bar will be generated during processing.

Correctly balanced wheels result in superior surface finish and geometry - which is why all good grinders know the enemy of grinding is vibration. When a wheel is out of balance, the vibration is felt throughout the spindle assembly of the machine. In severe cases, wheel imbalance can be felt throughout the entire machine.
