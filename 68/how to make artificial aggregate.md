## Performance and durability of concrete made with demolition waste and 
Demolition aggregates and artificial aggregates made with waste materials are two alternatives being studied for replacement of natural aggregates in the production of concrete. Natural aggregate sources in Europe are increasingly scarce and subject to restrictions based on environmental regulations. In many areas of the developing world

Spread the blades of the artificial grass out and away from the nail. Gently hammer the nail or spike into the ground. Brush the blades upward to hide the nails. Place the nails every 6-8 inches around the perimeter of the artificial lawn. Then, hammer a nail in the inside area of fake grass every 2 feet or so.

## Artificial Grass Drainage Problems and Why They Happen
Bad drainage can make your artificial turf unstable. The appearance of little slopes or grades can be also the result of poor drainage. You can lose the turf's initial look, because excess liquid can deform it. Water can unlevel some parts of the artificial lawn. Mould, mildew and weed growth are encouraged, due to the high moisture levels.
