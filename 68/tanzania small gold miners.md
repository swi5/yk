## Mining accident
A mining accident is an accident that occurs during the process of mining minerals or metals. Thousands of miners die from mining accidents each year, especially from underground coal mining, although accidents also occur in hard rock mining.Coal mining is considered much more hazardous than hard rock mining due to flat-lying rock strata, generally incompetent rock, the presence of methane gas

However, this study focuses on the costs of that economic growth in gold production over small-scale miners. It is estimated that in the early 1990s, Small-Scale Mining in gold accommodated around 400,000 people in Tanzania. Due to a lack of hard data, this study was based on mostly qualitative fieldwork in Chunya district, Mbeya region, Tanzania.
