## Water tank failure at mine site is a warning for industry
Fortunately in this mining incident, no one was injured. The DMP said in May 2018, a 600,000 litre raw water tank failed. It was a rubber-lined steel construction. At the time of failure, the tank was near full capacity. The outrush of water affected an operational area of 24,000m², displacing pumping infrastructure, ladders and associated debris.
