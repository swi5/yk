Historically, bentonite has been used in the agglomeration process in North American iron ore plants. In 1986, Eveleth Mines replaced bentonite with Peridur, a carboxy methyl cellulose organic binder used in conjunction with 1% limestone. Since May of 1993, Allied Colloids` Alcotac FE8 has been used by Eveleth as the replacement for bentonite.

## Limestone and Dolomite and their Use in Iron and Steel Plant
The process of iron making is the reduction of iron ore to produce iron. Iron ore normally contain gangue materials such asSiO2, Al2O3 along with S and P. Removal of these impurities is done by combining the gangue materials with CaO and / or MgO to form slag which consists of low melting point complex compounds such as calcium silicate

The lowest temperature for complete reduction of Cr (Ⅲ) to Cr (N) was 1383 o C in theory, and the melting temperature of the reduction slag system needed to meet 1400 o C. Considering the energy and efficiency, 1400 o C was the optimal value.
