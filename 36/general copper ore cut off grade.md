## Cutoff grade
Cutoff grade. Cutoff grade is the minimum grade required in order for a mineral or metal to be economically mined (or processed). Material found to be above this grade is considered to be ore, while material below this grade is considered to be waste. [1] The cutoff grade can be determined through a variety of methods, each of varying complexity.

## A what is the percentage of ore to waste by weight - Course Hero
The cut-off grade of an ore is essentially the lowest grade of an ore that is worth mining. If the ore grade is less than the cut-off grade, then a mining company will not make money mining that ore. According to Fellows (2010), the cut-off grade of an ore is one of the main factors in determining the economics of the mine.
