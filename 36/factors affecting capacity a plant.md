## Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that, through cellular respiration, can later be released to fuel the organism's activities.Some of this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water - hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek

What are some examples of abiotic factors that affect carrying capacity? Abiotic factors may include space water and climate. The carrying capacity of an environment is reached when the number of births equal the number of deaths. A limiting factor determines the carrying capacity for a species.

## What Is A Limiting Factor That Keeps Populations From Growing?
Limiting factors include a low food supply and lack of space.Competition for resources like food and space cause the growth rate to stop increasing so the population levels off. The carrying capacity (K) is the maximum population size that can be supported in a particular area without destroying the habitat.

The factors affecting cation exchange capacity include the following (Brady and Weil 1999), soil texture, soil humus content, nature of clay and soil reaction. Soil texture influences the CEC of soils in a way that it increases when soil's percentage of clay increases i.e. the finer the soil texture, the higher the CEC as indicated in Table 2.

Factors Affecting Soil Compaction. As water is added to a soil ( at low moisture content) it becomes easier for the particles to move past one another during the application of the compacting forces. As the soil compacts the voids are reduced and this causes the dry unit weight ( or dry density) to increase.
