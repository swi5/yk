## USA - Process for removing impurities in the liquid of zinc 
Impurities in the liquid of zinc refining by wet method are removed by treating a solution containing zinc with metallic zinc and removing precipitate thereby formed, thereafter adding to the solution hydrogen peroxide in an amount sufficient to oxidize ferrous iron contained in the solution to ferric iron.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth?
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however, because iron does not occur naturally, it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.
