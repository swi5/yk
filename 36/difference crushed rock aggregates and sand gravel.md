Glacier stone is similar to crushed stone, it is screened to specific sizes and there should be no dirt or sand mixed in with it at all. The difference between these two stones is simply the way they look. The glacier stone (sometimes called river rock) is rounded and smooth, sometimes used for walkways or cosmetically around houses or gardens.
