Each year, millions of tons of by-product fines are produced during the crushing and processing of limestone and dolomite quarried in the United States. Similarly, a large amount of lime sludge is produced in the United States from water treatment plants that use lime softening to reduce the calcium and magnesium hardness of the source water.

## Lime use in gold processing - A review - ScienceDirect
Dec 1, 2021The silica and iron content of lime is typically low and inconsequential in gold processing, as it mainly remains inert. Most of the sulfur content originates from the calcination fuel used, rather than from the limestone. Sulfur containing fuels, therefore, increase the sulfur content of the lime.

Limestone is normally extracted from open-air quarries rather than underground mines, because of an outcrop of quality products (Fig 1) in most of the deposits.
