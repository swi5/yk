## From Lead Ore Saparated Gold And Silver Plant
In the past, high-grade sulphur lead ore would have been produced and smelted in nearby villages to produce metal lead and silver. Today, our mining operations produce Au, Ag, Zn ore and sell blended oxide Zn ore directly. Once produced, oxide Au and Ag ore is processed in Tepekoy plant to derive dore gold and silver ingots.

## 5 Methods of Gold-Silver Ore Extraction | Mining Pedia
When formulating a cyanidation system for silver-containing ore, the following measures should be taken: 1) Leach with concentrated cyanide solution (0.2~0.6% NaCN); 2) Long time (up to 2 to 3 days) leaching; 3) Inflate strongly into the pulp; 4) Add lead salt to the pulp; 5) Bromine cyanidation and so on.
