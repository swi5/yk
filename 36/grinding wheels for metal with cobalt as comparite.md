## CBN Grinding Wheel - Diamond Grinding tools
Cubic boron nitride grinding wheel is a kind of circular bonded abrasives with a central through-hole. It is made of cubic boron nitride (CBN) powder, metal, resin, vitrified and electroplated bond. It consists of cubic boron nitride (CBN), transition layer and matrix. CBN is a superhard material whose hardness is second only to diamond.

## Why Diamond Grinding Wheels Are Super-Abrasives
These grinding wheels are normally used for pre-forming either stone or glass roughly and have a longer grinding life. Carbide has various grades and some can affect the diamond grinding wheel especially if there is more cobalt content in the carbide. The softer the carbide grade the more wear and tear it will cause to the grinding wheel.

## Guide to Grinding Wheels | Weiler Abrasives
The bond is the substance that causes the abrasive grains to adhere to the wheel. Bonds can consist of different materials. Common materials include shellac, resinoids, rubber and glass or glass-ceramic. At Weiler Abrasives, our portable grinding wheels contain resinoid bonds. The bond on a grinding wheel may be either hard or soft.
