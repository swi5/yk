## Anthracite Coal Mining Market Global Industry Analysis, Forecast 2019
Anthracite is a hard and compact variety of coal that has the highest content of carbon amongst all types of coals. With fewer impurities & highest calorific value there is a global increase in anthracite's demand which is escalating the anthracite coal mining market. It accounts for only 1% of the total world's coal reserves.

## About Us | No. 9 Coal Mine
The No. 9 Coal Mine was first opened in 1855 by the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company. A large vein of Anthracite coal, known as the Mammoth Vein, was the main focus of mining operations in the Panther Valley. Early mining operations in the area were located in the town of Summit Hill, just above Lansford.

Anthracite coal, because it burned cleaner than soft coal, had become the main heating fuel in many Eastern cities. Rivalry for control of the industry led to over expansion, violent business fluctuations, and eventually control by a few large independent mine owners, coal railroads, and bankers.

## Anthracite Coal-Mine Fires of Northeastern Pennsylvania
Anthracite coal is a product of metamorphism and is associated with metamorphic rocks. Anthracite is a higher rank of coal than bituminous coal because most of the volatile material has been driven off, so that it contains between 92% and 98% carbon. Anthracite coal is difficult to ignite but burns hotter and cleaner.

Partial List of Name Anthracite Coal Breakers and Collieries . As anthracite mining got underway it was realized that coal did not come out of a mine in uniformly sized and clean pieces. As it was blasted loose from veins deep underground, the coal fell in all sizes mixed with rock, slate, dirt and a myriad of other impurities.

Lewis Hine, sociologist and photographer, took many photos of "Breaker Boys." A breaker boy was child laborer at the coal-mine whose job it was to separate impurities such as rock, slate, wood, sulfur, ash, clay, and soil from the coal using his bare hands in the coal breaker. He did this work while seated over wooden seats and conveyer belts.

Anthracite, also known as hard coal, and black coal, is a hard, compact variety of coal that has a submetallic luster.It has the highest carbon content, the fewest impurities, and the highest energy density of all types of coal and is the highest ranking of coals.. Anthracite is the most metamorphosed type of coal (but still represents low-grade metamorphism), in which the carbon content is

The heat content of anthracite coal consumed in the United States averages 25 million Btu/ton (29 MJ/kg), on the as-received basis (i.e., containing both inherent moisture and mineral matter). Since the 1980s, anthracite refuse or mine waste has been used for coal power generation in a form of recycling.

## Anthracite Heritage: Landscape, Memory and the Environment
The anthracite region is littered with relics of the coal mining industry. Strip mines, coal dumps, and culm banks are separated by shrinking towns. Goin and Raymond (2004, 39) note that the culm banks scattered throughout the landscape are viewed by the miners and descendants of the miners as monuments to the hard work performed by numerous
