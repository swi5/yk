## A Comprehensive Guide to Asphalt Patching - Asphalt Kingdom
Hot asphalt is a long lasting durable product, made from rock, sand, tar and bitumen. It is extremely hot when it is first applied so that it can be worked into the repair area. As the hot asphalt cools, it hardens and becomes solid. It takes approximately 24 hours for a hot asphalt patch to harden and be safe to drive on.

As noted on the bag, QPR is specifically designed to remain somewhat pliable after application. This allows the product to continue to fill small voids and crevices, through continued compaction. Totally filling these voids prevents water (and in the winter - ice) from getting into the repaired area, and ultimately causing your patch to fail.

## What exactly does diesel do when spilled on asphalt?
Science. Asphalt cement, the binder in asphalt surfaces, is a heavy petroleum product. The material can be easily dissolved and diluted when exposed to lighter grades of petroleum oil. When that puddle sat on the asphalt material, the diesel fuel was absorbed by the petroleum, lowering its freeze point and making it soft. The damage is permanent.

## How to Use | U.S. Cold Patch
For repairs deeper than two inches, apply and tamp U.S. Cold Patch in 1 to 2 inch layers. Add enough material so that tamping leaves a slight crown. If over time a patch settles below the road surface, clean the surface of the patch and add U.S. Cold Patch, and compact.
