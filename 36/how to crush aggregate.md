The total moisture measured in the test represents both the free moisture and the moisture that the aggregate absorbs. Only the free moisture becomes part of the mix water. The absorbed water, usually about 1 percent, remains within the aggregate. If the coarse aggregate is unusually porous, the absorption should be determined by a separate test.

Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. After harvesting, aggregate is processed: crushed, screened, and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.
