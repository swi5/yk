## crushing rate for gyratory crusher vs blast fragmentation
The primary gyratory crusher offers high capacity thanks to its generously dimensioned circular discharge opening (which provides a much larger area than that of the jaw crusher) and the continuous operation principle (while the reciprocating motion of the jaw crusher produces a batch crushing action). The gyratory crusher has capacities

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency - Pit & Quarry
Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of a machine's work to the energy supplied to the machine. To apply what this means to your crusher, operations produce the exact sizes in the reduction process that their market demands. In the past, quarries produced a range of single-size aggregate products - up to 40 mm in size.

Comparison of performance advantages of gyratory crusher and jaw crusher. The outstanding advantage of the gyratory crusher is that the crushing wall is large, which can reach -9.5, and sometimes it can be as high as 13.5. The production efficiency is high, and the work is relatively stable. Either side can feed ore and can be crowded with ore.
