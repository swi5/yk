The Montorfano and Baveno granite ore bodies are located in the Lake District (VCO-NE Piedmont). They were and are still quarried as dimension stones, with a consequent production of a huge volume of "waste." In 1995, an Italian company (GMM S.p.A) decided to invest in the valorisation of granite quarry waste as a secondary raw material. An in situ geological prospecting was

## Coal waste - Global Energy Monitor
Coal mining and coal combustion in power plants produce several types of wastes: The mining process itself produces waste coal or solid mining refuse, which is a mixture of coal and rock.; The mining process also produces liquid coal waste, which is then stored in impoundments.; Pollution control equipment used for coal combustion produces coal ash or fly ash, as well as flue-gas
