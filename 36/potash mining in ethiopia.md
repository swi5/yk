## Opportunities and hurdles in Ethiopia's mining sector
The practice of mining in Ethiopia is as old as the written history of the country dating back to antiquities. However, even today, despite the potentials of the mineral resources the country possesses, the sector has failed to play a significant role in the country's economic development.  Allana Potash, a Canadian mining company is

## Mining the green gold of Ethiopia's Danakil - The Africa Report
The mining sector currently accounts for around 1% of the Ethiopian economy, but the government expects that in 10 years' time it will represent 10% of GDP. Potash is likely to be one of the first commodities to contribute to this growth. In the remote and arid Danakil Depression, in northeast Ethiopia, lies the world's largest potash deposit.

## Mining Potash for Fertilizer - Advancing Mining
A Potash Mine. Potash, pronounced pot-ash, is the term commonly used to describe potassium-containing salts used as fertilizer. Most potash is derived from potassium chloride (KCl), which is also known as Muriate of Potash (MOP). As a source of soluble potassium, potash is vital to the agricultural industry as a primary plant nutrient.
