Tool joints are much thicker than the drill pipe, too thick to be cut by conventional blowout preventers. So, according to Read, about ten percent of the time the blowout preventer is unable to shear.

Sep 5, 2022The equipment that seals the well is the blowout preventer (BOP). It consists of drillpipe blowout preventers designed to stop the flow through the drillpipe and annular preventers designed to stop flow in the annulus. The drilling rig must be evaluated to determine if its BOP equipment meets the minimum specifications.

A blowout preventer is a large, heavy valve or stack of valves fitted at the top of an oil well. Blowout preventers are used to seal, control and monitor oil and gas wells to prevent the release of oil or gas from wells and rigs. There are two main types of blowout preventers: Annular and RAM.

## Before You Buy a Blowout Preventer | BOP Products
A ram blowout preventer functions like a gate valve at the top of a BOP stack on an oil well, regulating the flow of oil and sealing off the well when necessary. The seal is achieved through a pair of steel plungers that pull inward to restrict flow and press outward to allow the oil to flow freely. How Quickly You Need the Equipment

## CNA - Special rotary blowout preventer for 27/8' drilling 
The invention relates to a special rotary blowout preventer for 27/8' drilling tools, which mainly solves the problems of waste and poor centralizing and sealing capabilities which are caused by the fact that existing rotary blowout preventers are not applicable to 27/8' drilling tools. The special rotary blowout preventer is characterized in that a bolt at the bottom of a central tube (2) is

## How To Prevent A Blowout | Pressure Control | Dosco
Sep 16, 2020Preventing a Blowout. The downhole fluid pressures are controlled in modern wells through the balancing of the hydrostatic pressure provided by the column. Should the balance of the drilling mud pressure be incorrect (i.e., the mud pressure gradient is less than the formation pore pressure gradient), then formation fluids (oil, natural gas and

## Blowout Preventer - Types - Annular Blowout Preventer
An annular-type blowout preventer can close around the drill string, casing or a non-cylindrical object, such as the kelly. Drill pipe including the larger-diameter tool joints (threaded connectors) can be "stripped" (i.e., moved vertically while pressure is contained below) through an annular preventer by careful control of the hydraulic
