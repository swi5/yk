Owing to its high power motor, the average crusher can easily crush hard objects like rocks and boulders into smaller pieces, which makes them significantly easier to transport. Crushers are commonly divided into three main types, namely; Pressure Crushers, Impact Crushers, and Fairmount Type Crushers In A Nutshell:

The jaw crusher is usually made of cast steel because it is such a heavy-duty machine. Its outer frame is generally made of cast iron or steel. While the jaws themselves are usually constructed from cast steel. They are fitted with replaceable liners which are made of manganese steel, or Ni-hard (a Ni-Cr alloyed cast iron).
