## Processing high purity quartz sand with quartz gravel-Sinonine
The silica sand processing plant adopts the following technical scheme: Step 1: Take quartz gravel and crush it into pieces. Step 2: Put quartz gravel fragments into the autogenous mill, and add water to the autogenous grinding machine according to the mass ratio of quartz gravel to water of 1:035-0.5 for autogrinding.
