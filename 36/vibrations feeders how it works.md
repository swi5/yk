## How Does the Vibrating Grizzly Feeder Work?
Jun 9, 2022The vibrating grizzly feeder consists of a disc section at the feed end to receive and begin separating material. The discharge end consists of a lattice section with openings to allow undersized material to pass through before being discharged into the crusher. The feeder is mounted on a spring and vibrates by a mechanism located below the

## Vibrating feeder
A vibratory feeder is an instrument that uses vibration to "feed" material to a process or machine. Vibratory feeders use both vibration and gravity to move material. Gravity is used to determine the direction, either down, or down and to a side, and then vibration is used to move the material. They are mainly used to transport a large number
