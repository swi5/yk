## Maximizing Iron Unit Yield from Ore to Liquid Steel (Part 3  - Midrex
The melting yield of DRI can vary depending on the iron ore chemistry, metallic iron content, carbon content, and melting practice. As we discussed in Part 1 of this series, the objective when selecting iron ores for direct reduction is to use those having high iron content, low gangue content (especially SiO2 and Al2O3), and good reducibility

## Iron Ore Processing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In India, where iron ore processing is one of the major industries, the generation of tailings is estimated to be 10-25 % of the total iron ore mined, amounting to 18 million tons per year (Das et al., 2000 ). The tailings contain silica in high percentage (40-60 %, from various locations). This makes it a suitable raw material for the
