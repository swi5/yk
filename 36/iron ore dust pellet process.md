## iron ore dust pellet process - Industar
Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes. Pelletizing is a process which involves mixing of very finely ground particles of iron ore fines having asizewhich isless than 200 mesh (0.074 mm)withadditives like bentonite andthenshaping them into near oval/spherical balls having size intherange of 8 mm to 16 mm in diameter byapelletizerand hardening the balls by firing with a fuel.

## iron ore dust pellet process
Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview. Pellets are obtained byadding an appropriate amount of water to the iron ore concentrate; this is a fundamental factor in the formation and growth of pellets, which creates a surface tension that holds the mineral grains cohesive, thus allowing their handling [6, 8] This cohesive tension of fine particles due to water is called neutral tension Iron

The pelletizing process is a process which contains numerous sub-processes, or process segments. On the way from the mine to a final product, the iron ore goes through the following main process segments: 1) The iron ore is crushed and the waste rock is removed. About 85 % of the particles should be less than 44 μm (in length, width, or height).

An example of this is in the pelletizing of electric-arc furnace (EAF) dust. EAF dust is a byproduct of steel production and is rich in metals — particularly iron, lead and zinc. To recover these metals, EAF dust is roasted in a kiln. Roasting is made especially complicated when the material to be processed is in the form of a dust.

## New Process of Pellets-Metallized Sintering Process  - SpringerLink
An innovative process of pellets-metallized sintering process (PMSP) to prepare pre-reduced ironmaking burden using zinc-bearing dust has been developed. The pre-reduced sinter product, assaying 60.53 pct Fe with the metallization degree of 45.23 pct, and the Zn and Pb content of 0.18 and 0.02 pct with the removal rate of 92.78 and 96.37 pct were obtained at the productivity of 0.471 t m−2 h

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
