## How To Use Control Charts To Improve Manufacturing Quality - dataPARC
The main purpose of control charts is to help determine if a process is stable and in-control, or unstable and out-of-control. When a process is stable, or "in control," this means that it is predictable and affected only by normal random causes of variation. An unstable or "out-of-control" process is affected by the same common causes

## Production & Manufacturing Process Flow Charts & Workflow Templates 
The production process, or manufacturing process, consists of a few key components or sub-processes from production planning through quality assurance and inspection of final products. Manufacturing process flow charts, or workflows, can be applied to the manufacturing process to reduce lead times, increase machine utilization and optimize first pass yields.
