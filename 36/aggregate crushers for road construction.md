Aggregate crushing value = (W1/W2)100. A value less than 10 signifies an exceptionally strong aggregate while above 35 would normally be regarded as weak aggregates.  The specific gravity of aggregates normally used in road construction ranges from about 2.5 to 2.9. Water absorption values ranges from 0.1 to about 2.0 percent for aggregates

## Crushing it! - Construction World
While commercial aggregate producers still prefer stationary plants or skid-mounted crushers, in the mining sector, mobile units are preferred as the crusher needs to be moved frequently. In turn, mobile crushers have limited application in road construction where contractors have been awarded long stretches.

Natural Aggregate. Using natural rocks (such as limestone, granite, basalt, etc.) mined as raw materials, aggregates made by physical crushing are called natural aggregates, such as sand, crushed stone, gravel, etc. It is an important part of concrete and is widely used in urban road engineering, bridges, buildings and other infrastructure fields.

## An Investigation Into Quality of Aggregate in Road Construction
These two aggregate samples were tested for sieve analysis test, relative density test, water absorption test, ten percent fine test, aggregate crushing value test (ACV), Aggregate impact value test (AIV), and Abrasion value test. Findings revealed that the best aggregate for road construction is the aggregate from Isi-Agu.
