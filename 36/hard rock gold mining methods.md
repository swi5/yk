## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## Mining Methods - Calaveras Heritage Council
The Gold Rush period was dominated by placer mining for gold. It was not until hard rock or deep mining spread that other metals, along with gold, were mined.  The placer mining methods used in California had been known for centuries. They were employed by the Spanish in the New World, and by miners in Georgia and North Carolina in the 1820s

Gold Ore Mining Techniques. For the average small-scale prospector, there are just a few methods that work well to locate gold in rock. First, I always recommend that you carry a gold pan and sample the gravels in the area. Even in a desert, you can dig down into a dry wash and pack in some water to use while panning.

Four main methods of mining are available: underground, open surface (pit), placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and often used to reach deposits that are deeper. Surface mines are usually used for deposits that are shallower and less valuable. Placer mining is used in river channels, beach sands, or other

The purpose of a gold mill, at least a simple one, is to crush and grind rock fine enough to release small particles of gold. After liberating the gold from the rock or gangue, it is then run through a gravity separation step, which will concentrate most of the gold and wash off the lighter waste rock. Step 1.

## How is gold mined? - Gold-Traders (UK) Ltd
In placer mining, the gold is retrieved by metal detecting, panning, cradling, sluicing and dredging. Using gravity and water to separate the dense gold from the other materials that surround it, this is the most common gold mining category for amateur gold hunters. Hard rock mining is the process of using open pit or underground mining tunnels

Placer mining targets "native" gold that isn't chemically bound up within the rock itself. The sources of all placer gold are "lodes", or veins of gold naturally formed within the rock. Ongoing weathering and erosion of rock outcrops continuously exposes new fragments of gold that wash downstream. Because gold is far denser than most rock (19.3
