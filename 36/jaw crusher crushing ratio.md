## Tips for maintaining efficiency in crushing circuits - Quarry
In practice, many jaw crushers are not fed to their design capacity; this is because the subsequent processing plant does not have sufficient capacity to handle the volume of material that would be produced if the jaw crusher were working to capacity. Crushing setting: Efficiency. Ideally, the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6:1.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
