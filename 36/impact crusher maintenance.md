## Jaw and Impact Crusher Maintenance - RR Equipment
Dec 20, 2021I would say that in general, yeah, there's definitely some maintenance involved with crushing. Typically we're looking at the wear parts or the actual parts of the crusher that are impacted by the material. So if it's an impact crusher it would be the blow bars. If it's a jaw crusher it's the jaw dies or jaw plates.

## Optimizing Your Impact Crusher - Eagle Crusher
Another way to optimize an impact crusher is simply by investing in its regular maintenance to ensure the pieces and parts remain in good working condition. For instance, as blow bars wear, the gap between the aprons and blow bars grow, and aprons should be repositioned to account for this discrepancy. In addition to avoiding widened gaps

## Should I Choose an Impact Rock Crusher or Cone Crusher? - Sepro Aggregates
Impact crushers include vertical shaft impactors or horizontal shaft impactors. Compression crushers require much less maintenance; high impact crushers undergo more wear and tear due to the material colliding within the crusher. In contrast, compression crushers typically have lower maintenance costs overall due to less wear and tear.
