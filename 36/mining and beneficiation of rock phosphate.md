Dec 28, 2021This is a chemical beneficiation method, which is mainly used for carbonate-type phosphate rock with few silicate minerals. Carbonate minerals are used to liberate CO₂ under high temperature thermal decomposition, and then water is added to hydrate CaO and MgO into fine particles of Ca(OH)₂ and Mg(OH)₂.
