mill is rigid enough at all to make use of tapered roller bearings. Some round column mill drills do use tapered rollers, but in that. case it is a cost cutting measure, as fitting and set up is not as. exacting as using preloaded ball bearings in a spindle. If you spin tapered rollers fast, they get hot.

## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
If a ball mill uses little or no water during grinding, it is a 'dry' mill. If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills.

Depending on the type of machinery, the application conditions of the bearings will be different, and their functional requirements are also different, but generally speaking, there are not less than two bearings used on one shaft.. In addition, in order to facilitate axial positioning, most of the bearings are used as fixed-end bearings while others are used as free-end bearings.
