## Top Largest Deposits of Metals Around the World - Industrial Metal Supply
The reddish-brown metal is often found in large mineral deposits of sedimentary rocks. Metal deposits contain significant amounts of metallic elements, such as gold, copper, and iron. Deposits which can be economically extracted for human use are classified as ores. To be commercially viable, iron ores must contain about 60 percent iron.
