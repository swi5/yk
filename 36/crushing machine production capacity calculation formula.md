## What Is Production Capacity and How to Calculate It?
Jul 23, 2021You can find your capacity utilization rate by dividing your actual level of output by your production capacity and multiplying the result by 100. The capacity utilization rate is great for assessing your operational efficiency as well as your costs and pricing. Generally, an 85% rate is considered optimal.

## Capacity Utilization Rate (Definition, Formula) | How to Calculate?
The potential production is 60,000 stickers. By using the formula of capacity utilization, we get: -. Capacity Utilization = Actual Output / Potential Output  100. Capacity Utilization = 40,000 / 60,000  100 = 66.67%. From the above, we can also find the slack of Funny Stickers Co. during the last month of 2017. = (100% - 66.67%) = 33.33%
