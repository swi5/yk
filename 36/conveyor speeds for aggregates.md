## Useful Knowledge: Methods of Measuring Conveyor Belt Speed
As the drum rotates, objects and materials placed on top of the conveyor belt will move from side to side. The speed at which the conveyor belt moves depends on the size of the drum and its revolutions per minute. Measure the diameter of the rollers that wrap the conveyor belt. Multiply the diameter of the roller by pi, 3.14159.

Using the portland cement example above, it is described as free-flowing and moderately abrasive. CEMA recommends a minimum load of no more than 30 percent. CEMA also recommends reducing the screw conveyor speed when conveying soft to extremely abrasive materials. Reducing the channel load and speed will reduce wear on the screw conveyor.

## What Makes a Smart Conveyor System "Smart"? - control
The tools allow smart conveyors to synchronize the material movement with other machines, such as packaging machines. Artificial Intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a major contributor in developing smart conveyors. It enables the smart conveyors to make decisions independently, such as when to move materials using a fast or slow speed.

## Conveyor Speed Calculator & FPM Formula Guide | Cisco-Eagle
The standard speed for most unit handling conveyors is 65 FPM (feet per minute) which works out to the average speed a person walks when carrying a 50-pound box. This pace is ideal for many—but not all—order picking and assembly operations. There are always situations where transport through an area, into a process, or toward a packing operation can be accelerated.
