## Carbon capture and storage
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) or carbon capture and sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide (CO 2) before it enters the atmosphere, transporting it, and storing it (carbon sequestration) for centuries or millennia.Usually the CO 2 is captured from large point sources, such as a chemical plant or biomass power plant, and then stored in an underground geological formation.

Coal is a non-clastic sedimentary rock. They are the fossilized remains of plants and are in flammable black and brownish-black tones. Its main element is carbon, but it can also contain different elements such as hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen. Unlike coal minerals, it does not have a fixed chemical composition and crystal structure.
