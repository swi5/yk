## Archaeometallurgical slag
The ores used in ancient smelting processes were rarely pure metal compounds. Impurities were removed from the ore through the process of slagging, which involves adding heat and chemicals. Slag is the material in which the impurities from ores (known as gangue), as well as furnace lining and charcoal ash, collect. The study of slag can reveal information about the smelting process used at the

Conclusion. While aluminum doesn't get rusty, corrosion can be just as bad. Not only does it permanently remove the oxide layer on the surface (making it susceptible to further corrosion), but it also makes the material powdery, flakey, and weak. Aluminum can't rust unless it's aluminum alloy (including other metals).
