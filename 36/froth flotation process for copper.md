## Extraction Of Copper | Mining, Concentration, Smelting - Byju's
The percentage of copper in the actual ore is too low for direct extraction of copper to be viable. The concentration of ore is required and it is done by the Froth Flotation method. Concentration of Ore: The ore is crushed into a fine powder and a suspension is created in water. To this are added, Collectors and Froth Stabilizers.

May 24, 2022The froth flotation process is mainly used to separate non-ferrous metals such as copper, lead, zinc, nickel, gold, etc. In addition, froth flotation is suitable for the separation of fine particles that are difficult to recover by other beneficiation methods. Copper-lead ore has the characteristics of fine particle size and dense symbiosis of
