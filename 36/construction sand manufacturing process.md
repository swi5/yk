The Manufacturing Process. Rocks or quarry stones are blasted and subjected to a series of crushing cycles to reduce the particles to the size of naturally occurring sand. The produced sand is then sieved and washed to remove fine particles and impurities, and tested for various quality aspects before it is deemed fit as a construction aggregate.

## Sand
Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. Sand has various compositions but is defined by its grain size. Sand grains are smaller than gravel and coarser than silt.Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e., a soil containing more than 85 percent sand-sized particles by mass.. The composition of sand varies, depending on the

## Cement Manufacturing Process | Phases | Flow Chart | Cement
Cement Manufacturing Process Phase 1: Raw Material Extraction. Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. Such raw materials are limestone, clay and sand. Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand & clay fulfill the need of silicon, iron and aluminum.

## Shell molding
Shell molding, also known as shell-mold casting, is an expendable mold casting process that uses resin covered sand to form the mold.As compared to sand casting, this process has better dimensional accuracy, a higher productivity rate, and lower labour requirements.It is used for small to medium parts that require high precision. Shell molding was developed as a manufacturing process during
