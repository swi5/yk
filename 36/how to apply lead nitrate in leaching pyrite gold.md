Lead_Nitrate authorSTREAM. The benefit of lead as a leach enhancer in gold cyanidation has been recognised since the early 80s but it has only been since the mid-90s that the use of lead nitrate as a lead source has become widespread in gold cyanidation to improve leaching kinetics and increase the quantity of gold,

## lead nitrate in mineral processing
The addition of lead nitrate results in a higher gold extraction, although cyanide consumption cannot be reduced below 1.85 kg/t without a drop in the extraction. Without lead nitrate, the gold recovery is lower than 90% but with lead nitrate, it reaches 98%. The addition of oxygen increases the gold recovery by 1.5%.
