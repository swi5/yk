## Stone Dust Doesn't Belong Under Pavers. Here's Why.
In contrast to stone dust, concrete sand provides superior performance over time. It doesn't eat away at pavers, it affords excellent drainage, and it compacts well. The coarse texture also acts to hold pavers in position, providing a stabilizing buffer that allows the ground underneath to shift without shifting pavers.

## Stone dust vs sand for laying pavers? Help! - Houzz
The sand - "concrete sand" is where the interlock takes place - it comes up and fills the joints causing them to lock up. Stone dust will only get hard "under" the pavers and actually hold water, which is another issue. Use concrete sand and only 3/4" under the pavers.

Crushed stone is made from rocks that have been broken down by machines called crushers, giving the stones more angular surfaces. This material is produced rather than formed naturally and comes in a variety of sizes ranging from stone dust or screenings to about 12" or larger in diameter.

## 3 Reasons Why It's Important To Use Crushed Stone Under Concrete Slabs
Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab. Adding a layer of crushed stone will add proper drainage, as well as create a barrier between your slab and the ground.

Civil Engineering from Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) 5 y Yes As quarry dust (also called as crushed sand) is a byproduct obtained after crushing of stones (rocks) to make aggregates. Results have shown that the concrete made using crushed sand attains the compressive strength earlier as compared to the concrete made of natural sand.
