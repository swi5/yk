## Magnetite | Geology Wiki | Fandom
Magnetite is a rock mineral and one of the main iron ores, with the chemical formula Fe3O4. It is one of the oxides of iron, and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. It is the most magnetic of all the naturally-occurring minerals on Earth. Naturally-magnetized pieces of magnetite, called lodestone, will attract small pieces of

## Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation - IspatGuru
Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

## Iron Ore | METS Engineering
Iron Ore. Australia is the largest producer of iron ore in the world, producing approximately 37% of the world's production (USGS 2018). Iron ore is categorised depending on where it is produced and priced, by its iron content and level of impurities. The main minerals associated with iron ore processing are hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ), magnetite
