## Gravel not filling lava lake? : Minecraft - reddit
Hey, So I'm trying to clear out a big lava lake in the nether. I've been placing gravel and letting it fall to the bottom, until the gravel reaches the surface. The problem is, there are some squares where this doesn't seem to work. I'm at Y 32, and after placing 40+ gravel at one spot, it still doesn't reach the surface.
