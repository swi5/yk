## Limestone Industry - University of Kentucky
In central Kentucky, Ordovician limestone and dolomite are mined and quarried for construction aggregate. Stone is being produced from the High Bridge Group and the overlying Lexington Limestone. The High Bridge Group consists of three formations: in descending stratigraphic order, the Tyrone Limestone, Oregon Formation, and Camp Nelson Limestone.

Oct 13, 2020Limestone mining and utilization in Missouri began in the mid 1800s. The amount mined prior to 1920 is not known for certain. Since that time, however, reliable statistics do indicate that 3.1 billion short tons of limestone having a present value of about $17.5 billion have been mined in Missouri from 1920 to present.

Limestone vs Dolomite . Both limestone and dolomite are types of rock made of carbonate residues. The patterns of the way they behave chemically are almost the same with varied intensities. However, the structure and the formation of these rocks are quite different. Limestone. Limestone mainly consists of two types of minerals; namely, calcite
