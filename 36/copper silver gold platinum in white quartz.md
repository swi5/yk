## Copper, Silver, Gold. Platinum - Page 2 - MMO-Champion
Platinum if much more rare than Gold and more expensive. Do a search for the price per ounce of both. Gold is significantly higher. (Today's price: Gold - $1315.94 USD, Platinum - $876.44 USD) It may be more rare. But its definitely not more expensive. Last edited by Gurbz; at 01:04 AM .

## Gold Alloy - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Modern white golds are based on alloys in the gold-nickel-copper system to which 5-12 wt.% zinc is added. A two-phase immiscibility gap is also present in this system as in the gold-silver-copper system; however, it is symmetrical around the copper content not the gold content, unlike the gold-silver-copper system. White golds

## Platinum, Silver, and White Gold: Which is Best? - TrueFacet
CON: Platinum is much more expensive than silver and white gold. Also, because platinum is a heavy precious metal and sold by weight, it inflates the overall cost. PRO: As an alloy metal, white gold comes in varying degrees of purity; the higher the percentage of pure gold, the more expensive your ring will be.

The more pure gold used in an alloy, the yellower it appears. 18 karat white gold, which is 75% yellow gold, appears less white than 14 karat white gold, which is only 58.3% yellow gold. Platinum alloys appear whiter than white gold alloys, because they contain only white metals.
