Numerically, the work index is the energy required in kwh/t to reduce a given material from theoretically infinite feed size to 80% passing 100 microns. The work index of a particular material is determined in the laboratory by conducting the standard Bond grindability test. Bond developed separate tests for the rod mill and the ball mill

## Typewriter
A typewriter is a mechanical or electromechanical machine for typing characters. Typically, a typewriter has an array of keys, and each one causes a different single character to be produced on paper by striking an inked ribbon selectively against the paper with a type element.At the end of the nineteenth century, the term 'typewriter' was also applied to a person who used such a device.

The Bond work index is a measure of ore resistance to crushing and grinding and is determined using the Bond grindability test. Its value constitutes ore characteristic and is used for industrial comminution plants designing. Determining the Bond work index value is quite complicated, timeconsuming and requires trained operating personnel and therefore is subjected to errors.

## bond work index for different materials
The Bond Work Index is material specific and is obtained from laboratory crushing tests on the feed material. Hard and brittle materials have a work index in the range 4 × 10 4 − 8 × 10 4 J/kg. Bond's law holds reasonably well for a variety of materials undergoing coarse, medium and fine size reduction. (Eq. 14.3a) can also be reduced to

## Bond Work Index Formula-Equation - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
In a recent publication fifteen different ores each had grindability tests made at 28, 35, 48, 65 and 100 mesh, with many work index variations at the different product sizes. These tests are used here to develop empirical equations from which the work index at different product sizes can be computed from a grindability test at one size.
