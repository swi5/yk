Farmers can use the resulting byproduct as a liming agent. The acid neutralizing value of the water treatment lime can be similar to, or even greater than ground ag lime. The material is also very fine, and dissolves and reacts quickly in the soil solution. By the nature of its production, water treatment lime is very wet - 40-50% moisture.
