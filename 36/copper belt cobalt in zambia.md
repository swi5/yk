## Production of cobalt from copper-cobalt ores on the African Copperbelt 
Differences exist between in the Zambian and DRC parts of the Copperbelt. The ratio of copper-to-cobalt is between 6 and 20 to 1, with the ores from the DRC richer in cobalt than those from Zambia. The minerals from which cobalt is extracted in Zambia tend to be more sulphide in nature, while those extracted in the DRC are more oxide in nature.
