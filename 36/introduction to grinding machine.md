## Introduction Of Grinder Machine
Introduction • A grinding machine often shortened to grinder is any of various power tools or machine tools used for grinding which is a type of machining using an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool. Each grain of abrasive on the wheels surface cuts a small chip from the work piece via shear deformation.

## Introduction to Metallographic Grinding and Polishing
Metallographic grinding and polishing processes differ depending on the sample material. These differences usually affect the consumables required or the number of necessary grinding and polishing steps. For example, steel with a hardness between 35 and 65 HRC (medium-hard to hard steels) is relatively easy to prepare.
