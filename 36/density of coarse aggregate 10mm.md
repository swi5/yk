When you use a smaller aggregate, such as the 10mm as your nominal coarse aggregate size, the specific surface area of the total volume of coarse aggregate is much higher than for the 20mm aggregate.  that is always our worry - the heat of hydration and density of concrete - not so much regarding strength except on spillways .

Coarse Aggregate is normally greater than 5mm. Fine Aggregate is aggregate less than 5mm. Can be a single sized material typically 20mm, 14mm, 10mm,or 7mm or a graded aggregate consisting of a blend of single sized aggregate. Concrete Aggregates are produced to Australian Standards (AS 2758) or to more specific customer requirements.

## How to Choose Quality Coarse Aggregate for Concrete Construction?
To ensure good coarse aggregate compaction and higher concrete density, it is recommended to mix 20 mm and 10 mm coarse aggregates in the ratio of 70:30 or 60:40. It is recommended to stack different aggregate sizes to use them efficiently. Prevent the use of friable and chert aggregates. The former is susceptible to splitting, whereas the

## Aggregate density tablerotkabine-rewa
Answer (1 of 3): thanks for ask bro Coarse Aggregate in general should consist of natural occurring stones (crushed, uncrushed or broken), riverbed single or pit gravel . It should be hard, strong, dense, durable, and clean. It must be free from veins, adherent coatings and.
