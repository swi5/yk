## Simulation of railway ballast using crushable polyhedral particles
Ballast grains are represented by randomly-shaped polyhedral particles generated via Voronoi tessellation. Novel algorithm to compute contact force based on the intersecting volume is presented. Crushing is included via splitting the particles. Model results are compared with the published experimental investigation.
