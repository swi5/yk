Iodine, as rock salt, seems to have really important effects on health. Its effects on the thyroid gland are well known. Such is just one of the many reasons to iodize rock salt. The objective of iodization is to strengthen rock salt by adding some other necessary minerals. There are many ills caused by a lack of iodine in consumed rock salt.
