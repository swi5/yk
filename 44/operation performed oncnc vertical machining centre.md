## Milling (machining)
Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece.This may be done by varying direction on one or several axes, cutter head speed, and pressure. Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations.

## CNC Turning - Process, Operations & Machinery | Fractory
Turning is a subtractive machining process that uses a cutting tool to remove material for creating cylindrical parts. The tool itself moves along the axis of the machined part while the part is rotating, creating a helical toolpath. The term turning refers to producing parts by cutting operations on the external surface.

## Unit 3: Vertical Milling Center Machine Motion - Manufacturing 
VMC Machine Motion. CNC machines use a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Figure 10. shows a typical Vertical Milling Center (VMC). Parts to be machined is fastened to the machine table. This table moves in the XY-Plane. As the operator faces the machine, the X-Axis moves the table left-right. The Y-Axis moves the table forward-backward.

The Y-axis is controls that same table in a front to back motion whereas the Z-axis controls the spindle up and down. On a standard 3-axis VMC, the cutter remains in the vertical direction. In VMC's additionally there can be a 4th or even 5th axis as well to increase the benefits of the VMC. The other parts of the VMC are:
