Other chemicals in plants contain different elements as well, for example chlorophyll contains magnesium and nitrogen. This means that without a source of these elements, plants cannot photosynthesise or grow properly. Plants obtain these elements in the form of mineral ions actively absorbed from the soil by root hair cells.

Compost. Adding compost decreases the pH value by 0.1 to 0.2. This helps stabilize the soil while also enriching it with iron.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency in the world. And since iron plays a vital role in carrying oxygen to cells throughout the body, deficiencies lead to fatigue, weakness, pallor, and anemia. Memory and cognitive problems are common symptoms when iron levels get too low. There are two kinds of iron. Plant iron = non-heme iron.
