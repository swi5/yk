## Coal Dust: What Is It, And Why Is It Dangerous?
Coal is an extremely brittle mineral, and both the extraction and refinement processes produce a fine powder known as coal dust. Coal is deliberately pulverized for use as fossil fuel, and this process also produces a substantial output of coal dust. Finally, mining, transportation and even the mechanical handling of coal can create coal dust.

A dust is considered explosible if there is a flame propagation after igniting the dust/air mixture resulting in a pressure rise in a closed vessel. This test is conducted in the Hartmann 1.2 Liter Vessel. The sample is tested over a range of concentrations and is submitted to a continuous induction spark as an ignition source.

Avoid the secondary dust explosion A primary dust explosion (deflagration) occurs when dust that is suspended within a confined area (such as container, room, ventilation system, or piece of equipment) ignites and explodes. Depending on the amount of settled dust in the area, a small >primary</b> explosion may cause powerful secondary dust explosions.

Most coals failed to ignite at all in 21% v/v O2 in CO2, but an increase to 30 or 35% v/v O2 gave ignition patterns similar to those in air. In addition, the minimum ignition concentration decreased with increase in O2. However, a further increase to 40% v/v O2 did not generally affect the minimum ignition concentration.
