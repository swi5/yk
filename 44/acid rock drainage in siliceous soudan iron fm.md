## Acid rock drainage and rock weathering in Antarctica: important sources 
Here we describe biogeochemical processes that lead to the generation of acid rock drainage (ARD) and rock weathering on the Antarctic landmass and describe why they are important sources of iron into the Antarctic Ocean. During three expeditions,, we examined three sites on the South Shetland Islands in Antarctica.

##  Technical Document: Acid Mine Drainage Prediction - US EPA
Acid Mine Drainage Prediction compares acid rock drainage factors of waste rock piles and tailings impoundments. In examining this table, it is important to note that diffusion of oxygen into water is slow and, therefore, oxidation of iron sulfide is inhibited until the water level drops, which can occur periodically or seasonally in some cases.

## Acid mine drainage
Acid mine drainage, acid and metalliferous drainage (AMD), or acid rock drainage (ARD) is the outflow of acidic water from metal mines or coal mines.. Acid rock drainage occurs naturally within some environments as part of the rock weathering process but is exacerbated by large-scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large construction activities, usually within rocks

Treatment Step: De-carbonation. The first step in the acid mine drainage flowsheet is de-carbonation. In many cases, chemical consumption is the number one operating cost of an acid mine drainage treatment system. As such, it is critical that chemical usage be optimized.

## Chris Popham - Acid Rock Drainage and Acid Mine Drainage: Processes 
By Chris Popham. Acid rock drainage is the process by which sulphide minerals decompose when exposed to oxygen to yield aqueous acidic products. As mining frequently exposes sulphides and the workings underground require dewatering the resultant acid mine drainage may become large scale and problematic.

• Acid rock drainage may be found at coal mines, hard rock mines, or construction sites that disturb sulfide rock.  Ferric iron is able to act on sulfide rock to make much more acid than natural weathering, and will act even where no oxygen is present, such as under water. When this reaction occurs, pH often drops to 2, and in some places

## General Information on Metal Leaching and Acid Rock Drainage
The acid in ARD can leach metals from surrounding rocks causing drainage that has high amounts of dissolved metals (such as iron, aluminum, copper, lead, silver, zinc). This is called metal leaching (ML). Other metals can also be leached from react in non-acidic drainage (such as selenium, zinc, molybdenum, nickel, arsenic and antimony).
