Limestone should, however, be added in appropriate amounts to prevent toxicity. Improving soil quality: Limestone is used for restoring the acidic soil. Crops cannot withstand highly acidic soil since it hinders their growth. Limestone can thus be added to lands with highly acidic soils. It will help in the neutralization of the acidic content.

## Limestone - Minerals Education Coalition
Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

## Is Limestone a Good Building Material?
Limestone Has Dependability. Limestone is one of the most durable options out of all building materials. It's strong and dense, and contains few pores. Less pores make it harder for the stone to break, and allow it to withstand abrasion and freeze-thaw. It's also weather resistant, making it the perfect option no matter the climate you're in.

Limestone is widely used for aesthetic purposes, but it does have some drawbacks. It's a porous product, which means it's great for drainage uses - hence its popularity in gardens and pathways. But this porosity also means it's easily stained when it comes to rust, spilled paints, greases or acids.
