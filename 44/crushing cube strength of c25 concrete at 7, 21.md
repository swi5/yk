Strength: 20 Newtons after 28 days. Concrete at this strength is often applied on domestic floors and foundations where the weight of overall structures on the concrete will be lighter. C20 is ideal for domestic workshop and garage bases as well as driveways and internal floor slabs. GRADE: C25 CONCRETE. Strength: 25 Newtons after 28 days.

## Concrete Strength at 7 Days - CivilWeb Spreadsheets
Typically one of these cube tests will be a 7 day cube strength. Concrete strength gain curves typically follow an equation similar to the below with two constants p and q. With two early age test results such as one at 3 days and a concrete strength at 7 days, these values can be input into this equation and the two simultaneous equations can
