 · Ore processing in IC² is a multi-stage process, requiring several machines in order to get the maximum possible yield from each individual ore. The best ore yield comes from a three-stage process. The first stage is a necessity; the second or third may optionally be skipped, but will reduce yield.

Jaw and gyratory crushers are used for initial size reduction to convert big rocks into small stones. This is generally followed by a cone crusher. A combination of rod mill and ball mills are then used if the ore must be ground below 325 mesh (45 μm). Instead of grinding the ore dry, slurry is used as feed for rod or ball mills, to avoid dusting.

Aluminum is the third most abundant element on Earth's surface. Only oxygen and silicon are more common. Earth's crust to a depth of 16 km (10 miles) contains 8 percent aluminum. Aluminum has a strong tendency to combine with other common elements and so rarely occurs in nature in the metallic form. Its compounds, however, are an important constituent of virtually all common rocks.

## types of machines for breaking of ores
PLAY. is the cheapest and easiest type of surface mining. Machines dig the holes or explosives may be used to break up especially large rocks. Then the ore is extracted from the holes. The mineral ore is taken out layer by layer, and the hole just keeps getting bigger as each layer of ore is removed.

## Review on Beneficiation Techniques and Reagents Used for Phosphate Ores
Phosphate ore is an important raw material for manufacturing fertilizers and phosphorous chemical products. While most of the phosphate resources cannot be directly treated as feed stock due to the low grade of P2O5 and high content of impurities. In order to obtain a qualified phosphate concentrate, the beneficiation of the low-grade phosphate ore is, hence, of great necessity.
