## How Does Being Near a Granite Mine Impact Real Estate Values?
Granite mining uses water for hydraulic drilling and to keep dust down. The water can wash mine waste into local waterways, affecting fishing and drinking water and putting heavy demands on the area water supply. Mining opponents say mine pollution from diesel trucks only make the problems worse.

Mining subsidence is the surface impact of collapsing overlying strata into mined-out voids. Subsidence may manifest itself in the form of sinkholes or troughs. Sinkholes are usually associated with the collapse of a portion of a mine. Sinkholes or depressions interrupt surface water drainage patterns, affecting ponds, streams, and wetlands.
