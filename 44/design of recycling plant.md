## Plastic waste as a resource, how design can shape  - LifeGate
How design can tackle the plastics crisis. Of course, design alone can't solve the problem, given the immense consequences of myopic industrial decision-making and inadequate recovery and recycling policies.Of the 90 billion tonnes of raw materials (minerals, fossil fuels, metals and biomass) consumed worldwide each year, only 9 per cent is reused, and in Europe less than a tenth of the 50

Plastic Recycling Plant Design 3D Drawing Thirdly, in the dedusting system, the dust chemical removing tank, ceramic ring filtering system and alkali sprayers are used to dedust the hot smoke from reactor. So more than 95% of the dust would be removed. The released gas is pollution-free and can be discharged in the air directly.

## Water recycling plants with resin demineralisation plants
The use of an ion exchange resin demineralization plant to create a zero-wastewater treatment system is a well-established reality.. Zero discharge in water purification plants is the design of a plant that treats water and reuses it within its production.. Pentacque, thanks to its experience, offers zero discharge purification plants providing resin water demineralization plants divided by
