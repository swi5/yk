## Used air separation plants for saletraktor-estate
The major cost associated with the separation of air is the cost of electricity to compress the inlet air, which normally comprises 95% of the utility costs of a cryogenic plant. Thus, the goal of the design is to minimize the cost of compression. Process Description Figure 1 shows a BFD of the overall process.

## Bitumen Extraction Explained | Oil Sands Magazine
This aerated bitumen droplet is relatively light and will float to the top of the gravity separation vessel. The coarse sand particles contained in the slurry are heavy and will immediately sink to the bottom. This large difference in density is why gravity separation works so well for recovering bitumen from mined oil sands.

This rudimentary piece of mineral processing equipment uses pulses of water to suspend the particles in water. As the pulses dissipate, the particles settle in the bottom of the jig. Particles with a higher specific gravity (like gold) settle faster than those with a lower specific gravity, effectively separating the gold so it can be collected.
