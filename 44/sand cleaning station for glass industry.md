## Wet Substrate Surface Cleaning - MKS
Originally developed by workers at Sony, SCROD cleaning has been shown to remove 87% of aluminum oxide particles, 97% of silicon nitride particles, and 99.5% of polystyrene latex particles from a substrate surface. This is nearly an order of magnitude more efficient particle removal than can be achieved using a standard SC-1 clean.
