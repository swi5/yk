Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and further developed by Gates in 1881 (they were commonly referred to as a 'Gate's crushers' in the early years). A primary crusher is designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines. Gyratory crushers typically crush to reduce the size of aggregate to a maximum
