Grinding tools, as the name implies, are machines used for grinding. Grinding is possible because of the presence of the so-called abrasive wheel. This is the main part of the grinding tool used for cutting. The role of the abrasive wheel is to make a cut on a particular surface of the material or work piece through the process known as shear deformation.
