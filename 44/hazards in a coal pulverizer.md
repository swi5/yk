## Fire and Explosion Hazards in Cement Manufacturing Industries
Coal is often the main fuel source used to heat the cement kiln. Coal pulverizers are required to grind the coal from the bulk storage size to a smaller particle diameter to use in the kiln. Coal pulverizers significantly reduce the mean particle size of the coal, drastically increasing the fire/explosion hazard risk.

## coal pulverizer safety
Safety systems for coal pulverizers - Patent - Europe . A safety control system for a coal pulverizer utilizes signals (20,22) representing net oxygen and carbon monoxide measurements of the pulverizer atmosphere. A signal (50) representing the rate of carbon monoxide change is derived form the signal (22) by a derivative controller (48).

## Coil Pulverizers for Boilers - Bright Hub Engineering
Pulverized coal is the most efficient way of using coal in a steam generator. The coal is ground so that about 70 % will pass through 200 mesh (0.075 mm) and 99 % will pass through 50 mesh (0.300 mm). A pulverized coal boiler can be easily adapted for other fuels like gas if required later without much difficulty.

Pulverised coal (PC) combustion is the most widely used technology for utility-scale power generation in the world. In PC boilers, coal is ground into fine particles (∼100 μm) and then injected with heated combustion air through a number of burners into the lower part of the furnace.

Coal for Power Plants. The coal fired power plant converts energy in coal to electricity. The basic input into the system is the fuel that is coal. All other systems and equipment only aid in this conversion process. Before going into the details, let us look at the quantity of coal processed in a power plant.
