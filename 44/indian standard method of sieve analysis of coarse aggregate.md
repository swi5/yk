The analysis is conducted to determine the grading of material proposed for use as aggregates. The term fineness modulus (F.M) is a ready index of coarseness or fineness of material. It is an empirical factor obtained by adding the cumulative percentages of aggregates retained on each of the standard sieves and dividing this sum arbitrarily by

## Sieve analysis of Fine and Coarse aggregatesd
There are two common methods for sieve analysis of aggregates, dry sieve and sieve analysis using washed aggregate. Here we just describe the wet (washed) method because as experienced in laboratory the more accurate type of sieve is washed method.  (For Fine and Coarse aggregate the material passing sieve 75µm(No 200) is ignored,other

## Importance of Sieve Analysis | Sieve Analysis of Aggregates
Method: Cleanse the sieves of sieve shaker with cleaning brush to check whether any particles are blocked in the openings. Note down the weight of each sieve and receiving pan. Dry the specimen in oven for 3-4 minutes to obtain the dried specimen (overlook, if the specimen is already dried). Weigh the specimen and note down its weight.

## Isconcrete Mix Design - Indian Standard Method
This method of concrete mix design consist of following 11 steps. Design specification. Testing of materials. Calculating target strength for mix proportioning. Selecting water/cement ratio. Calculating water content. Calculating cement content. Finding out volume proportions for Coarse aggregate & fine aggregate.
