## Limestone
Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium

ABSTRACT. Limestone for portland cement must be beneficiated to produce uniform raw material. for the kiln. Careful quarrying and selective recovery are factors in this process, but. the chief aspects of beneficiation are "in plant" processes, such as crushing and screening, washing, grinding, flotation, and heavy-media separation.
