## Investigating the outcome for South African coal supply to the domestic 
The South African coal industry. The South African coal industry comprises four main markets (SACR 2011): . 1. The market for coal supplied to Eskom, the state-owned power generation and distribution utility: The coal supplied to this market is typically of lower energy grade and higher ash content, and has historically been sourced from large mines under cost-plus Footnote 1 constracts.

## Is the Coal Mining Industry of South Africa Under Threat?
According to Henk Langenhoven of the Minerals Council SA, the 14% increase was a result of record-high coals global coal prices in addition to factors inside Eskom. For some time, Eskom has demanded a minimum of 50% black shareholding in suppliers, in comparison to the 26% as required by the mining industry.
