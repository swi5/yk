LED tapes generally draw 12V or 24V of power (sometimes 36V, although this is less typical). Because the UK's mains-electricity grid supplies a voltage in the range 220V-240V, any installation of LED strip lights will need one or more electrical transformers to step its input voltage down to the right power.

## Field-scale investigation of pulverized coal mill power consumption 
Twenty field-scale tests were conducted in a 28 MW pulverized coal power plant in Healy, Alaska, to examine mill power consumption in relation to coal grind size. The intent in this field-scale study was to verify if grind size truly impacted power consumption by a detectable amount. The regression model developed from the data indicates that grind size does impact mill power consumption, with
