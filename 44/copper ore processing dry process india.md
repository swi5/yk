## Copper Processing: The Quest for Efficiency at Scale | E & MJ
Advances in copper processing technologies from the past 30 years nearly all fall into the category of "the bigger, the better" — higher volume flotation cells, massive high-pressure grinding rolls (HPGRs), super-sized concentrators. For some time now, we have been chasing economies of scale, which will soon cease to exist.

## Turning Copper Ore into Copper: What are the Processes?
The process of extracting copper for its ore is quite complex and varied. It largely depends on the type of ore in question, particularly whether it is a sulfide or oxide type. Copper mining has typically been performed through open-pit mining, where stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the ground over time.

Copper ore processing. According to the metallurgy process, the copper ore is divided into three natural types by the ratio of copper oxide and copper sulfide. That is, sulfide ore, containing less than 10% copper oxide; oxidized ore, containing more than 30% copper oxide; mixed ore, containing 10% to 30% of copper oxide.

Dry processing is linked to the quality of the iron ore extracted from mining. In Carajas, as the iron content is already high (above 64%), the ore is only crushed and sieved, so it can be classified by size (granulometry). In Minas Gerais, the average content is 40% iron, contained in rocks known as itabirites.
