## Why is Concrete Strong in Compression? (5 reasons)
Jan 5, 2021The main reason why concrete is weak in tension and strong in compression is because of its composition and structure. Under compressive stress, the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ), which is the weakest link in concrete, tends to transfer the stress from one aggregate to the other. The strength requirement in this is low.

Although the compression test is the conventional and most accurate method, it is destructive and costly. Thanks to the rebound test it is possible to obtain approximate values of the compressive strength of cured concrete. The sclerometer produces readings in psi, which is a unit of stress (pressure), the nature of which is similar to compression.

Compressive Strength of Concrete at 7 days and 28 days. Concrete continues to hydrate and to gain strength for years after it is poured. Concrete gains strength due to the chemistry of the hydration of the cement. Essentially the cement continues to hydrate while there is moisture available which it can simply take from the air in most cases.

## Flexural Strength of Concrete
As per IS 456 2000, the flexural strength of the concrete can be computed by the characteristic compressive strength of the concrete. Flexural strength of concrete = 0.7 . sqrt(fck) Where, fck is the characteristic compressive strength of concrete in MPa. Characteristic compressive strength (MPa) Flexural Strength (MPa) 20: 3.13: 25: 3.50: 30:

## Compressive Strength Of Concrete - KPSTRUCTURES
The compressive strength of Concrete defined as the resistance to failure under the action of compressive forces. Especially for concrete, compressive strength is an important parameter to determine the performance of the Concrete/Materials during service conditions. Strength of concrete is its most valuable property that determines the amount

## Cube test procedure & result for compressive strength of concrete 
A) Sampling Stage of cubes for compressive strength test. 1) Find out a levelled surface at the site & place the cube moulds. 2) Oil should be applied inside the cube mould after cleaning it properly. 3) Fill the fresh concrete inside the cube mould after checking the Slump test. 4) The concrete should be filled in three layers and each layer
