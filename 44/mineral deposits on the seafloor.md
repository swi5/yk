Seafloor massive sulphide deposits are potential resources for base and precious metals (Cu-Pb-Zn ± Ag ± Au), but difficulties in estimating precise reserves and assessing environmental impacts hinder exploration and commercial mining. Here, we report petrological and geochemical properties of sulphide chimneys less than 2 years old that formed where scientific boreholes vented hydrothermal

## Electrical Methods in the Exploration of Seafloor Mineral Deposits 
Abstract. The range of electrical experiments which have been carried out at sea in order to learn about the resistivity (or conductivity) structure of the seabed is reviewed. Some of these experiments were directly related to mineral exploration. Others could be modified to make them more suitable for mineral exploration and appraisal.

## Hydrothermal Mineral Deposit - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Hydrothermal circulation and venting may produce hydrothermal mineral deposits at and below the ocean floor. Sulfide deposits commonly form proximal to the source of venting, and oxides form farther afield or in cooler systems. Of these, seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits are of economic interest, primarily for copper, zinc, gold, and

## Gold deposits map usanhof-vulkaneifel
Gold may form in exhalative deposits formed on the sea floor associated with Archean basaltic sequences known as greenstone belts. It may form in veins associated with large granite intrusions associated with mountain building. It may also form in veins formed along major fault zones. Gold in veins is associated with sulfides, quartz, and calcite.

## Deep-Ocean Mineral Deposits: Metal Resources and Windows into Earth 
The Solwara 1 seafloor massive sulfide deposit (off Papua New Guinea) is relatively small, with an inferred total mineral resource of ~1.4 million tonnes at a grade of ~8% Cu and ~6 g/t Au. By comparison, ancient volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits on land can contain resources of >150 million tonnes.

Seafloor spreading is an oceanographic phenomena which occurs at the mid ocean ridge. In this process a new oceanic crust is formed by the volcanic activity. It is a geological process that occur as a result of mantle convection. The hot magma liberates which causes the volcanic eruption.

## Seafloor Mining - Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
Seafloor Mining Hot, buoyant, mineral-laden fluids rise from deep within ocean crust and mix with cold seawater. That triggers the precipitation of minerals that form deposits near and on the seafloor. Precipitating minerals also form seafloor "chimneys," and mineral particles in the fluids venting at the seafloor make the fluids look like smoke.

## Rapid growth of mineral deposits at artificial seafloor hydrothermal 
The high growth rate reaching the 15 m height within 25 months is attributed to the large hydrothermal vent more than 50 cm in diameter created by the borehole, which induced slow mixing with the ambient seawater and enhanced efficiency of sulphide deposition. These observations suggest the possibility of cultivating seafloor sulphide deposits

These metal-containing deposits are located around mid-ocean ridges where the sea floor is, or was, volcanically active. Mineral-rich superhot water from underlying magma meets cold deep seawater and forms a crust on the seafloor at a depth that is often richer in minerals, particularly copper, than can be found in land deposits.
