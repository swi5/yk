## Beneficiation of Iron Ore - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Beneficiation of Iron Ore and the treatment of magnetic iron taconites, stage grinding and wet magnetic separation is standard practice.This also applies to iron ores of the non-magnetic type which after a reducing roast are amenable to magnetic separation. All such plants are large tonnage operations treating up to 50,000 tons per day and ultimately requiring grinding as fine as minus 500

##  Iron Ore Pelletization Technology and its Environmental Impact 
The process of pelletization enables converting Iron Ore Fines into "Uniformed Sized Iron Ore Pellets" that can be charged into the blast furnaces or for Production of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI). Pellets are uniform size, with purity of 63%- 65% contributing to faster reduction and high metallization rates.
