Conclusion From the experiment, we get 6.02% where it still not exceeding JKR's standard, <30%. So we can conclude that the aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. The aggregate are mild tough to have the resistance pressure under traffic wheel loads such as car, lorry, motorcycle and etc.

## differences between aggregate crushing value and aggregate
Aggregate crushing value by compressive strenth.Aggregate crushing value.Aggregate crushing value depends on the shape of agg also.Angular aggregates have a lower acv than irregular or rounded aggregates.If we cut a core out of the same agg say in the quarry and test for compressive strength will give a higher mpa value.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Standard
The aggregate crushing value (ACV) of an aggregate is the mass of material, expressed as a percentage of the test sample. which is crushed finer than a 2,36 mm sieve when a sample of aggregate passing the 13,2 mm and retained on the 9,50 mm sieve is subjected to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load of 400 kN. 2 APPARATUS 2.1 An

## Standard of Crushing Value of Coarse Aggregates for Permeable Asphalt 
The crushing values of two different lithologic coarse aggregates were measured under different pressures, 400 kN or 600 kN, respectively. The crushing value criterion of coarse aggregates used in the PA mixture was suggested to be no greater than 16% after comparative analysis.
