## High reduction ratio crushing in conical/gyratory crushers
A ratio comparison of the size of the feed material to the crusher and the crushed product size of the material is referred to as the reduction ratio. Typically, 80 percent passing size or 50 percent passing size is used. Although the reduction ratio could be 6 60 1 or more, a typical one should be about 3 to 1.

Crushing ratio, is the total reduction from feed to products, is a factor that sets the need- ed number of crushing stages. Also, the rock type effiects on the reduction ratio, the harder the rock, the lower the reduction ratio in each crushing stage. In the other words, more stages are needed while crushing harder rock com- pared to softer rock.
