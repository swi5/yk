## What are the Types of Gold Mining - Physical Gold
Gold mining is a large commercial operation undertaken by mining companies who fund their operations through the sale of gold as well, as money raised from the stock markets. Investors often invest in gold mining companies, as a form of paper gold investment. Let us take a quick look at the four main types of gold mining methods.

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## Mining industry of Egypt
Mining in Egypt has had a long history that dates back to predynastic times.Active mining began in Egypt around 3000 BCE. Egypt has substantial mineral resources, including 48 million tons of tantalite (fourth largest in the world), 50 million tons of coal, and an estimated 6.7 million ounces of gold in the Eastern Desert. The total real value of minerals mined was about LE 102 million (US$18.

Sometime, mining companies during the first months of operation employ this method to study zones that were not studied well during the exploration program. Results are different. For example, by employing a core drilling program the average gold content was 5 g/t. however, the second method on the same place gave higher values, 10 g/t.

Sluicing. Sluicing is another small-scale gold mining method that became very popular during the 19 th Century. Gold imbued sediment and water is passed through a sluice system that contains 'riffles' or small ridges. These small ridges trap heavy gold and allow other sediments to wash over. This, in theory, leaves behind relatively pure

Jan 12, 2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold.

In this method, ore is mined in horizontal slices, starting from the bottom to the top of the stope. The broken ore is left in the mined-out stope and serves as a support to the stope walls and a working platform for mining the ore above.
