## This type of refractory mortar comes dry in bags and is not subject to 
With refractory cement recipe, it's a much easy to get it. First of all, the raw materials should be prepared. They are bauxite and limestone. And next step is the manufacturing process. The raw materials are ready to be sintered in order to make them into clinker. The last step is to grind the clinker into powder. This is the recipe.

Dry grinding requires approximately 30 % more energy / wt. of ground material. Dry mills need more mill volume than comparable wet mills. However, the increased metal wear of the grinding media and the mill liners for wet grinding, equalizes the additional energy costs of dry grinding procedures ~ 30 - 40 % of wear costs in wet grinding.
