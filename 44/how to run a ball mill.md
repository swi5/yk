## How to Make a Ball Mill With Lego and a Pvc Pipe --includes Digital 
Now, A ball mill, rock tumbler, lapidary polisher ect, is a machine which rorates a barrel full of media, like steel or ceramic balls / beads which as the name suggests, tumble over each other. Any meterials caught between the media get grinded, milled and smahed into super fine dust, and if given the time, even go micronic. I used my own mill primarily to make aluminium powder, the most

## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. T
