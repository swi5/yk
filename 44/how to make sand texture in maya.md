## Texture mapping | Maya 2018 | Autodesk Knowledge Network
To apply a texture to an object, you map the texture to an attribute on the object's material. The attribute to which the texture is connected determines how the texture is used and how it affects the final results. Maya has a number of textures that you can map onto objects. For more information on these textures, see 2D and 3D textures.
