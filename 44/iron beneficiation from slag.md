These ores subject to beneficiation yield a concentrate containing 61.5 to 66% Fe at 62 to 86% yield. In case of BHQ ore, column flotation technique has been adopted to obtain a concentrate of 66% Fe at 44.7% yield.

## AP1297A - Beneficiation of titania slag by oxidation and reduction 
This invention relates to a method of treating titania slag to increase the leachability of impurities from the slat comprising the steps of sizing the titania slag to a particle size from 75 to 850 µm; oxidising the sized slag particles at a temperature from about 700 0C and above but below 950 0C allowing the iron present in the slag to concentrate at the exposed surfaces of the slag
