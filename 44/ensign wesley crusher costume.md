## My Analysis of the Problems with Ens. Wesley Crusher
May 2, 2003. Location: Kingston, NY. Meh. Wesley was a play for the teen demographic, someone youth were supposed to identify with somehow, like Chekov in TOS. If Star Trek were more like, say, Space Patrol, no one would question it. But for better or worse, TNG fans were too sophisticated and it stuck in their craws.

## The Emperor's Will Event! : r/sto
Called it again when they said the emperor would be revealed in this new story arc. They made it pretty obvious from the start. The only problem was getting Wheaton on board, but that guy's such a trek nerd anyway, I couldn't imagine him saying no to playing the video game villain of mirror Wesley/Emperor Crusher. It just makes sense.

I do however want to see Wesley Crusher turn up on one of the nu-treks at some point. Theres options.

## Wesley Crusher | Memory Delta Wiki | Fandom
Ensign Wesley Crusher in 2366. Later that year, Wes took his exam on Starbase 515, passed, and was offered a position at the Academy. His entry had to be moved to early 2367 when he remained aboard the Enterprise to help locate Commander Riker and Deanna Troi after they were captured by the Ferengi. Thanks to his actions, Riker and Troi were rescued, and Picard field-promoted Wesley to ensign.

Accuracy: + 290 Crit Bonus: + Evasion: + 190. This card completed the trifecta of all Wesley Crusher cards being pretty terrible. Well okay, there is some small merit with Ensign Crusher here having a less-than-average voyaging score. But really it's only good if you don't already have literally any of the other 3 SCI or ENG cards.
