## Why do we need beneficiation? Explained by FAQ Blog
Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both. How do minerals process? Crushing and grinding are the two primary comminution processes. Crushing is normally carried out on "run-of-mine

## What is the Beneficiation Process?
The beneficiation process can be defined as a treatment process of ore which results in a more concentrated form of the product. It is often used in the preparation of iron ore for smelting. This is an essential process as it helps improve the yield from a deposit of ore, thereby increasing the potential profits that can be obtained from the

## Coal Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Currently, the wet coal beneficiation process is the predominant method for coal upgrading. The wet beneficiation processes include heavy media separation, cyclone (water only), froth flotation, and spiral separation [23,24]. The use of these technologies depends on the particle size of the feed and the quality of the product required.

Coal beneficiation is a physical process that separates burnable coal from associated un-burnable mineral matter, also known as ash, or rejects. High ash content is inherent in Indian coals, the ash having been deposited concurrently with the coal in the paleo-depositional environment. Due to the close specific gravity of coal and ash

The said method of separation is based on the differences in the physical properties between coal and gangue minerals, such as the grain density, size, and shape.
