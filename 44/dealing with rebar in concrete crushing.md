## What Does Rebar Do For Concrete? And When To Use It - Modern Design
Rebar's primary purpose is to increase the tensile strength of concrete. This additional strength helps it resist cracking and compensates for concrete's inherent weakness. With greater tensile strength, concrete is able to resist breaking under tension which means it can safely span larger distances.

The desired concrete crushing failures shown in Figs. 1.24 and 1.25 can only be achieved if IC, CDC and PE debonding can be prevented from occurring before the design load to cause concrete crushing. However, this may not always be possible; in which case, it may be necessary to design for either IC or CDC debonding to occur at the design load so that concrete crushing will not occur.
