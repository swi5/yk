If we multiply the length of bars by this unit weight, we will get the total weight of steel bars. For example, the total weight of 1000 meter long 20mm ø steel bar is, 1000 x 2.469 = 2469 kg. Using the same method we can calculate the unit weight of different steel bars. Here I have calculated in meter but we can also calculate in feet.

The density of concrete varies with its exact composition, but averages around 2,400 kg per cubic meter, or 150lbs per cubic foot. In fresh water, the apparent weight would be a little more, 87.6 pounds, because a cubic foot of fresh water weighs only 62.4 pounds so provides less upward force.

Many of the commonly used interpolation methods, including the ones we learn about in this Chapter (Nearest Neighbor, IDW, Kriging), are based on the same principle, where a predicted value is a weighted average of neighboring points.Weight are usually inveresely related to distance, i.e., as distance increases the weight (importance) of the point decreases.

A cubic inch of concrete is pretty small but we can do the calculations based on the weight of a cubic foot of concrete. First of all, there are 1728 cubic inches in 1 cubic foot. If 1 cubic foot of concrete weighs 150 lbs then you divide that by 1728 to get the weight per cubic inch. 150 / 1728 = .087 pounds or 1.

## Liquefied natural gas
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas (predominantly methane, CH 4, with some mixture of ethane, C 2 H 6) that has been cooled down to liquid form for ease and safety of non-pressurized storage or transport.It takes up about 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state (at standard conditions for temperature and pressure).. LNG is odorless, colorless, non-toxic and non-corrosive.
