## Sieve Analysis of Fine and Coarse Aggregate
The analysis is conducted to determine the grading of material proposed for use as aggregates. The term fineness modulus (F.M) is a ready index of coarseness or fineness of material. It is an empirical factor obtained by adding the cumulative percentages of aggregates retained on each of the standard sieves and dividing this sum arbitrarily by

## Fine Aggregate Sieve Analysis - intotheBOX
Fine aggregate sieve analysis is the method to determine the distribution of different sizes of particles in the fine aggregate samples. As the name suggests, a sample of fine aggregate is passed through different sets of sieves & the quantity of material retained or passed is noted. Their percentages are then calculated to evaluate the

A sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used in civil engineering and chemical engineering to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material by allowing the material to pass through a series of sieves of progressively smaller mesh size and weighing the amount of material that is stopped by each sieve as a fraction of the whole mass.

The aggregate fraction from 4.75 to 75 micron is referred to as fine aggregates. Fine aggregate is the sand used in mortars, coarse aggregates is the broken stone or gravel, and all in one aggregate is the combination of fine and coarse aggregates. The coarse aggregates unless mixed with fine aggregates do not produce good quality of concrete.

## Importance of Sieve Analysis | Sieve Analysis of Aggregates
Method: Cleanse the sieves of sieve shaker with cleaning brush to check whether any particles are blocked in the openings. Note down the weight of each sieve and receiving pan. Dry the specimen in oven for 3-4 minutes to obtain the dried specimen (overlook, if the specimen is already dried). Weigh the specimen and note down its weight.

Higher the value of FM,coarser will be the aggregate. Sieve Analysis. 3- It also indicates the surface area of the particles. Lower the surface area of the aggregate, the required amount of fresh cement paste to cover the aggregate particles will be less and thus less water is required. 4- Larger value of FM is preferred for fine aggregates.
