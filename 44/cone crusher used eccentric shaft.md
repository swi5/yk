## Easy Stroke Adjustment For GP300 Cones | Agg-Net
Traditionally, stroke adjustment in a cone crusher has not been used to optimize production in crushing plants. This is mainly due to the difficulty in accessing the eccentric bushing, as the top frame and main shaft need to be dismantled. However, the stroke influences cone crusher performance in several significant ways.

The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber - it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action.
