## Aluminum - Oxygen Not Included Wiki
Aluminum is a metal refined from Aluminum Ore. Aluminum has high thermal conductivity of 205, which is higher than Diamond and second only to Thermium. This makes it an ideal material for heat-conducting Metal Tiles, Tempshift Plates, and Radiant Liquid and Gas Pipes. However, with only half the melting point of Iron, it is not suitable for extremely high temperature environments. As a Refined

The mining, processing and refining of bauxite into raw aluminum is energy-intensive and has a major impact on the environment. By contrast, recycling aluminum uses only 5% of the energy required to extract raw aluminum from ore. Rainforest destruction for bauxite mining. A significant share of bauxite deposits can be found in the tropics.

Aluminium comes from an ore called bauxite, taking its name from the town in Southern France where it was first mined commercially - Les Baux. Although it's an element, aluminium never occurs in its metallic form in nature. It is found in compound form in rocks and soil. The world's leading producing areas of bauxite are South and Central

## Energy needed to produce aluminum
After alumina is extracted from bauxite ore, further processing called 'smelting' is necessary to convert it into aluminum. In this process, alumina is dissolved in a solution and a strong electric current is applied. This process has generally remained unchanged since its invention in 1886.
