## Precipitated Calcium Carbonate - Multifunctional Additive for PVC
Production of Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Precipitated calcium carbonate is produced using the most economic process existing today. Limestone is converted into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide by means of calcination at temperatures above 900°C. To ensure a high level of purity, the calcination process is carried out using natural gas.

Chemical reactions of calcium carbonate: Calcium carbonate is the average salt formed by strong base (calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2) and weak acid (carbonic acid H2CO3). Aqueous solutions of CaCO3 have a weak alkaline reaction. Chemical properties of potassium hydroxide are similar to the properties of the carbonates of other metals.

25.3 g of Sodium carbonate Na 2 CO 3 is dissolved in enough water to make 250 mL of solution. If sodium carbonate dissociates completely, molar concentration of sodium ion, Na + and carbonate ion CO2− 3 CO 3 2 - are respectively (Molar mass of Na 2 CO 3 = 106 g mol -1) 1. 0.955 M and 1.910 M 2. 1.910 M and 0.955 M 3. 1.90 M and 1.910 M. carbonate) Solid Calcium carbonate occurs naturally as

## Calcium Carbonate - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) is a substance widely used for various purposes, for example, as a filler and pigment material not only in paper, plastics, rubbers,  However, the production of reactive calcium from limestone usually generates an amount of CO 2 equal to or larger than what is chemically stored in carbonates (1).
