## What does zincked mean?f
What is zinc used for? Most zinc is used to galvanise other metals, such as iron, to prevent rusting. Galvanised steel is used for car bodies, street lamp posts, safety barriers and suspension bridges. Large quantities of zinc are used to produce die-castings, which are important in the automobile, electrical and hardware industries.

Centuries before it was identified as an element, zinc was used to make brass (an alloy of zinc and copper) and for medicinal purposes.Metallic zinc and zinc oxide were produced in India sometime between the 11th and 14th centuries and in China in the 17th century, although the discovery of pure metallic zinc is credited to the German chemist Andreas Marggraf, who

## Zinc Mining - Atlantis Project - Ancient Civilization Search
Zinc in India. It is believed that India was the first country to smelt zinc. Lead and zinc were mined in Rajasthan, India as early as 1000 BC. The mines at Zawar are believed to be the world's oldest. Alchemical texts from the region can be dated back to 500 BC explaining how to smelt zinc. The Jains settled in Zawar and used Zinc extensively.
