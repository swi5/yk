Cryogenic air separation units (ASUs) then take the air through another cycle of treatment to extract gases of a higher purity of volumes in excess of 4,000 t/d per ASU. This involves air liquefaction and distillation. The boiling points of pure gases are -183 o C for oxygen and -196 o C for nitrogen at atmospheric pressure.

This refers to ammonia, produced through a 100% carbon-free, renewable process. One way to achieve this is through the Haber process, which combines liquid hydrogen elements from water with nitrogen extracted from the air. These two elements are merged under high pressure during the Haber process to manufacture ammonia.

Atmospheric gases (nitrogen, oxygen, argon) are produced using a process known as air separation. Air separation plants are typically referred to as air separation units, or ASUs. Cryogenic air separation is capable of producing large quantities of high purity gas and/or liquid phase product, which is then easily stored, transported or used.

The first process step in any air separation plant is filtering and compressing air (most commonly, to about 90 psig, or 6 bar). The compressed air then is cooled to close-to-ambient temperature by passing through water- or air-cooled heat exchangers. Sometimes, it is cooled a bit more in a mechanical refrigeration system.
