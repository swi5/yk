## A pantropical assessment of deforestation caused by industrial mining 
Compared with other causes of tropical deforestation, such as crop production or livestock farming, mining so far is a minor driver, but its growing importance has been emphasized in various case studies in the Amazon region (17, 20, 21) and in India ().The significance and geographical pattern of deforestation induced by mining across tropical forests worldwide are yet unknown.

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Haematite and magnetite are the most commonly found iron ore minerals. The smelting process allows the iron ore to be heated with carbon. The carbon combines with the oxygen and carries it away, leaving behind iron. Blast furnaces are so hot which is why they melt the iron, and drain it off to be poured into moulds to form bars, called ingots.

Iron Ore. Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted.; India has large iron ore reserves. It occurs in various geological formations but major economic deposits are found in volcano-sedimentary Banded Iron Formation (BIF) from the Precambrian age.; Magnetite is the finest iron ore with a very high content of iron up to 72 percent.

## 5 Iron Uses in Plants for Growth and Fertilizer - AZ Chemistry
1. Iron for the production of energy in plants. Iron uses in plants as one of components in several enzymes and pigments. It helps reducing the quantity of nitrate and sulfate and produces energy for photosynthetic organisms. It also helps form chlorophyll or green pigments found in algae and plants.

## Iron ore mining and dressing - tec-science
An ironworks (or iron works) is an industrial plant for the production of steel from iron ores! Before the iron ores can be fed to the ironworks, they must first be mined (ore extraction) and specially processed for the blast furnace process (ore processing). These process steps are described in more detail in the following sections.

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
