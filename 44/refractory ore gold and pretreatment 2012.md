leaching circuits, even when the ore is finely ground. The cause of low gold recoveries can be either through the presence of naturally occurring 'preg robbing' carbonaceous materials or gold physically 'locked' in sulphide minerals. The majority of gold ores are classified refractory because the gold mineralogy is contained in sulphides.

Sulphidic Refractory Gold Ore Pretreatment By Selective. Mar 01 2013 Mar 01 2013 Abstract. In sulphidic refractory gold ores fine gold particles may be highly disseminated and locked up in sulphide minerals such as pyrite and arsenopyrite. Hence pre-treating processes are necessary to extract gold for further processing methods like cyanidation.

## Pretreatment Process on Refractory Gold Ores with As - J-STAGE
It can dramatically improve gold cyanide leaching rate. Roasting has advantages of mature and reliable technology, simple operation, adaptability, etc.But it is easy to form secondary wrapping to reduce leaching rate of gold in the roasting process, and at the same time produces gases of SO 2 and As 2 O 3 polluting environment seriously. In ores with a high sulphide content this treatment

## pretreatment of refractory ores in gold leaching process congo
A sulphide ore containing 4.1 g/t gold and 17.0 g/t silvere most of which finely disseminated in pyrite, was subjected to two-stage processing for extracting these precious metals. Another successful commercial application of biohydrometallurgy is the biooxidation pretreatment of refractory sulphidic gold ores before cyanidation (Brierley and Brierley, 2001, Nestor et al., 2001
