In the recent past, coal mining has led to major changes in land use: most of the productive arable land has gradually been affected by the mining. In the Jaintia hills the mined land increased from 3.26% to 11.2% of the total area between 1975 and 2007, while the land under agriculture decreased from 2.65% to 1.43% (Sarma et al., 2010).
