## r/aldi - Has anyone gotten the Ambiano Automatic Burr Mill this week 
I'd be pissed if it was $50 like most marginal flat burr grinders. I doubt you'd get any better without going for a decent hand-crank or getting into the ~$100 conical burr options. Think of this as a value play. My regular coffee grinder needed to be replaced so I opted for the super inexpensive Ambiano Burr Mill.

## hammer mill vs a burr mill - Implement Alley Forum
Posted: Tue Sep 29, 2009 5:09 pm Post subject: Re: hammer mill vs a burr mill. A burr mill has 2 flat plates, one stationary that the grain is fed thru between and like teeth on that do the grinding. The plates or burrs lay flat and depending on number of burrs (teeth) how fine the grind. Back to top.
