## Silver: A native element, mineral, alloy, and byproduct - Geology
Most of the silver produced today is a byproduct of mining copper, lead, and zinc. The silver occurs within the ores of these metals in one of two ways: 1) substituting for one of the metal ions within the ore mineral's atomic structure; or, 2) occurring as an inclusion of native silver or a silver mineral within the ore mineral.

## Silver mining
Silver-bearing ore typically contains very little silver, with much higher percentages of copper and lead. Specific minerals include argentite (Ag 2 S), chlorargyrite ("horn silver," AgCl), polybasite (Ag, Cu) 16 Sb 2 S 11), and proustite (Ag 3 AsS 3). Silver mainly occurs as a contaminant in chalcopyrite and galena, important ores of copper and lead, respectively.

## Ore - Official A Township Tale Wiki
Every ore vein has a large silver spike extruding from the top, and is the only ore vein to have this distinct feature. The ore itself reflects this with a (albeit smaller) similar extrusion. The ingots are dark brown. Upon breaking with a pickaxe, Copper ore veins typically drop three copper ore. Copper Ore Node Copper Ore Node (Quest version)

## Silver
Its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper (which forms copper (I) oxide when heated in air to red heat) and gold. Like copper, silver reacts with sulfur and its compounds; in their presence, silver tarnishes in air to form the black silver sulfide (copper forms the green sulfate instead, while gold does not react).

## Sulfide Ore Treatment Gold - Silver - Copper - Cobalt - Zinc Recovery
A procedure was developed for recovering gold, silver, cobalt, copper, and zinc from a massive sulfide ore by a hydro-metallurgical process. The procedure consists of (1) oxygen pressure leaching; (2) iron, arsenic, and copper removal from the leach solution by precipitation; (3) selective extraction of cobalt and zinc from solution; (4) electro-deposition of the cobalt and zinc from the strip
