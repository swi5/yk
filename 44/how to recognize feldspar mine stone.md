Lunar mineralogy. Only four minerals - plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene, olivine, and ilmenite - account for 98-99% of the crystalline material of the lunar crust. (Material at the lunar surface contains a high proportion of non-crystalline material, but most of this material is glass that formed from melting of rocks containing the four major minerals.)

Feldspar minerals are some of the most abundant minerals within the Earth's crust and are a common component of rocks. Species that are rich in potassium (K) are called potassium feldspars. Orthoclase, Microcline (Amazonite), and Sanidine are potassium feldspars. Feldspars rich in sodium (Na) or calcium (Ca) are plagioclase feldspars.
