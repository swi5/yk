## Lime Cycle - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Peter A. Claisse, in Civil Engineering Materials, 2016 7.9 The lime cycle. The lime cycle is one of the most important in construction materials, and also one of the oldest chemical processes used on a large scale. The Romans produced lime in large quantities. The first process is calcination of limestone, by heating to a high temperature. This is carried out in kilns.
