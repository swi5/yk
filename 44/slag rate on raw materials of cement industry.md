Jan 2, 2021Mar 11, 2014· "Co-processing of alternate fuels and raw materials in the cement industry, therefore, presents a win-win situation for a country like India," the report states. Though the cement industry in India is taking efforts to improve energy efficiency, the use of alternate fuels and raw materials (AFR) still remains a major area of concern.

Raw mill is generally called cement raw mill, raw mill in cement plant, it refers to a common type of cement equipment in the cement plant.In the cement manufacturing process, raw mill in cement plant grind cement raw materials into the raw mix, and the raw mix is sent to the cement kiln to make cement clinker, next, clinker and other admixtures will be ground into finished cement by cement mill.

## Slag Cement for Wide Range of Applications
Curing period for slag cement is longer compared to OPC, a minimum of 14 days as recommended by IS 456:2000. The use of slag cement in concrete production reduces the rate of heat generation and improves workability. The reduction is directly proportional to that of slag content in the cement used.

## Cement Types
In the most general sense, portland cement is produced by heating sources of lime, iron, silica, and alumina to clinkering temperature (2,500 to 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit) in a rotating kiln, then grinding the clinker to a fine powder. The heating that occurs in the kiln transforms the raw materials into new chemical compounds.

## Slag as a Raw Material: Assessing the Economics - ResearchGate
The trend in the cement industry is towards ever increasing kiln capacities that have now reached clinker outputs of up to 12000 t/d. This requires mills that are capable of producing raw meal at

## Raw Material For Slag Crushing
The slag mill is the key equipment for slag grinding before re-grinding. mobile crusher for cement raw material crushing the cement production process most of the raw material to be broken such as mestone clay iron ore and coal mestone is the largest amount of raw materials for cement production the larger the particle size after mining.

Fireclay bricks are weakly acidic refractory products, which can resist the erosion of acidic slag and acid gas, and have a slightly weaker resistance to alkaline. The fastest growing import markets in Refractory Bricks for Slovakia between 2019 and 2020 were United States ($5.72M), Poland ($4.17M), and Russia ($4.14M).

## Effect of Steel Slag on Concrete Having Varying Amount of Cement
The results show that, compared with the raw steel slag, the setting time of the wet-grinding steel slag system is shortened, and the free expansion rate is increased.
