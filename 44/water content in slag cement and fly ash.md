Concrete was produced by replacing general-purpose cement with 10%, 20% and 30% of recycled glass powder. The results were compared with the control (100% Portland cement) and fly ash blend (30% fly ash) concrete. The effects of glass powder on compressive, flexural and tensile strength of concrete were evaluated.

Fly ash is a pozzolan — to make cement, just add water. Combined with lime and water, it forms a mixture that is similar to portland cement. But it is just an additive, rather than a replacement for portland cement. It is routinely used in 15 percent to 25 percent dosages in ready mix. Like slag, fly ash is not a new development in the

The introduction of 5% silica fume into concrete composition allowed to obtain frost-resistant concrete with a 45% content of fly ash in cement mass . Nanosilica is a common additive used in the composition of ash cements.  Water curing of concrete with the use of slag cements is more effective in relation to the storage of samples in sealed

## The Difference in Slag Cement and Fly Ash
Once a good relationship with a supplier is established, slag cement can be used at a higher percentage than fly ash. In most cases, slag cement can be used as a 30-50% replacement to portland cement, reducing the carbon impact of the concrete. To check for suppliers in your area, use the SCA's slag cement locator.

## Fly ash and slag in concrete - Everything About Concrete
Here is a basic mixture of 1 yard of 3000 psi concrtete. 1. 517 pounds of cement. 2. 1560 pounds of sand. 3. 1600 pounds of stone. 4. 32 - 34 gallons of water. The SLAG or FLY ASH only replace some of the CEMENT content of the yard of concrete not the sand of stone. The redi mix companies I use typically replace about 20% of the cement with slag.
