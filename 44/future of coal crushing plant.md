## why choose the mobile crusher in coal crushing plant
Traditional fixed crushing machine is based on sites, and coal needs to be transported back and forth, which is cumbersome. Thus, the mobile coal crusher plant came into being. Of course, the so-called mobile coal crusher station is nothing more than the traditional fixed crusher equipped with a driving mode.
