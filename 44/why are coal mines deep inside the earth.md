## Coal Mining -The 2 Most Basic Techniques Of Extraction
The second fundamental method of extracting coal is underground mining. This technique is used when the coal is buried deep inside the earth. The machines used for this type of coal extraction can excavate at depths of more than thousand feet. The coal itself is cut out from rocks using machinery. It is brought to the top using massive conveyor

## Fossil fuels — kidcyber
Fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals, buried deep inside the Earth for millions of years. Over a long, long time, heat and pressure has turned these remains into the fossil fuels that we call coal, oil and natural gas. Today, fossil fuels are mined and burned to release the energy stored inside them.
