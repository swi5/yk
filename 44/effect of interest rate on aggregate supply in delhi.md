Exchange Rates, Aggregate Demand, and Aggregate Supply.  As a result, movements in exchange rates can have a powerful effect on incentives to export and import, and thus on aggregate demand in the economy as a whole.

The policy rate, or benchmark interest rate, is the central bank's interest rate for short-term borrowings. It has become the primary monetary policy tool at several central banks. In Indonesia, the benchmark interest rate is the BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate. In the United States, it is the Fed Fund Rate (FFR).

It doesn't. Money supply has no influence on aggregate demand. Aggregate demand is effected by the buying power of money, real interest rate, and the real prices of imports and exports. If the supply of money rises it only causes a short term decrease in the nominal interest. The purchase price level is not along with a reduction in the
