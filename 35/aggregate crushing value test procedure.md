The %age wear due to rubbing with steel balls is determined and is known as abrasion value. Prepare the sample by the portion of an aggregate

## Crushing Value of Aggregate - Virtual Labs
Click on the cylinder to transfer the aggregate into 2.36mm sieve. Once the aggregate is added into sieves click on the set of sieves to place it in the mechanial shaker. Calculate the weight of aggregate retained on pan, click on NEXT button to proceed. Calculate the average aggregate crushing value, click on CHECK button to evaluate the answer.

## Aggregate Crushing Strength Test - Online CivilForum
The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.
