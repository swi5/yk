The key issue isn't a uniform "crushing" of the pipe, it's the stress concentration and potential for denting and buckling at the end of the concrete pier. in many cases, the concrete itself can't stand the edge load and breaks and spalls.  To consider laying a 24" pipe on a concrete "plinth" is nonsensical when considering the miniscule

## Concrete Crushing - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The desired concrete crushing failures shown in Figs. 1.24 and 1.25 can only be achieved if IC, CDC and PE debonding can be prevented from occurring before the design load to cause concrete crushing. However, this may not always be possible; in which case, it may be necessary to design for either IC or CDC debonding to occur at the design load so that concrete crushing will not occur.

## Concrete Pipe Crushing Analysis
Concrete pipe is a rigid pipe system that relies mostly on the strength of the pipe and is only slightly dependent on the strength derived from the soil envelope. The inherent strength of concrete pipe can compensate for site problems not designed for such as construction shortcomings and higher fill heights and trench depths. More Details
