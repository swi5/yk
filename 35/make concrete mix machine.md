## How to Make Concrete Blocks and Mix Concrete - EzineArticles
A recipe for a concrete mix is given as three numbers for example 1:3:4. This means one part Portland cement mixed with three parts sand and four parts gravel. Sometimes cinders or other light "aggregates" are used instead of gravel to make light weight blocks. You can mix the concrete by hand on a concrete floor or plywood sheet.

## How to Mix Concrete in a Mixer - HowToSpecialist
Start by pouring half a bucket of water (aprox. 5l) into the concrete mixer. You will determine the right amount of water with time, because the concrete should have the right consistency. If there is too much water the concrete will be too thin and thus unmanageable. If you use too few water, the concrete, sand and gravel won't mix properly.

## The Best Concrete Mix Ratio - Modern Design
The best all around concrete mix ratio for almost all residential work is 3500 psi. The concrete mix ratio to create 3500 psi concrete is 1:2.5:3. This means 1 part cement, 2 parts sand and 3 parts stone. Different strength concrete mixes have different ratios. I recommend using Portland cement but any brand cement will work.

## Concrete Mix Ratio: What Is It? What Is 1-2-3? .And More.
A concrete mix ratio is usually expressed by a set of numbers separated by colons, as is the case with a 1:2:3 ratio. This tells the mixer that they need to add 1 part cement powder, 2 parts sand, and 3 parts aggregate in order to create the desired concrete consistency. Water is not included in these ratios, though, because it can vary more

## 12 Types of Concrete Mixers Used in Home  - Home Stratosphere
Concrete mixers are machines that mix cement, aggregates, and water together to make the concrete paste or slurry. A good concrete mixture should not only uniformly mix the ingredients, but they should also discharge the mix without disturbing its uniformity. This can be judged by the uniform consistency and color of the slurry.

Mixing Concrete. The three main options for mixing concrete are: Mixing by hand - this is probably only suitable where less than about ¼m³ of concrete is required for a job providing that a reasonably fit person is available. Using a cement mixer - this is generally suitable where between about ¼m³ and 2m³ of concrete is required.

Step 3: Float the Concrete. Floating concrete is a critical step to achieve a smooth surface. While using a screed and darby gives you a roughly smooth surface, floating helps smooth out further imperfections, compact the concrete, and prepare for additional finishing steps. You can float concrete by hand or by using a machine.
