A device used to reduce the particle size of materials, bodies or glazes. A ball mill is simply a container that is filled with pebbles (either of porcelain or stones e.g. Flint) into which a charge (powder or slurry) is put and that is then mechanically rotated to cause the tumbling pebbles to crush particles that happen between them.

## Making black powder? - Cast Boolits
The formulae for black powder combustion usually assumes that it is a simple supply of oxygen to carbon and sulphur, yielding copious quantities of the carbon dioxide and nitrogen gases you want, plus the potassium sulphate and carbonate fouling which you don't. But this is not the case. You couldn't make effective powder with pure carbon.

## Black Powder - GardenBallistics
Making black powder is more complex than simply mixing the three ingredients together. This is in fact called green powder or polverone which burns slowly and inefficiently leaving lots of un-burnt solids behind. Proper black powder is mixed thoroughly to a fine powder using a ball mill or with other non-sparking grinding media.

## Ball mill | PyroData
A ball mill, a type of crusher, is a cylindrical device used to grind chemicals or mix compositions. Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium, ideally non sparking milling media like lead balls. An internal cascading effect reduces the material to a fine powder.
