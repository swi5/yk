## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
Leaching dissolves the gold out of the ore using a chemical solvent. The most common solvent is cyanide, which must be combined with oxygen in a process known as carbon-in-pulp. As the cyanide and oxygen react chemically, gold in the pulp dissolves. When workers introduce small carbon grains to the tank, the gold adheres to the carbon.

## gold processing - Mining and concentrating | Britannica
The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below). These heaps can be

1 Stamps. Stamps were used in California gold mines around 1850. First developed in England and used by Cornish miners, stamps were heavy iron machines used to pound rocks containing gold quartz into a fine dust so the gold ore could be extracted. Small stamps were commonly powered by water wheels while larger ones ran by steam engines.

The percolation cyanidation method is also one of the cyanide leaching processes. Its principle is that the cyanide solution penetrates through the ore layer to leach the gold from the gold-bearing ore. It is suitable for alluvial and loose porous materials. There are two kinds of percolation cyanidation methods: pool leaching and heap leaching.
