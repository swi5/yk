## Gyratory and Cone Crushers - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
A quick look at a machine will allow you to determine if it is a gyratory or a cone In simple terms, if you look at the top of the crusher and it has supporting arms ("spider arms") going out to the centre of the machine (normally 2 or 3) it's a gyratory.

## Difference between Cone & Gyratory Crusher
A gyratory crusher has a higher angle at the cone apex. This provides a longer residence time along the crushing interface and is supposed to generate a smaller & more consistent product. Metso Minerals have much more, probably much better, information on their website. 28th January 2009, 0:44 #3.

Cone Crushers More similar to gyratory crushers than jaw crushers. Cone crushers are even more conically-shaped, with a large top opening for loading the large materials and a much smaller-bottom opening for the much smaller, crushed materials to exit. Typically, cone crushers function by squeezing materials between an eccentrically gyrating

## How to distinguish between Cone Crusher and Gyratory Crusher?
Nov 24, 2021The two cones of the gyratory crusher are both steeply inclined, the moving cone is upright, and the fixed cone is an inverted truncated cone (mainly to meet the requirements of the feed size), and the material can be discharged vertically downwards by its own weight.

In the Gyratory all the movement is in the bottom of the crusher mantle. This is due to the angle that the main shaft is on. The greater angle of the cone crusher puts the pivot point below the distributor plate. While the pivot point for the gyratory crusher is at the spider cap. This difference in the pattern of gyration has a purpose.

## How does gyratory crusher work?s
How does a gyratory cone crusher work? Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h.

Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and developed by Gates around 1881 and were referred to as a Gates crusher [1]. The smaller form is described as a cone crusher. The larger crushers are normally known as primary crushers as they are designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines.
