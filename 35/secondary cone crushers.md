## A Detailed Overview of Cone Crushers and What You Need to Know
Cone crushers are typically looked at as a secondary or tertiary stage of crushing. But, they can also act as the first stage provided the material is small enough to fit through the feed opening. While these crushers are well adapted to a variety of materials, they don't perform well with moist or viscous materials, such as clay or shale.

## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel. Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point. As the wedge or eccentric rotates to cause the compression within the chamber, the

Secondary crushing, as you can imagine, is the second stage of material processing following its initial reduction. At this stage, material will flow through perhaps a second impactor or even a cone crusher, which is effective at breaking down these types of material.

A secondary cone crusher should be matched to a drive motor designed and specified for high load crushing duty. The motor specifications for top performing cone crushers are with a 1.15 Service Factor and a 200% breakdown torque. These specifications enable the crusher to operate for short periods of time at or above name plate motor power.

GUARANTEED FOR REAL LIFE. Typically applied in secondary and tertiary stages, the cone crusher produces reduction ratios of 6:1 to 4:1. Bushing cones, like Superior's Patriot Cone Crusher, consist of a rotating mantle inside a steel bowl. As rock is compressed between the mantle and the bowl, the force generated fractures the material.

## Secondary Impact Crushers » MTM Crushing and Screening
Explanation. Machines used to crush materials less than mm in size are called secondary crushers. The aim of the secondary stage is having material size reduced to 0-60,0-40 or 0-35 mm. Secondary jaw or cone crushers should be selected for hard and abrasive materials to maintain optimum operating costs.
