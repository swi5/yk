## General Methods of Metal Powder Production - Powder Metallurgy
Suitable methods for powder production depend on required production rates, powder properties, and the physical and chemical properties of the material. Chemical and electrolytic methods are useful for producing high-purity powders. Mechanical comminution (or milling) is the most widely used method of powder production for hard metals and oxides.
