Crushed old concrete is recycled as aggregates in highway pavements but it is not used in buildings and bridges because of uncertainties of performance of new concrete. If crushed old concrete can be recycled in new building construction it would help in getting rid of waste and preserve natural riverbed rocks.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

The reason for recycling is the reduction of waste in order to protect nature against pollution, the increasing shortage of suitable dumping grounds, and to save energy and natural resources. Concrete debris is typically reclaimed as recycled aggregate (RCA). By recycling concrete, valuable landfill space and natural resources are preserved.

## Sustainable Recycling of High-Strength Concrete as an Alternative to 
In the paper, the behavior of HPC with coarse recycled aggregate and natural coarse aggregate (NCA) was compared. Short-term experiments were conducted, including concrete deformation, deflection, load bearing capacity, and cracking of beams. The analysis involved reinforced concrete T-beams made in 100% of RCA or NCA.
