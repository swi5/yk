ZIMBABWE'S mining industry remains resilient in the short to medium term, despite the negative impact of Covid-19-induced setbacks on existing and planned investments. The country is targeting to grow export revenue from minerals to US$12 billion by 2023 as it seeks to transform the country into an upper-middle-income economy by 2030.

## The Mining Industry in Zimbabwe: Challenges for Sustainable Development 
Mining plays a key role in Zimbabwe's economy, contributing 5% and 23% to the country's gross domestic (GDP) and total exports, respectively. It also generates foreign currency and supplies raw materials to some industries. As a 'robber' industry, it extracts minerals from the earth without replacing them.
