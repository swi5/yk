## Bal-tec - Ball Weight and Density
The answer is calculated by multiplying the volume of the ball by the density of the material. Weight = Volume ⋅ Density For example, calculate the weight of a two inch diameter lead ball: Volume = 4 ⋅ π ⋅ R 3 3 π, a universal constant = 3.1416 4 ⋅ π = 12.566 R = Radius R = Diameter 2 = 2 2 = 1 R 3 = R ⋅ R ⋅ R = 1 12.566 ⋅ 1 = 12.566 12.566 3
