## process of calcium mining
Bentonite production process features ore mining, sodium activation - if required -, drying, and milling. Sodium activation is performed to convert calcium bentonite to sodium bentonite, in which calcium ions are exchanged for sodium carbonate. Through drying, bentonite natural moisture content of about 25-35% is reduced. Since bentonite is

The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

## method used to extract magnesium from its ore
An ore is usually a compound of the metal mixed with impurities. When the metal is dug up, a method must be used to separate the metal from the rest of the ore. This is called extracting the metal. The method of extraction depends on how reactive the metal is. The more reactive the metal, the more difficult it is to extract from its compound.
