## Some Problems in the Crushing and Grinding Stage of Mineral Processing
Selective grinding refers to a kind of grinding phenomenon in which the ore fragmentation degrees is different in the grinding process due to the difference in hardness between minerals. The main purpose of the crushing and grinding operation is not to reduce the ore particle size, but to dissociate the useful minerals from the gangue minerals.

## Mineral processing
Crushing and grinding are the two primary comminution processes. Crushing is normally carried out on "run-of-mine" ore, while grinding (normally carried out after crushing) may be conducted on dry or slurried material. In comminution, the size reduction of particles is done by three types of forces: compression, impact and attrition.
