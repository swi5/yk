## What are environmental regulations on mining activities?
The CERCLA, passed in 1980, enables the government to clean up any site where there is an unremedied release of a hazardous substance. Hazardous substances are broadly defined under CERCLA and have included mining, milling, and smelter wastes that are currently excluded from regulation under RCRA.
