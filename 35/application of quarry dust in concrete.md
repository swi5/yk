## application of quarry dust
The use of quarry dust for SCC applications . 01/04/2002· Granite fines are often referred to as quarry dust, a byproduct in the production of concrete aggregates during the crushing process of rocks For the materials supplied, the granite particles were finer than the limestone powder The shape of the granite fines tends to be flakier and more elongated than the limestone particles

The use of quarry dust for SCC applications ScienceDirect. In this respect, the utilisation of quarry dust could play a part in lowering the supply cost of SCC, which is currently some 80-150% higher than that of normal concrete In Sweden, the application of SCC is well established and according to Petersson [16], the cost of SCC is only 10

To over-come the difficulties due to excessive sand mining, quarry dust was used as fine aggregate. Quarry dust is the fine material, produced from gravel crushers. Super plasticizers were used to improve workability of concrete. Cement was replaced with 10% of silica fume. The M60 grade concrete used was designed by using a modified ACI method
