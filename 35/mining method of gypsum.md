## Gypsum | GeoKansas - University of Kansas
Gypsum outcrop in Clark County. Gypsum is an evaporite because it precipitates (settles) out of water as the water evaporates. the three varieties of gypsum are selenite, satin spar, and rock gypsum. Selenite, found throughout the Red Hills, has flat, diamond-shaped crystals that can be split into thin sheets.Satin spar is white or pink and fibrous with a silky luster.

Gypsum mining has a long history in Kansas, dating to the mid- to late-1800s. The first gypsum deposits worked in the state were near Blue Rapids in Marshall County. Both the Marshall County and Barber County plants have underground mines but the majority of gypsum in Barber County is produced from an open pit.

This method of gypsum mining produces approximately 90,000 to 160,000 tons of ore a year. The largest gypsum quarry in the world, Gold Bond's Milford, Nova Scotia operation, produces four and a half to five million tons of ore per year. The quarry process begins by first removing the earth over the deposit.

The nature of non-gypsum minerals was also investigated with XRPD (X-Ray Powder Diffraction) analyses.

Most of the world's gypsum is produced by surface-mining operations. In the United States, gypsum is mined in about 19 states. The states producing the most gypsum are Oklahoma, Iowa, Nevada, Texas, and California. Together, these states account for about two-thirds of the United States' annual production of gypsum.
