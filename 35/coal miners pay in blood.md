## Coal Miners - West Virginia
Between 1880 and 1920, southern West Virginia's population grew from 93,000 to 446,000, due almost entirely to the coal industry. The region's first coal miners primarily were African Americans, both enslaved and free. By 1850, approximately half of Kanawha County's slaves worked in the salt industry—many mined coal to fuel the furnaces.

Episode Notes. In 1969, Congress passed the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act to help miners who, as a result of their work, developed pneumoconiosis, an occupational sickness more commonly known as black lung disease.
