Compressive Strength Test on Bricks (Crushing strength) The ability of the brick to withstand a particular load without failure is the compressive strength of the brick. A compressive testing machine is the apparatus for determining the compressive strength. Crushing strength is 175kg/cm 2 (mean) where the minimum is 154 kg/cm 2.

## Plastic bricks advantages and disadvantagesa
Interlocking bricks are the enhanced form of conventional clay bricks.Each brick is constructively designed to lock itself to the other bricks around without the use of mortar. The self-locking is achieved using shear-key and lock mechanism. Based on the design, the shape of shear-key will vary and a complimentary lock is provided on the opposite side of brick.

## 「crushing strength of bricks」
The average crushing strength and tensile strength of hand moulded bricks are 60,000 kN/m 2 and 2000 kN/m 2 respectively. The shearing strength of bricks is about one tenth of the crushing strength. In practice, however, the bricks are not subjected to the tensile stresses.

## bricks crushing streanth machine
The minimum crushing strength of brick should be 105 kg/cm2. The crushing strength of brick can found out with the help of crushing testing machine. Brick is fixed to the crushing testing machine and then crushing force is applied to the brick during the testing operation. Compressive Strength = Maximum Load at Failure(N/mm 2) / Area of
