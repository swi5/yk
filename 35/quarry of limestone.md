Limestone though was the basic available stone. Easy to quarry and dress, it also bonds well with cement (limestone being its source). The limestone in question has been variously described over the years with many different nomenclatures, but the current consensus is that it is of the Mississippian Arroyo Penasco Group/La Pasada formation.

The Quarry is a Limestone quarry in The Great Desert, found just east of Fort Spencer, northwest of the Buried Library, and west of Puerto Dorado. Limestone can be mined from large deposits scattered around The Quarry. It is a good place to mine due to the fair selling price of Limestone and higher chance of getting Emeralds. Scaffolding and ramps can be seen throughout the quarry, with

It is noted that quarrying activities have adversely affected the forests, wild life sanctuaries, water courses and communities. The minerals that are quarried are primarily sedimentary in origin. Blue coloured limestone and sharp sand and gravel of various grades are quarried in the Northern Range for use in the construction industry.
