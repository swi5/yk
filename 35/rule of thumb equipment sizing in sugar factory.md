## Air Conditioner Sizing - GreenBuildingAdvisor
1. Using a rule of thumb like 400 to 600 square feet per ton will work for very few houses. Sizing an air conditioner to that metric will almost always result in an oversized air conditioner. Sometimes grossly oversized. 2. Actual cooling loads found by using the ACCA Manual J protocol are much lower than the rule of thumb numbers.

The "rule of thumb" to assure adequate nitrogen and phosphorus for BOD removal is to provide a maximum nutrient mass ratio of 100:5:1 (BOD:N:P). A higher ratio (e.g., 150:5:1) will reduce the rate of BOD removal and promote filamentous growth.

Genset Sizing Guidelines. Some conservative rules of thumb for genset sizing include: Oversize genset 20-25% for reserve capacity and for across the line motor starting. Oversize gensets for unbalanced loading or low power factor running loads. Use 1/2 hp per kW for motor loads.

Rule of Thumb HVAC Sizing. Frequently designers and contractors "guestimate" the size of HVAC units by figuring 1 Ton (12,000 Btuh) of air conditioning will cover 400 square feet (Sq-Ft) of building area. This ratio is vastly overused, and often leads to undersized HVAC units in our climate zone (the Sacramento Valley).

Smaller (<60,000 L) atmospheric tanks and pressure-rated vessels are often specified by generalist process and mechanical engineers.

## Rule of Thumb: Sizing for Storage Performance in the new world.
This rule of thumb is for Server workloads, not VDI. VDI Read/Write ratio is generally almost opposite to server, and around 30/70 Read/Write. However the SSD tier for VDI should be sized taking into account the benefits of VAAI/VCAI cloning and things like de duplication (for Memory and SSD tiers) which some products, like Nutanix offer.

## Design by rule of thumb - Structural engineering general discussion 
I have a very important rule of thumb to design a foundation for vibrating machines. i.e. Weight of footing = 3 to 5 times weight of the machine. romo (Civil/Environmental) 30 Oct 02 22:56. A few things for everyone: 1) Temporary repairs will soon be permanent. 2) If you have any doubts, check it again.

## Rule of thumb for panel sizing - Solar Panels Forum
200mA @ 12V is 2.4w x 24 hrs = 60 watts daily. (always round up) 5 days no sun = 300 watts consumed. An "average" 50ah AGM battery (not gel) holds 600wh of power, half of which is useable. So far, so good, low loads, low loss AGM battery. After 7 days, you will be really hurting the battery, but the sun comes out for at least 3 hours, 1 x a week.
