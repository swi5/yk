## Sand mining
Sand mining is the extraction of sand, mainly through an open pit (or sand pit) but sometimes mined from beaches and inland dunes or dredged from ocean and river beds. Sand is often used in manufacturing, for example as an abrasive or in concrete.It is also used on icy and snowy roads usually mixed with salt, to lower the melting point temperature, on the road surface.

Irresponsible sand mining is also a huge threat to the river banks, bridges, and nearby structures. It also affects the contiguous groundwater system and the usages that local residents make of the river. Sand mining can be responsible for the destruction of riparian and aquatic habitat through huge changes in the channel morphology.

## A sustainable solution to excessive river sand mining by utilizing by 
The sand in a river's bed preserves its environmental equilibrium (Farahani and Bayazidi, 2018). Excessive river-sand mining for use as fine aggregate in concrete is responsible for riverbed degradation, which causes a wide range of problems, including the loss of water-holding soil strata and the slippage of riverbanks (Sankh et al., 2014
