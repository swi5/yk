## Aggregation in DBMS | Comprehensive Guide to Aggregation in DBMS - EDUCBA
Aggregation in DBMS (Database Management System) is a process of combining two or more entities to form a more meaningful new entity. This Aggregation process is done when the entities don't make sense on their own without applying the aggregation process. In order to create aggregation between two entities, which cannot be used for its

## How to Use Aggregation to Compute the Sum of a Field in Elasticsearch 
We give that aggregation a name quantity_sum . We set the aggregation type to sum so Elasticsearch knows what calculation to compute. Then we specify the field that we want to take an average on field: "quantity". You can run this application using NodeJS with this command: 1. $ node sum. js. Let's see if it works.

## Aggregation in the analytic hierarchy process: Why weighted geometric 
The main focus of this paper is the aggregation of local priorities into global priorities in the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. We study two most frequently used aggregation approaches - the weighted arithmetic and weighted geometric means - and identify their strengths and weaknesses.  We investigate the focus of the aggregation
