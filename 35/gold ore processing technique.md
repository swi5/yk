Gold can be freed from these ores or concentrates by treating them with various oxidizing processes. The most common method is to roast gold-bearing minerals at temperatures of 450° to 750° C (840° to 1,380° F) to destroy the interfering sulfides.

## Processes of gold ore separation,the process of gold extraction,gold 
Oct 26, 2020The three most commonly used processes for gold ore separation are: gravity separation, flotation and cyanidation. Among them, gravity separation is a commonly used process in placer gold mines, flotation is mostly used in rock gold mines, and cyanidation is suitable for refractory gold ores such as oxide ore and flotation concentrate.

In addition to creating a more permeable heap, agglomeration offers another advantage: a jump start to the leaching process. By incorporating the leaching agent into the agglomeration stage, the ore fines and leaching agent are homogeneously mixed.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified.

By 2000 bc the process of purifying gold-silver alloys with salt to remove the silver was developed. The mining of alluvial deposits and, later, lode or vein deposits required crushing prior to gold extraction, and this consumed immense amounts of manpower. By ad 100, up to 40,000 slaves were employed in gold mining in Spain.
