## Quartz Applications & Uses In Different Industries
1) Jewelry and gemstones. For centuries, quartz has been used in jewelry production and as gemstones. The hard, polishable, crystalline and durable nature of quartz make it an excellent material for this purpose. The varieties of quartz popularly used as jewelry and gemstones include Citrine, Amethyst, Ametrine, rose quartz, Aventurine, and Opal.

crystalline silica, although silicosis and other lung diseases are also a concern where control measures are poor. The minerals quartz, cristobalite and tridymite are crystalline forms of silicon dioxide that are found naturally around the world. Quartz is in most rocks, but most particularly in sandstone and granite - quartz is just yellow sand.
