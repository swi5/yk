Halite forms when sea or salt water evaporates. When the water evaporates, 3 minerals are formed. First calcite forms out of the solution then gypsum. After both of those minerals are formed, halite is. Is halite formed from a solution? Minerals form when solutions evaporate For example, deposits of the mineral halite, or table salt, formed

## Gypsum - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Gypsum (CaSO4 · 2H2O), the most common of the sulphate minerals, is also known as alabaster (a fine-grained massive form), satin spar (a fibrous variety of gypsum), or selenite (colourless transparent gypsum crystals). Gypsum is often found in considerable thicknesses within evaporite sequences and in association with limestones and shales.

The process of lithification to form sedimentary rocks: Deposition is the settling of clasts, compaction is the movement of clasts closer together, and cementation is the bonding of the clasts together.  Rock gypsum is softer than both calcite and halite, and therefore more susceptible to physical weathering. Rock gypsum has been

Elements that Form Gypsum. Gypsum. See More Photos. Gypsum is made up of oxygen, sulfur, calcium and water. As evaporation occurs the sulfur is not protected by the water and oxygen contacts sulfur bonding with it to form a sulfate (SO4 2). The sulfate then bonds with calcium (Ca) and water (H2O) to create gypsum.

Gypsum. Gypsum is a mineral found in crystal as well as masses called gypsum rock. It is a very soft mineral and it can form very pretty, and sometimes extremely large colored crystals. Massive gypsum rock forms within layers of sedimentary rock, typically found in thick beds or layers.

## What Is The Most Common Chemical Sedimentary Rock?
Others include chert banded iron formation and a variety of rocks that form when bodies of water evaporate. Biological processes are important in the formation of some chemical sedimentary rocks especially limestone and chert.  Common evaporites are halite (rock salt) gypsum borates potassium salts and magnesium salts. What is the most

## gypsum | Definition, Uses, & Facts | Britannica
Gypsum occurs in extensive beds associated with other evaporite minerals (e.g., anhydrite and halite), particularly in Permian and Triassic sedimentary formations; it is deposited from ocean brine, followed by anhydrite and halite.It also occurs in considerable quantity in saline lakes and salt pans and is an important constituent of cap rock, an anhydrite-gypsum rock forming a covering on

Gypsum, common sulfate mineral of superb industrial significance, composed of hydrated calcium sulfate (CaSO4 ·2H2O). In properly-developed crystals the mineral normally has been called selenite. The fibrous large variety has a silky lustre and is known as satin spar; it is translucent and opalescent and is valued for ornaments and jewellery.
