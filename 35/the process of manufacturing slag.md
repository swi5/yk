## What is Process Manufacturing? Definition and Examples - BatchMaster
Process manufacturing is a type of production method that produces finished goods by combining ingredients or raw materials using a specific formula or recipe, and under specific conditions of heat, and pressure. As a result, the process leads to thermal or chemical conversions. Therefore, a product manufactured through this process cannot be disassembled into its ingredients or raw materials.

Slag is a by-product of the metallurgical smelting process. Slag has a double role: it permits removal of impurities, known as gangue, from the melt by forming oxides. It also allows exchange reactions with the liquid metal, permitting control of the process in order for the desirable elements to stay in the melt while the others are removed.

May 11, 2022Manufacturing is the production of a product by processing raw materials. This is accomplished through human labor, the use of machinery and/or other tools and often a biological or chemical process. Manufacturing can be on a large scale, or it can make the pieces that are assembled to build automobiles, airplanes, household appliances and more.

## calcium chloride manufacturing process from waste slag
Nov 30, 2020 · High-purity intermetallic β-Ti (FeTi4) and FeTi alloys were prepared via molten salt electrolysis from a titanium-containing waste slag and Fe2O3 mixture using molten CaCl2 salt as the electrolyte. The mixed slag powders were pressed into a pellet that served as a cathode, while a graphite rod served as an anode.

## The Steel Manufacturing Process - How is Steel Made?
To purify the steel, the furnace then blasts in oxygen, and lime and fluorspar are added. These substances combine with the steel's impurities, turning into slag. The slag then floats to the top of the molten steel where it is removed, leaving behind the pure steel. The EAF method is the most common steel production method today.
