Answer (1 of 4): A soil is a complex three phase system - comprising of soil solids, water and air. Bulk density (aka total density) is the total mass of the soil (ie mass of soil solids, water and air) per unit volume, while a dry density is mass of soil solids only per unit volume of the soil.

Now by slightly re-arranging the above equation we can separate (M/V) as the bulk density of soil sample. So, Ddry (dry density of soil) = (Ms /M ) x (M / V) Now, we know the mass of soil sample is the mass of soil solids and the mass of water in the voids. With such, M = Ms + Mw Now; Ddry (dry density of soil) = (Ms / (Ms+Mw) ) x (M / V)

## Bulk Density - Measurement | Fact Sheets | soilquality.au
Bulk density is the weight of soil in a given volume. Soils with a bulk density higher than 1.6 g/cm3 tend to restrict root growth. Bulk density increases with compaction and tends to increase with depth. Sandy soils are more prone to high bulk density. Bulk density can be used to calculate soil properties per unit area (e.g. kg/ha).
