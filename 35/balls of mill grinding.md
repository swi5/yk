## Grinding balls, buy metal balls from Metinvest manufacturer
A ball mill is a drum-grinding unit where balls from solid materials (steel, iron, hard alloys, ceramics, etc) are used. Most common are ball mills, where when the drum rotates and the balls rub against the inner walls, the balls are lifted until the lifting angle becomes bigger than the angle of repose. Then the grinding media are again below.

## Grinding Balls & Rods - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Grinding Balls. Steel balls ranging from ¾ to 5 in. in diameter are used. Rods range from 1½ to 4 in. in diameter and should be 3 to 4 in. shorter than the inside mill length. Tube mills are usually fed balls smaller than 2 in., whereas 4- or 5-in. balls are more commonly used for ball-mill grinding.
