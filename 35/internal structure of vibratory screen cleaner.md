## Vibroset Vibrating Screener - SMICO Vibratory Screens
THE VIBROSET VIBRATING SHAKER MAKES A GREAT SCALPING SCREEN! Here's how the Vibroset works: This vibratory shaker is a two bearing screen with a centroidally mounted drive. It features a positive eccentric action for smoother operation, meaning less vibration transmission. The Vibroset vibrating separator also utilizes sealed-for-life bearings.

Sliders work by four different methods, depending on the material properties: 1. Vertical separator motion impacts the slider ring on the bottom of the mesh, dislodging trapped near-size particles from the screen-mesh openings. This process effectively cleans the screen and opens the mesh for the next particle to be screened.
