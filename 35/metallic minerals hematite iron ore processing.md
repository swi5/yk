## Iron Ore Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.

You will be able to detect their alloys using a metal detector only if they contain iron content or have magnetic properties. For instance, Cobalt or nickel alloys will set off your metal detector even if they contain no iron content. Non-ferrous metals without magnetic properties such as aluminum, zinc, and their alloys are also detectable.

Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

Iron metal can be refined from the mineral hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). One way of converting the mineral to iron is to react it with carbon monoxide, as shown below: Because the hematite is obtained from various ores, it is usually not in a pure form. Suppose an iron manufacturer has 2.00 × 10 5 kg of ore available, and the ore is 93% Fe 2 O 3 by mass.

An ore is a mineral deposit that contains a metal that can be extracted using existing technological methods. Iron can be extracted from two types of iron ores: Magnetite and hematite. Magnetite is composed of iron in the form of Fe 3 O 4. Hematite is a mineral that contains iron in the form of Fe 2 O 3.

## Iron ore Processing Plant
Iron ore Processing Plant. At present, there are about 300 kinds of iron-bearing minerals found in nature. According to the classification of chemical composition, the common iron ore mainly includes magnetite, hematite, limonite and siderite. Different properties of iron ore, its processing technology is naturally different.

## Hematite
Hematite (/ ˈ h iː m ə ˌ t aɪ t, ˈ h ɛ m ə-/), also spelled as haematite, is a common iron oxide compound with the formula, Fe 2 O 3 and is widely found in rocks and soils. Hematite crystals belong to the rhombohedral lattice system which is designated the alpha polymorph of Fe 2 O 3.It has the same crystal structure as corundum (Al 2 O 3) and ilmenite (FeTiO 3).With this it forms a
