## Minerals | Free Full-Text | Understanding the Entrainment Behavior of 
Flotation is one of the most used methods to upgrade natural graphite resources. However, the efficiency is usually decreased due to the entrainment of undesirable fine gangue minerals. In this work, the impact of different factors such as particle size, pulp density, and flotation reagent on the entrainment of mica and quartz in a flake graphite flotation was studied.

The graphite is distributed in the form of very small particles emulsified in water and distributed in both phases (aqueous and organic), making the treatment process very difficult. In general, treatment of an effluent of this type requires a preliminary step to breaks the emulsion so that the graphite dispersed in the liquid medium can be

## Graphite flotation
Graphite flotation. Graphite diffusing from cast iron melts rising to the top of the melt. In metallographic specimen floating graphite is very clearly identifiable even with low degree of magnification. At broken or machined surfaces, the diffused and floated spherolites can be identified as dark spots even with the unaided eye ( Figures 1 to 3 ).

The separation of graphite from various gangue minerals (e.g., feldspar, kaolin, quartz, mica, carbonates) has been investigated through flotation [ 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 ]. Actually, graphite is one of the minerals easiest to float with non-ionic collectors due to its natural hydrophobic properties.

## Technical Report: The occurrence of graphite flotation in a ductile 
Graphite flotation was observed to occur to an extent that depends on the carbon equivalent (C.E.) and casting modulus. In the present casting, graphite flotation occurred when the C.E. exceeded 4.42. Graphite particle clustering and graphite morphology degeneration into exploded nodules and compacted flake form was observed in the flotation zone.

## Graphite ore flotation processing flow chart
The flotation of graphite ore is generally carried out by positive flotation followed by reverse flotation of the flotation concentrate. A higher grade graphite concentrate can be obtained by flotation. Flotation graphite concentrate grades can usually reach 80% to 90%, using multi-stage grinding; the purity can reach 98%.
