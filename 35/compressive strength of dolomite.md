## Compressive Strength of Concrete | Cube Test, Procedure, Apparatus 
The Compressive strength of specimen can be calculated by dividing maximum load carried by the specimen by cross-sectional area of the specimen cubes. The surface area of specimen: = 150 x 150 = 22500mm² = 225cm². Assume, The Max compression load is 450KN. 1KN = 1000N ; 450Kn = 450×100 = 450000N.

## What is Compressive Strength?- Definition, Formula
Compressive strength is a limited state of compressive stress that leads to failure in a material in the manner of ductile failure (infinite theoretical yield) or brittle failure (rupture as the result of crack propagation, or sliding along a weak plane). Compressive strength is measured on materials, components, and structures.

The compressive strength of concrete is defined as the resistance to failure under the decided force. It is the maximum load applied at any cross-sectional area. You can calculate the compressive strength of concrete by the formula, F = P / A. Where, F is the compressive strength. P is the maximum load applied in Newton.

## compressive strength of dolomite
In addition, the compressive strength of the concrete made with dolomite is higher than concrete with crushed light bricks by about 51, 535, and 52 at 7, 28 and 90 days, respectively because of the high voids ratio and high water of light brick comparing to dolomite which affects negatively on compressive strength

## Whats the meaning of compressive strength? Explained by FAQ Blog
Compressive strength resists compression, whereas tensile strength resists tension. Reliability in psychological test construction/ Types or methods of reliability.  Low porosity dolomite and quartzite can have unconfined compressive strengths up to 300 MPa. (6) uniaxial tensile strengths are usually 10 to 20 times lower than unconfined
