1. Fill the container with small metal balls. Most people prefer to use steel balls, but lead balls and even marbles can be used for your grinding. Use balls with a diameter between ½" (13 mm) and ¾" (19 mm) inside the mill. The number of balls is going to be dependent on the exact size of your drum.

## How Does Short Path Distillation Work? | Across International
Also known as fractional distillation, short path distillation is a process that separates and purifies materials from other compounds based on volatility differences through low-pressure evaporation. It uses a vacuum pump to lower atmospheric pressure, which lowers the boiling points of the compounds inside the distillation system.
