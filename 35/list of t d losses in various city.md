## Electricity: How to Correctly Report Emissions - Ecometrica
This mistake can lead to unfair comparisons between reporting companies' scope 2 emissions (if one company is reporting correctly and another company is not). T&D loss emissions can be up to 25% of generated emissions, and so including T&D loss emissions in scope 2 can skew the figures significantly.

## Endeavouring to taper T&D losses - Electrical & Power Review
At all-India level, energy loss in T&D for FY16 was estimated at about 240 billion units. The government is putting-in effort to control these losses through various initiatives under schemes such as Smart Grid Mission/EESL's Smart Meter program and UDAY. However, the pace of progress of these reforms needs a thrust.

The following guidelines for T&D emission losses should be followed to help avoid double counting. Note that published electricity grid emission factors do not generally include T&D losses. For a company that purchases its electricity from a T&D system, but does not own any part of the system, T&D losses should not be included in a Scope 2
