## Assaying Tin Ore - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The method adopted for the determination of tin in the ore is as follows:—About 2½ ounces troy (1200 grains, or about 80 grams) of the ore to be assayed is weighed out and mixed on a flat copper pan (shaped with a long lip) with one-fifth of its weight (240 grains, or 15.5 grams) of powdered culm (anthracite).

The frothed ore collects on the oil section whereas the impurities settle down in the water medium. Chemical Separation: One way of concentrating the ore is by chemical separation. For example, the separation of aluminium (Al) from the bauxite ore. This process of separating aluminium from the bauxite ore is also termed Bayer's Process.

A few methods for extracting ore are: heap leaching: the addition of chemicals such as cyanide or acid to remove ore. flotation: the addition of a compound that attaches to the valuable mineral and floats. smelting: roasting rock causing it to segregate into layers so the mineral can be extracted.

Desliming is the key part of the tin gravity separation process, which directly affects the separating effect. In China, more than 80% of the raw tin ore is placer tin deposit. The desliming process is actually divided into two stages, one is dissociation and dispersion of the slime, and the other is the separation of mud and sand.
