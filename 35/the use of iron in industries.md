In each of them, iron is combined with other elements which include carbon, chromium, nickel, silicon, molybdenum, and so on. Therefore, it can be said that the most important use of iron ore is in the manufacture of steel which has a wide range of use in industries. There are hardly any industries which do not use steel in any form.

## What is iron and what is it used for?
Why do we use iron and steel? Iron and steel. Pure iron is soft and easily shaped because its atoms are arranged in a regular way that lets layers of atoms slide over each other. Pure iron is too soft for many uses. It is hard, but too brittle for most uses, so most iron from the blast furnace is converted into steel by removing some of the carbon.

1825 has been called the start of the new Iron Age, as the iron industry experienced a massive stimulation from the heavy demand for railways, which needed iron rails, iron in the stock, bridges, tunnels and more. Meanwhile, civilian use increased, as everything which could be made of iron began to be in demand, even window frames.

## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics - ThoughtCo
History . Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore, leaving behind a soft, malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.
