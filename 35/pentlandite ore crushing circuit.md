B. Mishra, in Encyclopedia of Materials: Science and Technology, 2001 1 Sources and Commercial Methods. The extractable sulfide minerals are pentlandite ((Ni,Fe) 9 S 8) which contains a small amount of cobalt, and the most abundant pyrrhotite ((Fe n−1 S n) or (Ni,Fe) 7 S 8).Chalcopyrite is another major mineral for nickel sulfide ores that must be considered when choosing extractive processes.

## Pentlandite: The mineral pentlandite information and pictures
Pentlandite is both an individual mineral, and the name of a mineral group. The Pentlandite group is composed of rare sulfides that have similar chemical structures, with Pentlandite being the most prominent member of the group. Pentlandite is named in honor of Joseph Barclay Pentland (), a natural scientist from Ireland who first identified this mineral.

This circuit is employed where either the tonnage or the work index of the ore is high enough to require that the crushing be done in stages. Again the ore will come from a Primary crusher and be scalped. The coarse material will be crushed by the secondary crusher. The fines will be taken out of the circuit.

The fraction of nickel in pentlandite (nickel ore) is only 5.5 × 10 −3 g Ni/g ore. To supply 1 g of pure nickel to an industrial process requires that at least 181 g of pentlandite be dug. If the nickel mine is underground, the upper layers of topsoil and clay are also excavated, perhaps a forest is also cut and biotic material degraded.
