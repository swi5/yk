## Concrete Production, Placement, & Curing Process || Summary
Curing of concrete is defined as a process to maintain temperature and moisture of concrete during the hydration process of cement due to that hydration of cement completed and concrete gains maximum strength. Curing of concrete done by various methods that are given below. Water curing. Membrane curing. Steam curing.

## Process of Manufacture of Concrete | Steps involved in Concreting
The concrete quality depends on the manufacturing process of concrete. The manufacturing process involves the following steps :- Batching or measurement of materials, Mixing, Transportation, Placing, Compacting, Curing. Batching of Material: To maintain the standard of concrete, the quantities of the materials should be perfect.

Concrete production is the process of mixing together the various ingredients—water, aggregate, cement, and any additives—to produce concrete. Concrete production is time-sensitive. Once the ingredients are mixed, workers must put the concrete in place before it hardens. In modern usage, most concrete production takes place in a large type

Introduction. Staircase is an important component of a building providing access to different floors and roof of the building. It consists of a flight of steps and one or more intermediate landing slabs between the floor levels. Stairs can be defined as series of steps suitably arranged for the purpose of connecting different floors of a building.

Precast steps can cost between $200 to $1000. The price of precast steps depends on the material and riser. You may have to pay more for three riser precast steps. There will be a huge price difference between one riser precast step and three riser precast steps. It is estimated that you may have to pay $2000 to replace concrete steps.
