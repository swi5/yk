The mines produced a fortune in the next few years but were closed again in 1891. Opened again in 1906, ore production lasted until 1940. Closed again, Cable became a ghost town again, this time probably for good or at least until the price of gold increases. The property is closed to visitors due to vandalism.

## When to use electrowinning? Explained by FAQ Blog
What is electrowinning process? Electrowinning (or electroextraction) is a process of whereby metals, such as gold, silver and copper,are recovered from a solution by means of electrolytic chemical reaction.  The metal is deposited in a form that can be readily smelted easily into a more usable form.

The Electrowinning Process: Part One. The electrowinning process is a relatively traditional method to recover waste metals through the rinse system and at the same time reduce waste water generation and chemical discharge. The most common metals recovered using electrowinning are gold, silver, copper, cadmium and zinc due to their relative value.

## In electrorefining the impure metal is made?
Electrowinning is one of the oldest electrolytic processes known and was first introduced in 1807 by English chemist Humphry Davy. Where does pure metal gets deposited after passing current? When an electric current is passed, pure metal gets deposited at the cathode and the impure metal gets dissolved from the anode. Impurities from the metal

## When is electrorefining used?f
What is the difference between electrowinning and electrorefining? Electrowinning is defined as the process in which the metals from their ores are put in the solution that is they are electrodeposited to liquefy the metals. Whereas in electrorefining, it is defined as the process in which the impurities from the metal are removed.

The future of silver. Recovery of silver and silver recycling is accomplished using various methods, including the Parkes process, cupellation, parting, slag fuming, and electrolysis (electrorefining and electrowinning).

Increasing the active surface area by using mercury-coated copper wool resulted in up to 96 pct of the mercury being electrowon from mill carbon strip solutions that contained 1.9 to 20 ppm Hg, 20 to 345 ppm Au, and 0.35 to 39.5 ppm Ag. About 98 pct of the silver was electrowon with the mercury onto the mercury cathode.

## The Electrowinning Process: Part One :: Total Materia Article
The Electrowinning Process: Part One. The electrowinning process is a relatively traditional method to recover waste metals through the rinse system and at the same time reduce waste water generation and chemical discharge. The most common metals recovered using electrowinning are gold, silver, copper, cadmium and zinc due to their relative value.

## The fluidized bed electrowinning of silver | SpringerLink
Fluidized bed electrowinning appears to be an alternative to the Zadra cell usually employed to deposit silver electrolytically from cyanide solutions. By using a bench scale cell it was found that when using either pure silver or silver coated copper particles such electrowinning could be carried out without operating problems and with reasonable current efficiency and cell voltage. Various

## Pilot Plant Copper Electrowinning
The electrowinning of copper is an electrolytic process that uses electricity to recover dissolved copper from solution as copper plate, also known as 'cathode' Cu 2+(aq) + 2e >Cu (s) (E 0 = +034V) Copper easily dissolves in acids including sulphuric, nitric and hydrochloric Recovering copper cathode from acidic sulphate
