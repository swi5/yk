## Calcium carbonate, characteristics, properties and production, chemical 
Chemical reactions of calcium carbonate: Calcium carbonate is the average salt formed by strong base (calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2) and weak acid (carbonic acid H2CO3). Aqueous solutions of CaCO3 have a weak alkaline reaction. Chemical properties of potassium hydroxide are similar to the properties of the carbonates of other metals.

A lot of people take calcium carbonate for heartburn. But, what happens is the calcium carbonate actually dries up the acid in the stomach over time to the point where you have less and less acid. So not only is the calcium not being absorbed well or is benefiting you in any way, but it also ends up causing heartburn.

## New cancer weapon: nanoparticle made from calcium carbonate in antacid 
In water, the pH in calcium carbonate increases as high as 9. But when injected into the body, the team discovered that calcium carbonate only raises the pH to 7.4, the normal pH in the human body. However, working with calcium carbonate presented some challenges. "Calcium carbonate doesn't like to be small," Som said.
