## Isothermal Hydrogen Reduction of a Lime-Added Bauxite Residue 
The reduction of iron with hydrogen has been observed in recent studies [18,19,20]. In bauxite, iron is mainly found in the oxide form called hematite (Fe 2 O 3), while lower quantity of goethite, FeOOH, may co-exist. Throughout the reduction of the iron oxide with hydrogen, it will form magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) before further reduction to metallic

## The preparation of magnetite, goethite, hematite and maghemite of 
Mill scale iron waste has been used to prepare some iron oxide pigments via specific precursors. Magnetite and goethite were precipitated from their respective precursors in aqueous media. Various red shades of hematite were prepared by the calcinations of the precipitated goethite at temperatures ranging from 600 to 900 °C. Maghemite was obtained by thermal treatment of magnetite at 200 °C

Iron lathe waste powder has the potential as a raw material in the synthesis of hematite pigments. Hematite pigments have many advantages, one of which is anti-swelling properties that can maintain the dimensions of wood. Hematite pigment synthesis was carried out using the precipitation-sonication method. The precipitation stage uses an ammonium hydroxide solution as a precipitating agent
