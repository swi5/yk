## Quartz Glass - QSI Quartz
Quartz is the only stable polymorph of crystalline silica on the Earth's surface. It is found in all forms of rocks: igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. It becomes concentrated in soils, bodies of water and sand when a quartz-bearing rock is weathered or eroded. "The chemical formula of quartz is SiO2.

## The Nature of Quartz | Henderson State University
Quartz forms in several rock types. Veins that run through sandstone often produce clear crystals, and veins in shale more often produce a variety called milky quartz. The milky appearance is due to numerous tiny spaces which refract light. (Common quartz crystal, left; smoky quartz crystal, right) Without impurities, crystals may be "crystal

Side Note: Naturally occurring Green Quartz is becoming increasingly rare, so many stones that are being sold as Green Quartz are actually just piece of Amethyst that have been treated. Green Quartz used to be found in many parts of the world in places such as India, Russia, China and Australia. However, since the 1950's, Green Quartz has been mostly mined in a small section of Brazil.

Quartz and rock crystal, geology. Quartz is actually the name for a group of minerals, a large and important group. Many of the well-known minerals such as rock crystal, amethyst and agate belong to this group. The origin of the quartz name is unclear. It is probably from Saxon, but there are also references to an older Slavic origin.

## Here Is The Correct Way To Effectively Recognize Gold Ore
Ore, a naturally occurring rock or sediment with enough minerals, must be considered economically important enough to extricate. Ores can be either metals or gems. Ores are taken out of the earth in the process of mining and refined or smelted to remove the valuable materials. Gold is a type of valuable metal that can be extracted from ore.

Quartz is one of the dominant minerals in muddy sediments, and it can have a number of silica origins and forms. The current literature shows that there are three distinct genetic or primary silica sources of silica in marine sedimentary rocks (): (1) terrigenous silica, which originates mainly from influx by rivers, and to a lesser extent by eolian transport; (2) biogenic silica, mainly
