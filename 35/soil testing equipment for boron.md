The AB-DTPA extractant has proven effective for determining boron and other nutrients on alkaline soils. It has been shown that this soil test alone was not as effective as the hot-water extractant in assessing boron availability to alfalfa (167). This soil test required the inclusion of percentage clay, organic matter, and soil pH to be effective.
