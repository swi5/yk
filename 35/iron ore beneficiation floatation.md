The flotation method of concentration, used extensively for other metal ores, has only recently been utilized for hematite iron ores. It can be applied as either the sole concentration process or as a final concentration stage to ensure a high-grade product. In the flotation process, air is bubbled through a suspension of fine iron ore in water

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) showed that an increasing PAM or PDADMAC concentration reduced the iron flotation recovery. However there was very little reduction in iron grade. When the concentration increased from 0 mg/L to 3 mg/L for PAM and 0 mg/L to 30 mg/L for PDADMAC, the recoveries of iron decreased from 74.66% to 66.74% and 74.66% to 64.63%, respectively.

## Iron Ore Beneficiation Plant Flotation Iron Ore Separation
Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore and magnetite as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purification. Hematite however responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite so it is the preferred type of ore.
