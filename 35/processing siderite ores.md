## Iron ore Processing Plant
Iron ore Processing Plant. At present, there are about 300 kinds of iron-bearing minerals found in nature. According to the classification of chemical composition, the common iron ore mainly includes magnetite, hematite, limonite and siderite. Different properties of iron ore, its processing technology is naturally different.

## What is ore handling?tankandlift
What is the purpose of processing ore? Mineral processing, art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock, or gangue. It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.

Due to the depletion of high-quality iron ore, it is becoming ever more urgent to involve the ores which, for some reason or other, could not be used in metallurgy, or were used in limited quantities. For example, the siderite ores of Bakalsk deposit (Chelyabinsk region, Russia, stocks of more than 1 billion tons) are of very limited use in the blast-furnace practice because of the relatively

## 4 Siderite Ore Extraction Method - Mining-pedia
Mar 31, 2022Moreover, siderite is weakly magnetic iron ore, most of the siderites are fine-grained and complex in composition, and belong to refractory iron ore resources. After the accumulation of production practice, there are 4 Siderite ore extraction methods: Gravity separation. Strong magnetic separation. Strong magnetic separation - flotation.

2.2. Procedure of Experiment. The test flow sheet of excessive coal-based direct reduction process to coproduce DRI powder and semi-coke is presented in Fig. 2.Firstly, siderite lump ore was charged into a rotary kiln (bench scale: ϕ120×200 mm, pilot scale: ϕ1000×500 mm) for reduction.The amount of coal required for reduction was determined by designed C/Fe mass ratio and the
