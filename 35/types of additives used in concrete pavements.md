## Basic Introduction of concrete as a construction Material
Concrete proves to be a very good binding material. Its strength can be increased by adding the proper ratio of admixtures. 28 days are the best curing time for the concrete where it gives the optimum strength i-e 100%. Its variability in types depending upon its use in the construction makes it versatile and usable.

Introduction to previous concrete: Previous concrete allows 50% infiltration while impermeable concrete allows only 15% and it has lighter densities of 15M to 1900 kg / m3. Before placing the concrete, treatment begins on the rear concrete slab and pavement, the subgrade must be dampened to prevent water from being absorbed by the concrete.

Round-shaped steel fibers are the most common type used in fiber-reinforced concrete. Steel fiber in concrete is often used for road pavement overlays, bridge decks, and airfield pavement. Glass fibers in concrete can be used for more modern and aesthetically pleasing, lower-weight structures, like furniture or architectural claddings on buildings.

Dusting. Dusting is another type of concrete failure that is caused by a weakened concrete surface. This is typically the result of either bleed water that is worked back into the concrete or inadequate curing. When bleed water remains for longer periods of time, such as in colder climates, dusting can be a common issue.
