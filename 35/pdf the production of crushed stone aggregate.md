## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
Crushed stone: The term "crushed stone" usually refers to stone that has a mixture of stone dust in it. This type of stone is best used for a base when heavy compaction is needed. As a result, it is typically used for the base of concrete and paving projects, foundations of structures, and driveway bases.
