Magnetic separation is the process of using magnetic force to remove metallic or ferrous materials from a mixture. Magnetic separation machines consist of a vibratory feeding mechanism, an upper and lower belt and a magnet. The bulk material is fed through the vibrating mechanism onto the lower belt. At this point, the magnet pulls any material.

## Magnetic Separator, mining machine supplier - walker mining
For mining industry, the magnetic separator is suitable for wet or dry magnetic separation of manganese ore, magnetite, pyrrhotite, roasted ore, ilmenite, hematite limonite and other materials with particle size less than 2-3mm. It is also used for iron removal of coal, non-metallic ore, building materials and other materials.

## Magnetic separation for the mining industry--China NingBo Souwest 
In recent years, in order to satisfy the ever changing needs and requirements of the mining industry; new and improved magnetic separators had to be developed. Depending on the type of mineral being mined, the size of tramp irons occurring will vary. Hence, magnetic separators require varying degrees of magnetic flux power.
