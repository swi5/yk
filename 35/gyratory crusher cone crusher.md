## Gyratory Crusher l Introduce, Working Principle - JXSC Mine
Gyratory Crusher VS Cone Crusher. 1. The two cone shapes of the gyratory crusher are steeply inclined. The movable cone is upright, and the fixed cone is an inverted truncated cone which in order to increase the need for feeding ore. Nevertheless, cone crusher has two cone shapes, which are gently inclined, vertical frustum cone. There is a

Finally, based on the iron ore coarsely crushed by the gyratory crusher, the dynamic characteristics of the C900 cone crusher were simulated by using the discrete element method (DEM), and the simulation results are basically consistent with the numerical analysis results. Results show that considering the amount of ore uplift in the blockage

## How does gyratory crusher work?s
How does a gyratory cone crusher work? Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h.

A primary gyratory crusher was required to crush iron ore at the rate of 3000 t/h. The largest size of the run-of-mine ore was 1000 mm. The required product size was less than 162 mm. Manufacturer's data indicated that the nearest size of gyratory crusher would be 1370 mm × 1880 mm with a cone angle of 18°.

Cone Crushers; Typically, the initial crushing stage is completed using either gyratory crushers or jaw crushers. It is often the case that there will be only one crusher installed, and this will be referred to as the primary crusher. Cone crushers are more often used for 2nd, 3rd & 4th stage crushing steps (although not always).
