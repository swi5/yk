## Manufacturing: Conveyor Safety - WCF
Manufacturing: Conveyor Safety. Safeguards. Ensure proper training has been given to the employee for the machine they will operate. Look for moving parts that interact with other moving parts and present nip points. Ensure that appropriate guards are in place. If guards interrupt the movement of the belt, provide a barrier that restricts easy
