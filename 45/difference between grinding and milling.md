## What is the Difference Between Turning, Drilling and Milling Operations 
Drilling produces a round hole in a workpiece. A tapping or drill press machine performs drilling operations. However, drilling can also be handled with a milling machine. When machining a workpiece, chips are the waste material produced during the machining process. The way the drill bit is shaped enables chips to fall away from the workpiece.

## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.

## Hard Turning Versus Grinding | Production Machining
Lori Beckman. Senior Editor, Production Machining. Hard turning is often considered a replacement for grinding operations or as a pre-grinding process. It is most often performed on post-heat treated parts with surface hardness ranging from 45 HRC to 68 HRC or higher. Grinding, however, achieves higher tolerances than hard turning, but in cases
