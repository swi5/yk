## Beneficiation of an Indian non-coking coal by column flotation
Beneficiation of non-coking coal is gaining ground in India. It not only reduces the volume of inert content to be transported to the power plant and also lowers the wear in the boiler houses. For special applications such as the fuel for integrated gasification combined cycle plant (IGCC), the ash content in the coal should preferably be below 15 %. Indian coals are characterized by high

## Tribo-electrostatic behaviour of high ash non-coking Indian thermal coal
However, these techniques are not economical for high ash non-coking coal in fine size fractions of − 500 μm. The dry beneficiation of coal is attractive due to easy handling of coal, lower energy cost, no dewatering and no drying of solids. Electrostatic separation for the beneficiation of coal is one such dry technique.

Abstract A new laboratory fluidised bed tribo-electrostatic separator has been assembled and the beneficiation potential of thermal non-coking coal from Hingula block of Talcher coal field, India, is examined on this separator. The uniqueness of the separator originates from the efficient tribo-electrification of coal material in the cylindrical fluidised bed with internal baffle system.

Indian coal industry is the world's third largest in terms of production and fourth largest in terms of proven coal resources. Coal deposits are of drift origin, high in ash content but low in sulphur. There are 20 major coalfields located in east and south eastern quadrant of the country. The coking coal reserves are less compared to the non coking coals and the good quality coking coals

## Electrostatic beneficiation of coal fly ash utilizing triboelectric 
A triboelectrostatic separation system for removing unburned carbon from coal fly ash is designed and evaluated. Fly ash from a coal-fired power plant is used as an accepted additive in concrete where it adds strength, sulfate resistance and reduced cost, provided acceptable levels of unburned carbon are maintained.

## electrostatic beneficiation of non coking coal
The total coal reserves are estimated to be 276 BT out of which nearly 85% is non-coking coal with 40-45% ash. However so far beneficiation of non-coking coal in India has been limited. But considering the scarcity of coking coal and the rise of new technologies of steel making utilising non-coking coal, complete beneficiation of same is required.

Sep 01, 2018 Dwari and Hanumantha Rao applied a fluidized bed tribo-electrostatic separator for the beneficiation of thermal non-coking coal. The effects of tribo-charging and applied voltage conditions on the separation performance were tested on different size fractions and the smallest size fractions were − 75 + 45 μm and − 45 μm.

## Electrostatic Beneficiation Of Non Coking Coal
Dec 01, 2008 A new laboratory fluidised bed tribo-electrostatic separator has been assembled and the beneficiation potential of thermal non-coking coal from Hingula block of Talcher coal field, India, is examined on this separator. The uniqueness of the separator originates from the efficient tribo-electrification of coal material in the
