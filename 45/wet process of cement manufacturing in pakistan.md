## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ‚Å∞C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of

Cement Manufacturing Process Phase 1: Raw Material Extraction. Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. Such raw materials are limestone, clay and sand. Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand & clay fulfill the need of silicon, iron and aluminum.

## What Are the Differences Between the Wet and Dry Processes of a Cement 
The wet process of cement manufacturing involves adding water to finely crushed raw material, such as limestone, clay or iron ore, in a proportion of 35 to 50 percent water to 50 to 65 percent raw material to make a slurry that is fed into a cement kiln, whereas no water is added in the dry process. Instead, the raw material is fed into the kiln in its dry state.

Wet Process The wet process method is manufacturing raw materials slurry with 32%-40% water content. Wet process method's advantage is that its good fluidity of raw materials slurry makes more even mixed materials and produces high-quality clinker. But it requires more heat consumption, so it is environment-friendly.
