A citric acid softener is a substance that binds metal ions, most commonly calcium and magnesium, in water. By binding them with a chelant, you can stop these minerals to get deposited on the surface of your shower walls or other places. However, overuse of citric acid can react with your alkaline cleaning detergent, making it less effective.

In the method, calcium components of impure dolomitic marbles are extracted as calcium sucrate which is then bubbled with carbon dioxide gas using a carbonation column in the presence of PEG. The effects of concentration of PEG, pH of calcium sucrate solution and temperature on the final yield, morphology and polymorphism of PCC have been studied.
