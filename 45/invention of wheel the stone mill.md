## The Untold History of The Wheel And Its Evolution
A Brief History of Wheels. A wheel, or a symmetrical unit revolving on an axis, forms the basic component of any given mechanized system today, whether it is a watch or a jet engine. The world moves on wheels today, but the inception of this technology can be traced back to 3500 BC in Mesopotamia. The revolutionary invention of the wheel.

Because it's an OLED, the LG C1 doesn't have a backlight, but it can still emulate the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of LED TVs by turning its pixels on and off. For that reason, it isn't flicker-free; the slight dip in brightness you can see in the chart every 8 ms is due to the TV's 120Hz refresh rate, but it shouldn't be noticeable.

Dec 20, 2020The oldest wheel found in archeological excavations was discovered in what was Mesopotamia and is believed to be over 5,500 years old. It was not used for transportation, though, but rather as a potter's wheel. The combination of the wheel and axle made possible early forms of transportation, which became more sophisticated over time with the development of other technologies.
