## recovery of silver by using sodium carbonate
For the synthesis of ZnO doped with transition metal (silver) a solid mixture of 1 -5% AgNO 3 in ZnSO 4.7H 2O was dissolved separately in 50 ml distilled water and then mixed with buffer solution of sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide, followed by the same procedure as for undoped ZnO. Sodium hydroxide precipitates the silver oxide.

## Silver Recovery from Acid Solution - Pyrometallurgy: Roasting, Smelting 
While working in Ecuador I recovered more than a kilo of silver that had been dissolved by using too much salt water in a process tank by adding silver nitrate solution to eliminate the excess Cl- ions. I do not recommend it, but lead nitrate or mercury nitrate would also work to remove the excess Cl- ions to recover the silver from solution.

## Clean Silver With Baking Soda And Aluminum Foil
Spread your baking soda and salt on the bottom of the pan. Lay your silverware in the bottom of the pan. Make sure the silverware is firmly touching the aluminum foil and not touching each other. Add your boiling water to the pan. Allow silver to soak for 2-3 minutes. Heavily tarnished pieces may take more time (up to 15 minutes).
