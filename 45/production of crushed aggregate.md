The Udden-Wentworth scale categorizes gravel into either granule with 2mm to 4 mm (0.079-0.157 inches) particle sizes or pebbles with 4mm to 64 mm (0.2-2.5 inches) particles. Granule gravel is sub-divided into very fine and fine, while pebble gravel has three sub-categories, i.e., medium, coarse, and very coarse.
