## Iron and titanium: a review of iron and ilmenite deposits in Québec
Exploration for iron and titanium deposits and mining of ilmenite deposits has been going on for one hundred years in Québec. The development, in the 1940s, of blast furnace fusion technology made it  sources of iron, titanium and vanadium. In the case of the Doré Lake Complex, the magnetite is vanadium bearing. However, mining is impeded

## Titaniferous magnetites as a source of vanadium titanium and iron - AusIMM
Titaniferous magnetite hard rock deposits are common throughout the world. Previously they have been processed to recover vanadium using the standard salt roast process, however the economics based on vanadium alone can be marginal due to the high CAPEX and OPEX, making it vulnerable in a volatile vanadium market. New Zealand Steel and others have produced vanadium slag by iron reduction and

## Vanadium | Geology for Investors
Vanadium (V) is a hard but malleable silver-grey metal. It rarely occurs in nature in its pure metallic form, but is commonly found as a compound in other minerals. Vanadium-bearing minerals, such as vanadinite (Pb 5 (VO 4) 3 Cl), patronite (VS 4) and carnotite (K 2 (UO 2) 2 (VO 4) 2 ·3H 2 O) have been mined historically.

## Titanium
Titanium is a chemical element with the symbol Ti and atomic number 22. Found in nature only as an oxide, it can be reduced to produce a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength, resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.. Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich

## Making Vanadium | Vanitec
Ferrovanadium is available in alloys containing 40%, 60% or 80% vanadium. The 60% and 80% grades are mostly produced by the aluminothermic reduction of vanadium oxides in the presence of steel scrap or by direct reduction in an electric furnace. The 40% grade is produced from slag and other vanadium products by the silicon reduction process.

## Iron Ore in India
Iron ore is found abundantly in the country. In fact, India is considered as one of the rich iron ore reserves. India is one of the richest sources of iron ore deposits in the world. Iron ore, which is also known as hematite, occurs in abundance in the country. Iron ore reserves account for almost two-third of the entire iron ore reserves in India.

## Mount Peake Vanadium-Iron-Titanium Project, Australia
The vanadium-iron-titanium deposit discovered by TNG in 2008 is located within the Neoproterozoic sediments of the Georgina Basin. The ore body is hosted by a differentiated basic sill with minor ultrabasic layers. The predominant rock type is olivine gabbro and the mineralised unit is defined by high concentration of magnetite.
