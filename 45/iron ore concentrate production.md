## Iron Concentrate - Eco - English Wiki
Dec 20, 2021Iron Concentrate is created by purifying Crushed Iron Ore. This can be done in one of two ways: either dry or wet purification, each of which can be performed using one of two crafting stations. The crafting stations come with different ratios, labor cost and time. The process to make Iron Concentrate also gives a by-product of either Tailings or Wet Tailings, each of which are pollutants.

## Production of an Iron Ore Super-Concentrate From the Samarco  - AusIMM
With the aim of producing a concentrate with silica content lower than 1.0 per cent SiO2, laboratory experiments were conducted using a sample of the final concentrate from the Samarco iron ore flotation plant (mechanical cells circuit). The sample contained 3.08 per cent SiO2. This sample was split in two size ranges: >105 m and <105 m. The <105 m fraction, representing 76.7 per cent of the
