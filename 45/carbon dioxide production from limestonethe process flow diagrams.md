Liquid CO2 Production. At a very high-pressure liquid CO2 gas is commercially generated by reducing the vaporous Carbon dioxide gas in a multi-process compressor to constraints in the connection of 69 bar (1000,76 psi) pressure and consequently cooling it to 18 °C (64,4 °F). The gas is traditionally filled into specially formed storage cylinders.
