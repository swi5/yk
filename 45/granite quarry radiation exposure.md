In high enough concentrations, prolonged exposure can lead to lung cancer. But radon problems are easily fixed in a home with the installation of radon venting equipment. Scientists have determined that granite countertops do not significantly contribute to radon concentrations in a home. What is Radiation? Radiation is also naturally occurring.

## Natural radioactivity measurements in the granite rock of quarry sites 
The gamma radiation dose for the occupational work in granite mines (Quarry Sites) is due to the granite content of radionuclides which can be estimated by employing a half-infinite source of a homogenous distribution and by considering only the contribution gamma-radiation dose, from the natural radionuclides in the granite.

## Assessing exposure to granite countertops--Part 1: Radiation
The estimated annual radiation dose from spending 4 h/day in a hypothetical kitchen ranged from 0.005 to 0.18 mSv/a depending on the type of granite. In summary, our results show that the types of granite characterized in this study contain varying levels of radioactive isotopes and that their observed emissions are consistent with those

## Assessment of occupational exposure in a granite quarry and processing 
Three main potential pathways were observed: external irradiation, inhalation of granite dust, and radon exposure. The external dose rate was similar to that in a nearby farming area. A slight increment (0.016-0.076 mSv yr-1) was observed in the quarry and stockpile, due to quarry faces and granite blocks.

## Granite and Radon
Thorium produces a different type of gas called Thoron. Thorium is a shorter-lived element, which is similar to radon but decays about 6,500 times faster than radon. Thoron has a half-life of about 51 seconds, whereas Radon has a half-life of just over 92 hours. Because most of the Thoron never makes it very far from the granite's surface
