## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics - ThoughtCo
History . Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore, leaving behind a soft, malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.

## Archaeometallurgical slag
The ores used in ancient smelting processes were rarely pure metal compounds. Impurities were removed from the ore through the process of slagging, which involves adding heat and chemicals. Slag is the material in which the impurities from ores (known as gangue), as well as furnace lining and charcoal ash, collect. The study of slag can reveal information about the smelting process used at the

used. For the tailings concrete being studied, iron ore tailings were used together with the cement to make the new concrete. The iron ore tailings were obtained from Mount Gibson Iron Extension Hill Operations in Perenjori of Western Australia (WA). The particle-size distribution curve of the original tailings as obtained is shown in Figure 1.
