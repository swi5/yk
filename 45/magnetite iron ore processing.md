## Hematite vs Magnetite: What Are They, And What's The Difference?
Almost all sedimentary iron deposits contain hematite and magnetite along with other minerals. These materials are often in close association though both contain iron in different oxidation states. Magnetite holds a higher content of iron and is easier to process, but hematite is leading in iron ore production because it is more abundant.

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
