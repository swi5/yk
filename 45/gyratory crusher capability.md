## Advantages and Disadvantages of Gyratory Crusher over Jaw Crusher 
Disadvantages of gyratory crusher: (1) The gyratory crusher is twice the height of the jaw crusher, as a result of which, the construction expenditure of the plant is high. (2) The weight of this machine is 1.7~2 times higher than that of the jaw crusher with the same feeding size, so the investment fee is higher. (3) Gyratory crusher is not

The jaw crusher will handle sticky,'or dirty feed better than the gyratory, there being no diaphragm below the crushing chamber on which such material can pack. Routine maintenance and repair jobs are generally more easily accomplished on the jaw crusher than on the gyratory. Major repairs are about a stand-off.

Gyratory concaves engineered for better wear, less downtime. We use the hardest alloy that will withstand the impacts of a specific gyratory application. This depends on the compressive strength, toughness, and friability of the material being crushed. For example, crushing some tough materials demands work-hardening manganese steel.
