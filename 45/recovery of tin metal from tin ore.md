## Tin recovery from a low-grade tin middling with high Si content and low 
A new method for separating and recovering tin from a low-grade tin middling with high Si content and low Fe content by roasting with anthracite coal was researched by studying the reaction mechanism and performing an industrial test, in which the Sn was sulfurized into SnS(g) and then collected using a dust collector. The Fe-Sn alloy may be formed at roasting temperatures above 950°C, and

## Tin Ore Extraction - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The flowsheet below Explains the Extraction of Tin Ore as shown by a study adapted to the concentration of a lode tin deposit.Cassiterite (SnO2) is very friable and special considerations to crushing and grinding of the ore are necessary to avoid an excessive production of fines. The Mineral Jig is an important feature of this flowsheet to recover the coarse free tin mineral as soon as liberated.
