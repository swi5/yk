## Iron Ore Pellet - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In a DR process, iron ore pellets and/or lump iron ores are reduced by a reducing gas to produce DRI or hot briquetted iron (HBI). Depending on the generation of the reducing gas, two different DR processes are commercially available: gas-based and coal/oil-based.

The pelletizing process is a process which contains numerous sub-processes, or process segments. On the way from the mine to a final product, the iron ore goes through the following main process segments: 1) The iron ore is crushed and the waste rock is removed. About 85 % of the particles should be less than 44 μm (in length, width, or height).

## Heat Powder Activator
Soda ash is the active ingredient in washing soda Inhaling fine particles may cause adverse effects It takes 5-10 mins to heat up It is a safe chemical reaction caused when you have air, iron powder, water, vermiculite, wood and salt As ingredients mix with air, they react to generate heat Vilene has rebranded as Vlieseline Vilene has rebranded

## Pelletizing - Assignment Point
Pelletizing of iron ore. The principle behind pelletizing processes is the opposite of grinding technology: it consists of gathering together or clustering fine solid particles in order to form elements of larger dimensions. Iron ore pellets are spheres of typically 6-16 mm (0.24-0.63 in) to be used as raw material for blast furnaces.
