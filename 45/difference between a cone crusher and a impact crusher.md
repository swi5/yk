## Impact vs cone crushers: Which is more effective? - Quarry
The post-primary crushing sector is largely divided into impact crushers for the processing of softer stone and cone crushers for the processing of harder, more abrasive stone. The advantages of both machines are well known. The impact crusher, for example, has a higher co-efficient of reduction, produces crushed material with an optimal cubic

## What Is the Difference Between Cone Crusher and Impact Crusher?
The impact crusher belongs to the percussion crusher. The material is broken with small fineness and good shaping effect, but at the same time it produces high noise and dust pollution. In contrast, the cone crusher belongs to the extrusion type, and the pollution is relatively small in terms of noise or spilled dust.

## Comparison between Cone Crusher and Jaw Crusher - Virily
A Jaw crusher is used for the purpose of primary crushing. Thus the stones fed as input are of a large size. A jaw crusher is able to crush a material in the range of 125 mm to 1500 mm. A cone crusher is used for secondary crushing. The input to the cone crusher is much smaller and fragmented than that in the jaw crusher.
