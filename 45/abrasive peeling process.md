yields with the brine peeling method, good results with abrasive peeling and better with the steam peeling batch process. High tempera­ ture lye peeling wa judged best. Werner, 1950( 10), discu sing the economy of peeling as affected by size of tubers, mentioned that peeling losses were less with large than with small sizes.

## What is Abrasive Machining? - SME
Abrasive machining is not considered to be a precision grinding process, but that's not to say it isn't precise. Abrasive machining can take the place of "large-chip" machining processes like milling, planing, broaching, and turning. Compare the surface finish and the precision achieved with the large-chip processes to the surface

## Sweep Blasting Galvanized Steel - American Galvanizers Association
Flaking of the coating usually happens in bigger and stiffer chunks with much more defined edges. Sweep blasting the galvanized coating is a common step done during preparation for painting galvanized steel. Sweep blasting increases the profile of the galvanized coating and thereby allows for increased adhesion of the paint to the coating.

The abrasive part of the element removes/opens the outer skin of the raw material. This part of the process provides the knife element with a long user lifetime. Since the hard skin of the raw material is partially removed, the knife peeling is therefore easier. The FORMIT COMBI-peelers can be used without the addition of water into the peeling

Batch-wise the raw materials (roots, tubers) are treated in a pressure vessel and exposed to high-pressure steam (°C). In the case of tomatoes, the temperature may be lower (°C). The high temperature causes a rapid heating and cooking

## JFB | Free Full-Text | Bone Abrasive Machining: Influence of Tool 
The abrasive machining of cortical tissue is used in many arthroplasties and craniofacial surgery procedures. However, this method requires further research due to the processes' complexity and the tissue's composite structure. Therefore, studies were carried out to assess the impact of grid geometry and the anisotropic structure of bone tissue on the cutting process and crack propagation.

Manual application of the abrasive coating to the peel disc is very time consuming. The replacement of peeling discs is an unwieldy process and takes up a lot of time. At least two peeling discs are necessary for each type of crop in order to avoid machine downtime and to permit one peeling disc to be sent away for recoating. A coarser peeling disc is necessary for potatoes than for peeling

Abrasive wear. Abrasive wear is called abrasive wear, which is caused by a cutting action caused by a hard object such as a foreign matter, or an action in which a hard gear shaves a soft tooth surface due to a difference in the height of the tooth surface. In particular, the former is called three-way wear, and the latter is called two-way wear.
