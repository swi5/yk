## Basics Of Copper Porphyry Deposits For Investors (2022)
Jul 11, 2022The ore in copper porphyry deposits is usually located between the potassic and phyllic alternations. There is a pyrite halo surrounding the ore. Chlorite, calcide, epidote, and adularia are commonly present in the propylitic alteration. Pyrite is commonly found in the phyllic alteration.

## Everything you need to know about copper porphyries [infographic]
Porphyry deposits are very large, polymetallic systems that typically contain copper along with other important metals. Much of today's mineral production depends on porphyries: 60% of copper, 95% of molbdenum, and 20% of gold comes from this deposit type.

## Porphyry Copper Deposits | Geology for Investors
Porphyry copper deposits are typically very-low grade with between 0.4 and 1% copper. The main mineral is chalcopyrite, which is finely disseminated through the host porphyritic rocks. The only reason these ore bodies are economic is because porphyries are huge, with hundreds of millions of tonnes available in a fairly low-cost mining setting.

Fifty to seventy-five years ago, geologists such as Emmons, Locke, Lindgren, Sales, and Perry developed genetic concepts about porphyry copper deposits and their associated high-grade veins, breccias, and skarns which are still valid, such as their relations to granitic plutons and the evolutionary nature of their development.

## PORPHYRY DEPOSITS - Earth Sci
The term porphyry copper now includes engineering as well as geological considerations; It refers to large, relatively low grade, epigenetic, intrusion-related deposits that can be mined using mass mining techniques. Geologically, the deposits occur close to or in granitic intrusive rocks that are porphyritic in texture.

Porphyry copper deposits form in continental magmatic arcs along convergent plate-margin boundaries or in island-arc environments. The deposits are associated with subduction-related volcanic centers, although in some examples, they are thought to be associated with postcollisional volcanism. Permissive magmatic-arc environments may be
