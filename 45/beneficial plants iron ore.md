Iron Ore | Geoscience Australia. Almost all iron ore is used in blast furnaces to make pig iron, which is the main material for steelmaking. Small amounts of iron ore are used in other applications such as coal wash plants and cement manufacturing. Iron is the most used metal accounting for about 95% of total metal tonnages produced worldwide.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

Limestone raises the pH level to a neutral range beneficial to plants, typically between 5.5 and 6.5. If the pH is acidic and below 5.5, or if the pH is alkaline and above 6.5, this will create a nutrient deficiency in your plants. You can improve the nutritional quality of your crops by using limestone in the recommended amount.
