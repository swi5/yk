Through a second series of experiments, the effect of coal rank properties on product size and airborne dust generation was studied using auniform crushing process with secondary breakage. Laboratory results indicate that secondary breakage of a particular coal notably increases the specific amount of ATD generated, while negligibly impacting the specific amounts of ARD generated.
