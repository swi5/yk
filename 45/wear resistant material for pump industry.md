## The cobalt drill bit will dissipate heat quicker and ultimately assist 
Alloy 954 Aluminum Bronze (C95400) There are many recommended uses for 954 aluminum bronze, some of which include weld guns, nuts, bearings, pump parts, bushings and gears. This all-purpose alloy resists wear and deformation under extreme loads and stress. Alloy 954 has a machinability rating of 60% along with high ductility and weld ability.

## Wear Mechanisms And Materials - Centrifugal Pumps - Beyond Discovery
Understanding wear and using the correct materials is key in the design of a slurry pump. The major erosive mechanisms are sliding abrasion and particle impact. The sliding-abrasion mode of wear typically involves a bed of contact-load particles bearing against a surface and moving tangentially to it, as illustrated on Figure 15.

## Wear protection of pump components using hard coatings
The torch manipulation is generally automated and hence can achieve uniform overlays on complex parts. The PTA process is typically used to apply relatively thick (i.e. 2-3 mm) wear and/or corrosion resistant cobalt (Stellite and Triballoy ) and nickel (Inconel 625 ) alloys. Stellite 6 is a well know overlay in the pump and valve industry.

## Coatings for Corrosion Resistance & Efficiency | Pumps & Systems
Coatings to resist wear and corrosion are extensively used for pump parts requiring greater wear and corrosion resistance than can be obtained from an economic base material. When coating for corrosion resistance, it is important that the coating system is free of porosity. Some commonly used coating systems for wear and corrosion resistance are discussed below.
