## Gold Mining Process
Nov 1, 2021The gold mining process is complex and goes beyond what most people imagine — miners in hard hats working underground or operating large, noisy mining equipment are images that often come to mind. However, the actual mining of gold ore is only one step in a complex gold mining process. Before miners can extract gold ore from the ground

In the sand gold deposits, the gold usually exists in the form of monomer natural gold, and its particle size is generally more than 16t/m 3, which has a big difference with gangue density, so gravity separation method is the most effective and economic gold mining process. However, gravity separation method is rarely used alone in the lode

The gold in the ore dissolves in this cyanide solution and is then filtered, and the solids are separated. The gold is later filtered from the solution—the process of cyanidation changes with the ore's gold content. If the gold content is more than 20 grams per ton of ore, a process called vat leaching is practiced. In this process, large

One of the major areas in which operators can not only become more efficient, but also cut energy and production costs, is in the processing of the gold. Importantly, unlike coal processing, gold processing currently involves the use of environmentally hazardous cyanide, adding a raft of legal and regulatory burdens to operating.

Refiners increase the purity by separating the other precious metals and less precious metals that are mined with it. Using induction heating, doré bars and scrap are turned into molten metal.
