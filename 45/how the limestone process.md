## Limestone Mining Process
What is limestone? The main component of limestone is calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Lime and limestone are widely used as building materials and are also important raw materials for many industries. Calcium carbonate can be directly processed into stone and burned into quicklime, but it is also dangerous in the production process.

Limestone rock is a sedimentary rock which forms in the process of sedimentation at the bottom of lakes and oceans, or in caves. It is mainly composed of mineral calcite and aragonite, both of which are crystal forms of calcium carbonate. A limestone with 95 percent or more of calcium carbonate by weight is known as a high-calcium limestone.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

Therefore the limestone, the soil, the mud and the groundwater would have all been frozen solid, making the rock impermeable, meaning that water could not seep into it. At the same time as the limestone was impermeable due to permafrost, there were massive outflows of melting glacier water, making a fast flowing powerful river right here.

Some limestone, due to its crystalline structure, disintegrates during the calcination process. This type of limestone is not useful for calcining. There is some other limestone whose behaviour is the opposite. This type of limestone become so dense during calcination that it prevents the escape of CO2 and become non porous.

Limestone, or calcium carbonate, is the common rock found throughout the world. Oldest and perhaps slightly overlooked, limestone is very much part of our everyday life.  Mostly it's due to the algal and bacterial metabolism as the process involves high consumption of carbon dioxide, resulting in saturation of calcium carbonate.

## Limestone: Characteristics, Uses And Problem | GSA
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed principally of calcium carbonate (calcite) or the double carbonate of calcium and magnesium (dolomite). It is commonly composed of tiny fossils, shell fragments and other fossilized debris. These fossils are frequently visible to the unaided eye on close examination of the stone surface, however this is
