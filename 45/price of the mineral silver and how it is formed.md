The luster of silver also makes it an attractive option to produce coins and jewelry. It is neither abundant as iron and copper, nor is rare and precious as gold. Due to all these reasons, silver was minted into coins in a pre-BC era in the Mediterranean region. This recently minted coin is 1 ounce, .999 fine silver, non-graded.

## How Is Silver Formed?
It is formed by forming compounds with sulfur. Due to hot temperature, salty water called brine dissolves, collects and concentrates silver into the brine. Once the brine mixes with cold sea water, the metal does not stay dissolved and precipitates on the sea floor as minerals. Silver is classified as a transition and precious metal.

This is done by heating the rock and submerging it in water. If metals float to the surface in the form of dark grime, then silver ore could be present in the rock. Additionally, because it is rarely found by itself in nature, keeping an eye out for certain minerals that tend to accompany silver can also help in finding and identifying the ore.

## What Country Produces The Most Silver - Realonomics
Poland has three of the largest silver mines in the world and gold-rich Australia also has significant silver deposits. Where does most of the silver come from? Silver can be found across many geographies but about 57% of the world's silver production comes from the Americas with Mexico and Peru supplying 40%. Outside of the Americas China

## Silver mining
Silver mining is the extraction of silver from minerals, starting with mining. Because silver is often found in intimate combination with other metals, its extraction requires elaborate technologies. In 2008, ca.25,900 metric tons were consumed worldwide, most of which came from mining. [1]

## What are Energy Minerals? (With Examples) | Life Persona
Metallic resources are things like gold, silver, tin, copper, lead, zinc, iron, nickel, chromium and aluminum. Nonmetallic resources are things like sand, gravel, gypsum, halite, uranium, dimension stone. Characteristics of energy minerals . An energetic mineral or mineral resource is a rock enriched with one or more useful materials.

## National Minerals Information Center | U.S. Geological Survey
The quantity of ore mined and waste rock (i.e., overburden or barren rock) removed to produce a refined unit of a mineral commodity, its rock-to-metal ratio (RMR), is an important metric for understanding mine wastes and environmental burdens. In this analysis, we provide a comprehensive examination of RMRs for 25 commodities for 2018.

## Silver - HyperPhysics Concepts
Silver bonds to tellurium in the mineral hessite, Ag 2 Te. Gold and silver combine with tellurium to form the mineral sylvanite, AgAuTe 4. Silver appears in the chloride minerals boleite and chlorargyrite and the bromide mineral bromargyrite. Silver is one of the few exceptions to the general order of filling of electron orbitals like copper
