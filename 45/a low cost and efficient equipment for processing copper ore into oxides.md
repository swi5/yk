EnviCat® SCR Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is a robust and cost effective technology for reduction of NOx from diesel exhaust. The NOx reacts with NH3. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is a chemical process converting nitrogen oxides (NOx) into diatomic nitrogen and water as well as a small amount of carbon dioxide.
