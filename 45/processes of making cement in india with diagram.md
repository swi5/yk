## Cement Manufacturing Process - Chemical Engineering World
Sep 26, 2020Cement is a material which is used to bind other materials together. Binding means it has an effect of gluing the substances together due to cohesive and adhesive action and then hardens and sets in order to become permanent. Cement is usually not used on its own; it is mixed with other materials called aggregates to produce a combined material

Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

## Chemical industry
This is a process diagram of a turbine generator. Engineers working to produce a sustainable process for use in the chemical industry need to know how to design a sustainable process in which the system can withstand or manipulate process-halting conditions such as heat, friction, pressure, emissions, and contaminants.  and portland cement
