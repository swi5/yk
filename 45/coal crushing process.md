The coal is conveyed from the bin at 1,200 tonnes per hour on an apron feeder through a primary crusher where it is sized to less than 200mm. The coal is then conveyed to a screen where it is sized to either less than or more than 50mm. The more than 50mm product stream goes to a secondary crusher to be crushed to under 50mm.

The zeolite used in freshwater aquariums can be recharged by soaking it in a 5% salt solution, which causes it to release the ammonia it has absorbed. After soaking for 24 hours spread it on a cookie tray and allow it to dry in the sun for a day or two. A faster alternative is to bake it in an oven for a half-hour to an hour at 350 F to dry it out.

Coal is very friable (breaks easily) so you do not need the force a cone crusher can supply. Also a cone will create more fines than a roll crusher. Another factor being that both roll crushers and impactors take up less height than a cone so the overall height can be less. AshKot1 3 years ago Like
