## Quarry Tile Vs. Ceramic Tile | Hunker
Quarry tiles are made of red clay that is either hand- or machine-shaped. The quarry tiles are dried before being fired in large beehive-style kilns. The clay is fired to extremely high temperatures — much higher than ceramic tiles — which renders the quarry tiles naturally dense, nonporous and water resistant with a low water absorption rate.
