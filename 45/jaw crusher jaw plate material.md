## Jaw Crusher Plate - EB Castworld
At present, the most common jaw plate is the high manganese steel with water toughening treatment. Due to work hardening, its hardness can reach 650Hv from 200Hv. Even so, the surface of the tooth plate will often be uneven due to extrusion under long-term working conditions., There are scratches formed by the cutting of materials.
