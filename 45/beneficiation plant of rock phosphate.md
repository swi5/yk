Some RPs are calcined during beneficiation to remove impurities, to increase P concentration, or to make Fe- and Al-phosphate impurities more available to plants (Milnes 1976). These RPs may also be used as direct application fertilisers but the effect of calcination on the agronomic effectiveness is likely to be adverse (Khasawneh et al. 1980).
