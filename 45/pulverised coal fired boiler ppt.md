## Pulverized coal-fired boiler
A pulverized coal-fired boiler is an industrial or utility boiler that generates thermal energy by burning pulverized coal (also known as powdered coal or coal dust since it is as fine as face powder in cosmetic makeup) that is blown into the firebox.. The basic idea of a firing system using pulverised fuel is to use the whole volume of the furnace for the combustion of solid fuels.

The pulverising mill grinds the coal at a steady rate irrespective of boiler feed. 2. There is always some coal in reserve. Thus any occasional breakdown in the coal supply will not affect the coal feed to the burner. 3. For a given boiler capacity pulverising mill of small capacity will be required as compared to unit system.
