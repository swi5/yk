How does a hammer crusher work? Hammer crusher mainly depends on the impact to break the materials. The crushing process is as follows: The material fed into the hammer mill crusher is first crushed by the impact of the high-speed moving hammer head, and at the same time, it obtains kinetic energy, and flies to the crushing plate on the inner wall of the casing at high speed to be crushed again.
