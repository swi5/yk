## chOKE feediNG CONE CrusHEr
The optimal arrangement for a cone crusher is to choke feed it with a non-segregated feed. This will help the crusher run more smoothly by lowering both power and pressure peaks and improving overall performance. Choke feeding is about maintaining a constantly high level of evenly distributed material in the feed hopper.
