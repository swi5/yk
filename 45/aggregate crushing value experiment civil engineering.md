The aggregate crushing value is a measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually increasing compressive load. The ten per cent fines value test is similar except that the force which causes ten per cent fines is determined. The aggregate impact value is carried out by subjecting an aggregate to 15 blows of a hammer.

3.2.1 Aggregate Crushing Value: As a result of the experiment, the aggregate crushing value is 22.33 percent. The road would have a longer life span if it was constructed using aggregate that had a lower crushing value since this would suggest a lower crushed percentage under load. Less robust material would be crushed by the weight of the traffic.

## Aggregate Testing Lab Equipment - Sun LabTek
Scratch hardness apparatus: Aggregate Testing Lab Equipment This apparatus is used in the field to determine the quantity of soft particles in coarse aggregate. It consists of a metal rod with a rounded point of 1.6 mm diameter, which is mounted in a device so that a load of 8.9 ± 4 N is.. Details.

 · The aggregate crushing value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. Crushing value is a measure of the strength of the aggregate. The aggregates should therefore have minimum crushing value. 3. APPARATUS. Aggregate Crushing Value - Civil Engineering Portal
