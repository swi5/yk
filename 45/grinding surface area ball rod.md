## grinding surface area ball rod
Apr 09, 2015 Because of balls have greater ratio of surface area than rods they are more suitable for fine grinding. Balls are also lighter, so the kinetic energy of a single dropping ball is smaller than a rod. The lining material is of great importance as there is a significant amount of wear taking place due to the action of the steel balls.

## Grinding Balls & Rods - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
For the first stage of grinding, media will generally be in the 4″ to 2″ size (in some cases as high as 5″). In secondary finer grinding the initial charge will begin at around 3″ and in the case of balls will grade down to about ¾". Extremely fine grinding will dictate the use of 1½" and smaller balls. Grinding media is the working part of a mill.
