## Everything About Graphite | SGL Carbon
Flexible graphite - also known as expanded graphite or exfoliated graphite - is produced from purified natural graphite flakes. In the manufacturing process the flakes are mixed with a highly oxidizing acid to produce graphite intercalation compounds. These are expanded by a sudden application of high temperature.
