The specific energy consumption at the motor input can be predicted using Bond's equation: E = 10 × CWi × (P80 - ½ - F80 -½). where CWi is your work index, F80 is the 80% passing size of the feed measured in µm, and P80 is the 80% passing size of the product measured in µm. E is the specific energy in kWh/tonne. Very important -- there are five types of work index.
