## Cement and Lime | Tunstead - Tarmac
Limestone is heated in kilns to extremely high temperatures to induce a chemical reaction that produces calcium oxide, or quicklime. Quicklime is used in iron and steel manufacturing and for the production of aerated concrete blocks. It can also be processed into hydrated lime, which is used in a wide range of industries including construction

## How is concrete made from limestone? | Shelly Company
To make Portland cement—the most common type of cement—powdered limestone is heated in a rotary kiln. As a source of calcium, it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker, which is then ground with a source of sulfate, like gypsum. It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete.

Producers know that replacing some of the clinker in portland cement with ground limestone offers benefits, the most important being that it reduces the embodied CO2 of the cement. Modifying a concrete mix design to replace higher carbon materials with lower carbon ingredients is an effective strategy to reduce its environmental footprint.
