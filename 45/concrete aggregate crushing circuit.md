## How to Use Glass Aggregate in Concrete - TERRAZZCO
To reveal the glass aggregates in either a terrazzo or concrete floor, polishing and grinding techniques are employed. Contractors can also use exposed aggregate techniques, or broadcast the glass across the surface and expose it afterward. In regards to color options, glass is appealing to contractors because of its wide range.

Crushing in an impact crusher takes place when the stone is struck by the spinning impact bars, and by that stone being flung against an apron. When impact crushing is used, the striking of the aggregate by the spinning rotor's blow bars knocks off or breaks the elongated fractures. This process is repeated by an impactor in the secondary stage.

Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. After harvesting, aggregate is processed: crushed, screened, and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.

## Crushed Concrete Aggregate| Concrete Construction Magazine
Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) refers to crushed concrete and other materials suitable for use as fill and compactible fill. Initiatives to use CCA in concrete mixes have proceeded slowly and cautiously for many reasons. A central concern is whether CCA can have the same quality as virgin materials—a pile of demolished concrete could have
