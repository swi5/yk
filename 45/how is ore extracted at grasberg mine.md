In placer mining, the gold is retrieved by metal detecting, panning, cradling, sluicing and dredging. Using gravity and water to separate the dense gold from the other materials that surround it, this is the most common gold mining category for amateur gold hunters. Hard rock mining is the process of using open pit or underground mining tunnels

## Underground Paste Plant Helps Indonesian Mine Fit Into  - Golder
The Grasberg Mine in Papua, Indonesia is one of the most remote, complex mining operations in the world.  The copper/gold ore body is being extracted by the blast hole stoping method, in which stopes are excavated to remove the ore. To safely mine the adjacent stopes, the mined stope must be refilled with paste backfill, made up of
