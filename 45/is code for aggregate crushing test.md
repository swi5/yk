## Crushed stone size chartnet.pl
Typical sizes are 3/8 minus, 1/4 minus and track fines. True decomposed granite materials have irregular semi round quartz "gravel" aggregates in the 3/8" minus mix. Crushed Stone Fines are almost always are similar to decomposed granite but instead of a high level of quartz (sand like material ) aggregates and fines, they have semi flat stone.

## Aggregate Crushing Strength Test - Online CivilForum
The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.
