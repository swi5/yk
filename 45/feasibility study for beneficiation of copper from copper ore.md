Mar 18, 2022Generally, the copper ore is crushed to 0-5mm or 0-9mm, and then grouped by winch or vibrating table: 1) Separation of lean and rich ore. Some sedimentary primary copper oxide ores are depleted due to mining, and heavy media and jigs are used to remove gangue to obtain massive concentrates. 2) Separation of coarse and fine ore.
