## Knowledge Representation in Data Mining
Mining and analyzing such data may be time consuming.  Data discretization method is used to reduce the size of the data. In this method, a continuous attribute is divided into intervals. Dividing the range of attributes into the interval can reduce the number of values for the given continuous attributes.

## Data science
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.. Data science is a "concept to unify statistics
