## Setting Time of Cement Concrete - Stages and Processes
Stages of Setting of Cement The setting process of cement starts as it is mixed with water. The chemical phenomenon that takes place are divided into 3 stages, 1. Hydrolysis and Hydration Stage The process of setting starts after the addition of water. In this process the four compounds of cement (C 3 S, C 2 S, 3CA1, 4CAFe) get hydrated.

## Setting Time of Concrete | Concrete Retarder | Allied Concrete
Air temperature, ground temperature and weather conditions all play major roles in the rate with which cement hydrates. The setting time of concrete decreases with a rise in temperature, but above 30 o C a reverse effect could be observed. At low temperatures setting time is retarded. Proper curing techniques and site preparation will aid the

## Concrete Set Time - Slag Cement
At temperatures less than 85 degrees Fahrenheit, concrete containing slag cement can have longer times of set, when compared with 100 percent portland cement concrete. The lower the ambient and/or concrete temperatures, the slower the set times will be (Figure 1). The percentage of slag cement used can also affect times of set.

The specifics of the concrete cure time under favorable conditions go as follows: 1-3 days - no more than 30% 7-14 - 60-80% 28 - 100% If you want to make the foundation mortar quick-curing, you need to introduce special additives into its composition.

Various types of slag are produced: - Blast-furnace slag—The nonmetallic product, consisting essentially of silicates and aluminosilicates of calcium and of other bases, that is developed in a molten condition simultaneously with iron in a blast furnace.

## How does types of cement can affect the strength of concrete?
How does cement affect concrete? Cement plays a major role within a concrete mixture and affects most important aspects of the mix, such as: workability, compressive strength, drying shrinkage, and durability. Through the process of hydration, cement particles react with water, binding the aggregate, and the strength matrix develops (Weiss, 1999).
