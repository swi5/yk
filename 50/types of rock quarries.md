## P&Q University Lesson 7- Crushing & Secondary Breaking - Pit & Quarry
In the quarry, crushing is handled in four potential stages: primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. The reduction of aggregate is spread over these stages to better control the product size and quality, while minimizing waste. The primary stage was once viewed merely as a means to further reduce stone following the blast or excavation
