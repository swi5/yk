## Geologic Hazards in New Mexico.edu
Geologic Hazards. Aside from drought and flooding, natural disasters that affect large numbers of people seem to be infrequent in New Mexico. In part, this is because our population density is so low away from urban areas. However, we are still subject to many geologic hazards, including:

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.  The process is one of the simplest ways to extract gold, and is popular with geology enthusiasts especially because of its low cost and relative simplicity.  A major example of this hazard was demonstrated in the 2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill,

## Cyanide hazards to plants and animals from gold mining and  - USGS
Highly toxic sodium cyanide (NaCN) is used by the international mining community to extract gold and other precious metals through milling of high-grade ores and heap leaching of low-grade ores (Korte et al. 2000). The process to concentrate gold using cyanide was developed in Scotland in 1887 and was used almost immediately in the Witwatersrand gold fields of the Republic of South Africa.

##  Controlling Mercury Hazards in Gold Mining: a Best Practices Toolbox
A trend to increased underground gold mining is anticipated by many in the mining community. The U.S. Geological Survey has noted a trend to conversion from surface to underground gold mining as certain near-surface deposits reach depletion.20 Last year, for example, Barrick Gold Corporation opened a major new underground gold mine in Nevada

Geologic Hazards are naturally occurring (or man-made) geologic conditions capable of causing damage or loss of property and/or life. Geologic Hazards Mitigation is the application of geologic engineering principles to minimize or prevent the effects of naturally occurring geologic hazards. Geologic hazards phenomena can occur suddenly, or slowly.

## Geologic hazards of the Ocoña river valley, Peru and the influence of 
Over the last ~ 15 years, however, the population has swelled dramatically as small gold mining operations have developed (Malone et al., 2021). Because of the geography of the valley, these new residents often live in areas that are vulnerable to geologic hazards (Fig. 5). Furthermore, mine infrastructure and waste materials can exacerbate
