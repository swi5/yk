## What Are the Differences Between Wet Ball Mill and Dry Ball Mill?
3. Differences on grinding medium between wet ball mill and dry ball mill. On the grinding medium, the dry ball mill only needs to join the steel ball, while the wet ball mill needs to add liquid to participate in grinding except for steel ball. The commonly used proportion: steel ball: material: water = 4:2:1.

## What is the difference between CNC milling machines and CNC boring and 
CNC milling machine is developed on the basis of the general milling machine, both of the processing technology is basically the same, some similar structure, but CNC milling machine is controlled by the program of automatic processing machine, so its structure and ordinary milling machine has a big difference.

##  Comparison Between Diamond Grinding vs. Carbide Milling for Surface 
The main difference between diamond grinding and carbide milling is in the way that the cutting head removes the concrete layer. Diamond grinding uses closely spaced, diamond saw blades that gently abrade away the top surface of the concrete. On average, the diamond
