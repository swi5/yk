## Copper & the Environment: Copper in Brake Pads
The state of Washington signed SB6557 into law last March. California passed SB346 in September. Both bills mandate that brake pads sold in each state contain no more than a minimal 0.5% of copper by weight and must meet all applicable safety standards. The laws differ in timing. In California, the law takes effect no later than Jan. 1, 2025.

The liquid 'matte' is refined in a converter process where 'blister' copper is produced with > 98% copper content. Blister copper is then casted into intermediary anodes which are further refined into copper cathodes (99.99% pure copper) through an electro-refining process. Cathodes are re-melted and processed into final end user products.

## Everything You Need to Know About Copper Recycling
There are a number of reasons that we use copper recycling instead of mining new copper. One of the main reasons is that it takes about 90% less energy to recycle copper than to mine it. When we use less energy, we are putting less pollution into the air. Mining uses valuable resources, creates a lot of pollution, and it costs a lot more money.

## Recycling
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.
