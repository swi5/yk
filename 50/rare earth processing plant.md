## Proposed Operations - Rare Element Resources
The PUG Plant is designed to remove barren rock from the ore and thereby increase the concentration of the rare earth minerals, producing a mineral pre-concentrate. The PUG process employs a series of crushing, washing, screening, and magnetic sorting methods to concentrate the rare earth-bearing fines and reduce the associated physical mass.

This method is used by all rare-earth producers to separate mixtures into the individual elements with purities ranging from 95 to 99.9 percent. The ion-exchange process is much slower, but higher purities of more than 99.99999 percent (i.e., 5 nines or better) can be attained. For optical and phosphor-grade materials, where purities of 5 to 6
