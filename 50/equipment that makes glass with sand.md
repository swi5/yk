## Sand vs Glass Pool Filter Media, Which is Better?
Sand will filter to roughly 30 microns. Some glass media manufacturers state that the glass will filter down to 5 - 10 microns which is less than a cartridge filter. We aren't sure about those claims, however it does filter better than sand as the sand is negatively charged and allow smaller particles to cling better than the sand.
