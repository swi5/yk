The discharge from the tube mill is first passed through a 4-mesh screen to separate out coarse material, which is laundered direct to the classifier. The remainder of the pulp, diluted to give a W/S ratio of 1/1, passes to a Denver " Sub-A" Flotation Cell, from which 60% of the gold and silver in the feed is removed as a concentrate.

## Silver Ore - The Mining Processes that Transform Ore into Bullion 
The first stage of mining silver involves the crushing the silver ore to about 1-1.5in diameter so as to make the ore porous for the extraction process. Once the ore is crushed it is then mixed with lime (about 3-5 lb. per ton) to create a conducive alkaline conditions for the extractions. The ore is then stacked onto impermeable pads made of
