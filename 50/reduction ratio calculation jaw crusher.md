A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications. Fine liner

TYPES OF CRUSHERS As stone passes through a crusher, the reduction in size may be expressed as reduction ratio. The reduction ratio is the ratio of crusher feed size to product size. The sizes are usually defined as the 80% passing size of the cumulative size distribution. For jaw crusher, the ratio can be estimated by the gape. CHAPTER 14.

## reduction ratio calculation crusher|Mining and Rock Technology
May 13, 2019 Setting jaw crushers. Ideally, the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6-to-1. There are different ways to calculate reduction ratio, but the best way is something called the P80 factor. The reduction ratio is then calculated by comparing the input feed size passing 80 percent versus the discharge size that passes 80 percent.
