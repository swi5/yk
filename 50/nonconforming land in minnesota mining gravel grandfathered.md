## Legal Non-Conforming Property Use | Colorado Springs
Sometime you may come across the term, "legal nonconforming" when researching a property or trying to obtain a building permit. Some people refer to the legal non-conforming status as "grandfathered," which can be misleading. The City Code of Colorado Springs refers to two types of legal non-conforming: (1) uses and (2) structures.

Yes, municipalities may regulate a nonconforming use as long as they do not unreasonably interfere with the right to continue the use. They may prohibit (1) the expansion of a nonconforming use and (2) reestablishment of a nonconforming use after it is abandoned (9B Conn.

## Nonconforming use
Nonconforming use in urban planning is a type of zoning variance where a parcel of land may be given an exception from current zoning ordinances due to improvements made by a prior owner or before the current zoning ordinances made the desired use non-conforming under local law. Secondary suites are commonly permitted as a non-conforming use in the zoning district they are located in because

So long as a nonconforming use is allowed to continue in existence, the property owner will typically not oppose this approach.

## Legal nonconforming rights trilogy in Ontario | Gowling WLG
Legal nonconforming rights are one of the most powerful protections afforded to landowners under land use planning law. The concept provides that, simply put, zoning by-laws cannot apply retroactively. If a use of land, a building, or a structure was legal on Monday, a zoning by-law passed that day cannot render it illegal by Tuesday.

## gravel crusher quarry vauation manual
Crusher. A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

A person who asserts that something exists has the burden of proving that it exists. This is especially true of nonconforming rights. The burden of proof is on the property owner.

A grandfather use can lapse if the property owner fails to take advantage of it over time.
