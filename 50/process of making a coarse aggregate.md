Aggregates make up some 60 -80% of the concrete mix. Fine Aggregate Vs Coarse Aggregate-Fine aggregates generally consist of natural sand or crushed stone with most particles passing through a 3/8-inch sieve. Coarse aggregates are any particles greater than 0.19 inch, but generally range between 3/8 and 1.5 inches in diameter.
