The Copperton Concentrator produces bulk concentrate which consists of copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver, among other metals. The molybdenum concentrate is separated from the bulk concentrate using differential flotation. Currently, KUCC sends the molybdenum concentrate to foreign roasters to produce molybdenum trioxide (MoO3).

## How Is Molybdenum Mined and Processed? - Refractory Metals and Alloys
Molybdenum Processing. 1. Grinding. A grinding machine crushes rocks the size of footballs to the size of gravel, then uses a ball mill to further reduce the material to the size of cosmetic powder. 2. Flotation. In the flotation process, the ground ore/gangue powder is mixed with a liquid reagent and inflated.

## Mineralogical Prediction on the Flotation Behavior of Copper and  - MDPI
This copper-molybdenum (Cu-Mo) sulfide ore is generally mined from various locations in the mining site; thus, the mineral composition, oxidation degree, mineral particle size, and grade vary. Therefore, in the mining operation, it is common to blend the ores mined from various spots and then process them using flotation.

## Molybdenite flotation from copper/molybdenum concentrates by ozone 
The bulk copper/molybdenum feed generally varies from 0.2% Mo to 1.0% Mo, and with traditional reagents the single-stage rougher flotation recovery of molybdenite varies between 40% and 90% at a concentrate grade of 5% to 10% Mo. With ozone conditioning for copper depression, however, improved separations appear to be possible, as demonstrated
