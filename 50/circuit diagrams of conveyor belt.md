## Conveyor System : Types, Working, Advantages & Disadvantages - ElProCus
A conveyor system is a mechanical handling apparatus, used to move different goods, loads, and products within the industry. This system reduces manpower, risks at lowers workplace & labor costs. These are very helpful in moving heavy goods from one region to another. This system uses a belt, roller, wheels to transport goods or heavy loads.

These belt conveyors can be run at various inclined angles, typically between 0°- 20° (30° with cleated/chevron belting). For conveyors that operate beyond this incline, steep incline conveyors, which can operate at angles all the way up to 90°, are also available. The diagram below shows the relationship between conveyor center-to-center
