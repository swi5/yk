## Simple Torque Calculation for Belt Conveyor
If I ever need to calculate approximate conveyor power, for example on simple in-plant inclined conveyors, I often do the following simple calculation. Power = t/h x lift x 2.72 x 1.3 kW. From this you can easily calculate the torque, if you have the speed and pulley diameter from the following:

## Conveyor Belt Calculations • Con Belt
The basics of the Calculations of Conveyor Belt Design Parameters. Belt tension: The belt of the conveyor always experience a tensile load due to the rotation of the electric drive, weight of the conveyed materials, and due to the idlers. The belt tension at steady state can be calculated as: Tb = 1.37fLg[2mi+ (2mb + mm)cos (δ)] + (Hg

## Designing Better Conveyors for Bulk Material Handling
The method of conveying the material isn't the only component, though; you also have hoppers, feeders, chutes, separators, reclaimers, and stackers. But the conveyor is the linchpin that determines the rate and efficiency at which the bulk material is moved through the system. Belt conveyors can be the simplest form of a conveyor system.
