## Acid Mine Drainage in South Africa — The International  - Tumblr
The International Network for Acid Prevention (INAP) is an industry group created to help meet the challenge of acid drainage. INAP exists to fill the need for an international body which mobilises acid drainage information and experience. The network was founded in 1998. Since then INAP has become a proactive, global leader in this field.

## Gas Drainage - Mining Science and Technology
Pre drainage of coal seam and surrounding deposits can be carried out by drilling holes from the surface and even prior to the commencement of the mining operations. Holes drilled can be vertical, angled (Ray 2004) or deviated as per need. In seam drilling can also be carried out from the surface by deviated drilling. See figure opposite.

AMD is a byproduct of the mining process (usually from abandoned mines) and is polluting groundwater and waterways world wide and at the same time turning them orange.

Originally, the drainage lines were made from ceramic, "clay," tiles about one foot long and three or four inches in diameter. They were placed end- to-end in a trench, and water entered the tile through the space between adjoining tiles. Concrete tiles replaced some of the clay tiles, and then slotted plastic tubes replaced the tiles.

Mine drainage refers to any surface water or groundwater that drains from an active or abandoned mining operation. Mine drainage can be high-quality similar to natural waters or contaminated by leftover materials. Polluted mine drainage can be extremely acidic and is often laden with high concentrations of toxic, heavy metals.

## Prevention of Acid Mine Drainage Generation From Open-pit Mine  - Us Epa
Exposed, open pit mine highwalls contribute significantly to the production of acid mine drainage (AMD) thus causing environmental concerns upon closure of an operating mine. Available information on the generation of AMD from open-pit mine highwalls is very limited. Most likely, this is due to the difficulty and danger of physically working on or near the face of the highwall.
