## Cone Crusher Explained - saVRee
Cone Crushers; Typically, the initial crushing stage is completed using either gyratory crushers or jaw crushers. It is often the case that there will be only one crusher installed, and this will be referred to as the primary crusher. Cone crushers are more often used for 2nd, 3rd & 4th stage crushing steps (although not always).
