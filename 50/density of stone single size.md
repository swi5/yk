For example, soapstone is on average 3 lbs per square foot MORE than any other stone. However, there won't be quite as much variations between other stones. 3/8″ Tile/1cm Slab = 5-7 lbs per sq/ft 2cm Slab = 10-14 lbs per sq/ft 3cm Slab = 15-21 lbs per sq/ft 3cm Soapstone = 21-24 lbs per sq/ft (Depending on density/thickness)

## Bulk Density Of Aggregates | Loose And Compact Bulk Density 
If a statement is like: A coarse aggregates with higher bulk density, then it means few of the voids can be filled by using fine aggregates and cement. For testing, British Standard (BS 812) has specified the degree of compaction. These are; Loose ( Un-compacted) Compacted; The test will be carried out by using metal cylinder having prescribed depth and diameter and the bulk density is to be

The density of the Σ3 n twin boundaries (BLD Σ3 n, μm −1) was introduced to evaluate the proportion of the annealing twins; this can be calculated using the equation (N p × Δ)/ A, where N p constitutes the number of pixels of Σ3 n twin boundaries, Δ represents the step size in μm, and A represents the scanning area in μm 2.

The density is expressed as a number which indicates how much heavier the gemstone is compared to an equal volume of water. Most gemstone varieties are 2 to 4 times denser than a equal volume of water. But the range is quite wide -- from 8 for cinnabar to 1 for amber. Diamond, at 3.50 to 3.53, falls approximately in the middle.
