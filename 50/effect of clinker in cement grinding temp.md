## What Is Cement Clinker And Clinker Grinding Processing - Gravel Mill
The cement clinker material is crushed by the crusher to the fineness (15mm-50mm) that can enter the mill. The second stage: milling. The crushed small pieces of cement clinker are sent to the storage hopper by the elevator, and then sent to the grinding chamber of the mill evenly and quantitatively by the feeder for grinding.

## Cement Clinker - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Clinker is manufactured from raw materials and then ground into cement. Cement is hydraulically active and will react with water. This reaction is a chemical reaction that will generate heat and CSH gel which gives the set slurry its properties of a low permeability solid with compressive strength.

AM signifies the temperature at which liquid formation starts, the nature of liquid formed and the color of clinker formed. The lowest temperature is obtained at AM equal to 1.6, which is the optimum for clinker formation and nodulization. Higher the AM, lighter the color of clinker (cement).

## cement grinding temperature
Low temperature cement grinding Page 1 of 1. Re: Low temperature cement grinding Hi Gio, Hope this is same Gio I met Natal SA Normally when clinker grinding in verucal mills, the mill outlet temperature is around 8085 deg C only What I feel is try to optimise the dam ring height of the mill to have proper partical size distribution This will help to increase the strength Raj Reply

These are designated by letters in parentheses following the cement type.. Alumina is used for imparting quick setting property to the cement. Also, it acts like flux in reducing the clinkering temperature during the preparation of cement. If alumina is present in excess, then Cement reduces its strength as well.
