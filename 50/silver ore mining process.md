## Silver element extraction methods - Open pit, underground mining techniques
MINING AND PROCESSING : The Silver bearing ores are mined by either open-pit or underground mining methods after which they are crushed and ground. Despite of the existence of other technologies, this metal is mined through a process that uses gravity to break and extract its ores from large deposits.

Mining for Silver. Silver can be mined using open-pit mines or underground mines. As the name suggests, an open-pit mine is a gigantic hole in the ground created using heavy machinery and explosives. Silver miners open the window for open-pit mines when the silver is located close to the Earth's surface.

Ore processing. Once removed from the mine, silver-containing ore is crushed (commutation) into a fine powder to expose individual grains to chemical processing.As a byproduct of mining of lead and copper, silver ores are often purified by froth flotation.After froth flotation, silver is extracted by a cyanide process, akin to technology used for gold extraction.

Finding the metal was only part of the process. After the discovery was made the next step was to bring the ore out of the ground. In the dry Mojave, hard rock miners dug and blasted, sinking shafts and tunnelings into the mountainside. Next, the ore would have to be crushed into a workable size before the metal could be extracted.

Gold and silver are used for jewelry.[1] Mining is the process of removing ore, minerals, metals and gems from the earth. Mining is done through surface or open-pit mining, underground mining or through fluid mining. Open surface mining entails digging out or blasting rocks and creating open-pits in the earth, exposing mineral veins.

The mined ore is crushed and milled before the flotation process to desired grain size. Crushing is done in two phases followed by milling in the bar and ball mills. The flotation process is conducted in the stages. The first stage is the silver-gold-lead flotation which is followed by the zinc-silver flotation and pyrite flotation stages.
