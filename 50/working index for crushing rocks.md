## Bond Impact Crushing Work Index -Procedure and Table of Crushability
The test determines the Bond Impact Work Index which is used with Bond's Third Theory of Comminution to calculate net power requirements when sizing crushers. It is also used to determine the required open-side settings (jaw crushers and gyratory crushers) or closed-side settings (cone crushers) for a given product size.P80 = 25400 x Oss x (0.04Wi + 0.40)

The three rock types do show a mild correlation between crushing Work Index and UCS (R² values between 0.1 and 0.4). Unfortunately, the correlation observed does not make sense: the correlation is expected to be positive (increasing towards the right) rather than negative (decreasing towards the right).

If you used that motor to do work to 2 tonnes of rock you would have used 20kWh ÷ 2 tonne, 10kWt/h. The higher the Work Index, the more work required to break the rock, hence the harder the rock. Crushing or Impact Work Indices are measured in the laboratory using a special impact strength-testing machine.

## Working Index For Crushing Rocks
As a basic rule, impact crushing is suitable for rocks with a low work index (12) as well as low silica (20%) and moisture levels (5%). Rocks with these characteristics are soft and non-abrasive, and easily broken within the crushing chamber, keeping wear rates at a minimum, and producing high reduction ratios with a better-shaped end product.
