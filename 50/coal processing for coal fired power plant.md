##  Dust Explosion Protection Coal Fired Power Plant in Gdansk
eral hard coal-fired power plants in Poland. The hazard of hard coal dust in mining has been well known for years. In the power plants, the hard coal is transported to the furnaces on long conveyor belts (Fig-ures 2 and 3). The coal is largely so coarse-grained that there is no immediate risk of dust explosion. However, unavoidable abrasion

## Coal Fired Power - Improve Productivity & Safety - Martin Eng
A power plant's coal-handling system starts with a reclaim conveyor under the stockpile and makes its way to the coal gallery. There, twelve conveyors distribute the coal to six different bunkers that feed the plant's three coal-fired boilers. The plant suffered general dust, spillage and carryback problems throughout the coal conveying system.
