## What Is High Phosphorus Fertilizer | When To Use It - TheYardandGarden
When grown in fertile soil, a balanced NPK (ie. fertilizer) works well. In phosphorus-deficient potting soil, a NPK can help to balance out any nutritional shortages. Flowering plants like African violets, begonias, and bromeliads use phosphorus to form lots of lovely flowers.

All animals require sodium, but some plants do not. Plants need boron and silicon, but animals may not (or may need ultra-small amounts). Just six elements—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium, and phosphorus—make up almost 99% of the mass of a human body (see composition of the human body for a complete list).
