## The PCB Recycling Process in Design and Electronics Production
Recycling a PCB recovers the precious metals and components, and turns the trash into treasure. PCB recycling begins with the physical process of drilling/sorting the boards to remove components, and then cutting the boards into smaller chunks. This process removes capacitors, motors, batteries, plugs, semiconductors, LEDs, fasteners, and other

## Can Printed Circuit Boards Be Reused or Recycled? - Newbury Electronics
Recycling a Populated Printed Circuit Board. Scrap bare PCBs (i.e. unpopulated PCBs) contain small amounts of copper that can be recycled. The amount of gold, silver, or tin in them is usually tiny. The FR4 epoxy glass laminate which makes up the bulk of the bare PCB cannot be recycled back to its constituents.

## How to Recycle Printed Circuit Boards | MCL
Recycling Copper From the Spent Tin/Lead Stripping Solution From the Solder Stripping Process: Following the etching process, remove the protective solder plate to expose the copper connections. Strip the tin and lead from the solder plate by immersing the printed circuit board in nitric acid or a hydrogen fluoride stripping solution.
