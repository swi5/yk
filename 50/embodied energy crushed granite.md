##  DRAFT of Embodied Energy and Global Materials - EDGE Buildings
The embodied energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to construction are a large contributor to annual global emissions. They are estimated at 5% to 10% of the entire energy consumption in developed countries and 10% to 30% in developing countries (IEA, 2016). Although important, information on embodied energy in construction

## Embodied Energy of Materials — Paul McAlister Architects
Key Principles in assessing embodied energy of materials. The energy consumed in producing, transporting, installing, maintaining and disposing of construction materials and products represents between 10% and 25% of the total lifetime energy consumption of a typical building. However, for low-energy buildings this figure can be as high as 50%.

What is embodied energy of concrete? The total energy intensity for concrete is calculated to be 11.01 MJ/€. Using the same assumptions as above this is converted to relevant units. The resultant total embodied energy, EE of concrete is calculated to be 0.298 MJ/kg. Consequently, the indirect EE of concrete is found to be 0.097 MJ/kg.
