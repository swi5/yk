## Conveyor Tail And Drive Pulleys - Belt Conveyor Propulsion - Cisco-Eagle
The tail pulley is located at the tail end of the conveyor and it turns freely. Now a "belt" can be put around the pulleys. The Drive Pulley turns and moves the belt around (and around, and around). But it is dangerous to have the belt hang down under the conveyor bed. So small rollers are put into the Conveyor Bed to hold up the belt.

800~1600. A conveyor pulley is a mechanical device similar to a conveyor roller that is used to change the direction of the belt in a conveyor system or to drive the belt or to put tension on the belt. A conveyor pulley is more heavy-duty than a roller and is used at either end of a conveyor, or near the drive/motor.

Determine the face length of the conveyor pulley: The face length of a conveyor pulley is a derivative of the conveyor belt width. In bulk-handling applications, an adequate pulley face length is one that is 2 or 3 inches greater overall or 1 to 1.5 inches greater on each end than the overall width of the conveyor belt.
