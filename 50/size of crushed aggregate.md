With most particles going through a 3/8-inch sieve, fine aggregates typically consist of natural sand or crushed stone. All particles larger than 0.19 inches are coarse aggregates but usually vary between 3/8 and 1.5 inches in diameter. Gravels make up much of the remaining coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone.

Gravel is a loose mixture of rock fragments formed as a result of erosion. Gravel, along with other types of rock fragments such as sand and crushed stone, is commonly used for construction purposes, though it has other uses as well. Rock fragments are typically classified based on the size of the individual pieces that make up the aggregate.

Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. After harvesting, aggregate is processed: crushed, screened, and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.

## Aggregate | Washington Asphalt Pavement Association
Aggregate. "Aggregate" is a collective term for sand, gravel and crushed stone mineral materials in their natural or processed state (NSSGA 1991). In 2009, the U.S. produced nearly 2 billion tons of aggregate at a value of about $17.2 billion. Roads and highways constitute31 percent of the total sand, stone and gravel market (NSSGA 2010).
