## Hydrated lime in water treatment
As mentioned above, lime /calcium hydroxide slurry is the primary vehicle for adding lime to water treatment processes. But when it comes to sourcing it, there are a number of options. You can make it onsite, using either quicklime or hydrated lime, or you can buy a ready-mixed lime /calcium hydroxide slurry, such as CALSAFE from Carmeuse.

## Lime Requirements | American Agricultural Laboratory
Summary. Lime is used to increase soil pH to optimal levels (6.0-6.8) for plant growth. Lime recommendations are given when soil pH values drop below critical thresholds that cause expected yield reduction. Critical thresholds vary by crop tolerance such that lime is recommended for legumes at pH<6.0 and grasses at pH<5.3.

For water treatment purposes, high-calcium or calcium lime only is used. Hydrated lime, Ca(OH) 2, is a dry powder and is produced by adding sufficient water to quicklime to combine chemically with its calcium oxide content to produce calcium hydroxide: CaO + H 2 O = Ca(OH) 2.
