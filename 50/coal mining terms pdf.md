Surface mining is used to produce most of the coal in the U.S. because it is less expensive than underground mining. Surface mining can be used when the coal is buried less than 200 feet underground.

Coal use in the United States began around 2,000 years ago. Early inhabitants of this continent probably gathered coal from outcroppings, beaches, and streambeds. Coal mining by European-Americans began in Virginia, in the Richmond Basin, between 1720 and 1750. The Richmond area is known to have furnished coal during the American Revolution.
