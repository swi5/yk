## A Decision Support System for Underground Mining Method Selection
In reality, UMMS is one of the Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems and decision makers have some difficulties in making the right decision in the multiple criteria environment. In this paper, a decision support system for underground mining method selection (UMMS-DSS) has been designed and developed in order to take into account
