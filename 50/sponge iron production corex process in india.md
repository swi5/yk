Another case may be cited of sponge iron production. In case of rotary kiln, the coal used as energy source and reductant contaminates the sponge iron by ash and sulphur but when it is reduced in shaft or retort using gas as reductant and heat source, the sponge produce is free from such contamination and is rated as high quality sponge iron.

## Sponge Iron Production Process - Arij Trading
Market share: About 23% of sponge iron total production. 4) Tunnel furnace process This process is the oldest direct reduction method. In this method, Thermal coal is mixed with iron ore as a reducing agent. Natural gas generates the required reduction temperature, and reduction is performed on Silicon Carbide (SiC) Crucibles in a tunnel furnace.

Overview. India is world's largest producer of sponge iron produced through direct reduction of iron-ore / iron pellet in the solid state. Since the higher grade domestic lumpy ore will be exhausted in the next 10 years and value additions to the Iron Ore Fines by various processes such as Pelletisation is the need of present scenario which will be economically beneficial in the long run.

JSW Steel is the first Indian Company to use the Corex technology to produce hot metal. We went for this technology although it was untested in Indian conditions due to its benefits to the environment. Corex is a smelting-reduction process developed by VAI, for cost-efficient and environmentally friendly production of hot metal from iron ore and low grade coal.
