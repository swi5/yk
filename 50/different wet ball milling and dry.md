While dry milling is less capital intensive, it also yields less ethanol per bushel of corn than wet milling (Rajagopalan, et al., 2005). Wet milling involves steeping the corn for up to 48 hours to assist in separating the parts of the corn kernel. Processing the slurry separates the germ from the rest of the kernel, which is processed further

## Wet Milling vs. Dry Milling in the Pharmaceutical Industry
Milling is used across a number of different industries and can be broadly divided into two types: wet milling and dry milling. When it comes to the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, the particle size of ingredients is critical to a drug's performance and efficacy, so the stakes are much higher than when milling foods or other consumer goods.

## Dry milling and fractionation of grain
Dry milling of grain is mainly utilized to manufacture feedstock into consumer and industrial based products. This process is widely associated with the development of new bio-based associated by-products. The milling process separates the grain into four distinct physical components: the germ, flour, fine grits, and coarse grits.The separated materials are then reduced into food products
