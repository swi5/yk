The first question is how far current metals production is stretched and whether existing reserves can provide for the energy transition.

## Not So "Green" Technology: The Complicated Legacy of Rare Earth Mining
Aug 12, 2021For every ton of rare earth produced, the mining process yields 13kg of dust, 9,600-12,000 cubic meters of waste gas, 75 cubic meters of wastewater, and one ton of radioactive residue. This stems from the fact that rare earth element ores have metals that, when mixed with leaching pond chemicals, contaminate air, water, and soil.

The REEs were first commercialized during the 1880s, when rare-earth oxide mixtures were used to make incandescent mantles for gas lights. The REEs were extracted from monazite mined from coastal heavy-mineral placer deposits in Brazil and India. Similar mixtures found applications in steel making.

Introduction to Rare earth elements. The global demand for rare earth elements is growing. Australia is the 4 th largest producer of rare earths in the world, and it holds 3.4% of the worlds rare earth resources. As critical minerals, rare earths elements processing is a new industry, which makes rare earth projects riskier compared to lithium projects which have a well-documented history.
