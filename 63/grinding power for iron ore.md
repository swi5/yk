Raymond mill is an earlier and commonly used milling machine. It can grind limestone with Mohs hardness ≤9.3 and humidity ＜6%. The final calcium carbonate powder fineness of Raymond mill ranges from 80 - 325 mesh, which can meet the fineness requirements of limestone powder in most industries. In addition, with the development of technology

## Damp Mill - Ball Grinding Machine | Iron Ore Pelletizing Equipment
It has three main features: forced feeding, peripheral discharging, and rubber lining. As the main equipment in iron ore pelletizing plants, a damp mill is mainly used for the damp grinding of iron ore to provide materials for the pelletizing disc. It can deal with the iron ore with a water content of 8-13%, not only increase the surface area

## Fine Dry Grinding of Iron Ore for Pelletizing
When dry grinding is selected the moisture required for pelletizing must be provided either by wetting the ore and mixing prior to balling or by adding all the moisture in the balling device. To date only the balling disc has operated with a dry feed. Based on power consumed per ton of final product, generally the power consumption in the
