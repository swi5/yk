Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes. The leakage of chemicals from mining sites can also have detrimental effects on the health of the population living at or around the mining site.

Respirable coal mine dust is a hazard in underground and surface coal mines and in coal-processing facilities. It is a mixed dust, consisting mostly of coal, but can also include silica, clay, limestone and other mineral dusts. The composition of coal mine dust varies with the coal seam, the composition of the surrounding strata and mining methods.

Coal may have any or all of the following hazards: Coal is very liable to spontaneus heating. Freshly mixed coal absorbs oxygen, forming peroxides which break up into carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. This is an exothermic reaction and the heat produced causes further oxidation and more heat. Co (carbon monoxide) has a large flammable range
