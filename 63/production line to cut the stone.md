Quarries and stone manufacturers use diamond-wire cutters for precise and clean cutting of stone slabs. The wire is extremely long and runs from a motorized spool, attached to a vehicle on a track. The process is similar to that of someone slicing through a piece of cheese. However, the harder the stone, the more difficult it will be to make a cut.
