Jackpot Mining Company operates a copper mine in central Montana. The company paid $1,000,000 in 2016 for the mining site and spent an additional $600,000 to prepare the mine for extraction of the copper. After the copper is extracted in approximately four years, the company is required to restore the land to its original condition, including repaving of roads and replacing a greenbelt.

## Why We Need Full-Cost Accounting for Aggregate Mining - Reduce Flooding
However, in the late 1990's and early 2000's, the cost of building new reservoirs in California was approximately $3,000/acre foot, while the cost of mechanically removing sediment from old reservoirs was $20,000/acre foot, almost 7X more. "The economic value of avoiding further reservoir capacity loss could be a significant factor making

## Copper mining costs fell for the third consecutive year | CRU
Despite the copper mining industry's improved cost position in 2016, weak copper prices, especially in the first three quarters of the year, constituted an ever-present threat to the higher cost producers. Our data indicates that at the average 2016 LME Cash copper price of $4,862/t, approximately 11% of copper mine capacity was cashflow negative.

Place the device against the side of your finger and press the plunger. Use a different finger each time and a different area. Take your meter with the test strip and hold it against the drop of blood. It'll tell you if the test strip is filled, usually by beeping. Before you look at.
