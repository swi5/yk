## Major brazilian gold deposits - 1982 to 1999 - USGS
The discovery of alluvial deposits in the Amazon by garimpeiros in the 1970s and the opening of eight mines by mining companies from 1983 to 1990 fueled a major boom in Brazil's gold production, exceeding 100 t/year in 1988 and 1989. However, garimpeiro alluvial production decreased 'rapidly in the 1990s, to about 10 t/year by 1999.

## Alluvial and Placer Mineral Deposits | Geology for Investors
Technically a placer deposit is the general term for a mineral deposit formed by the concentration of moving particles by gravity. Alluvial is the name for placer deposits formed by water action in a stream or river.

Alluvial mining is done in sedimentary. deposits. Mining methods are chosen on the. basis of the lithological characteristics of the. deposits. Grade of deposit is generally low, hence, all. methods are comparatively less expensive. Mining projects involving alluvial mining have. generally low capital investments.
