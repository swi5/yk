## Copper Ore - Official Satisfactory Wiki
Copper Ore is a common resource found in the world. It is smelted into Copper Ingots for further processing. Copper Ore can be harvested by hand (default E) in trace amounts from resource deposits scattered across the world, or from inexhaustible resource nodes on which Miners can be constructed to extract automatically. Additonally, Lizard Doggos will ocassionally bring it when tamed. Items

## Turning Copper Ore into Copper: What are the Processes?
After the air is brought up through the water, bubbles form that float the water-repellent copper particles to the surface of the water. This separates out the froth which has 30% copper, 27% iron, and 33% sulfur. The flotation process gets rid of impurities in the ore, where there may also be lead and other vital metals in our society such as

## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

The San Manuel Copper Mine was a surface and underground porphyry copper mine located in San Manuel, Pinal County, Arizona. Frank Schultz was the original discoverer, in 1879, but the main body of the deposits were discovered by Henry W. Nichols in 1942. The exploration drilling went on from 1943 to 1948, with the first mine shaft built 1948.
