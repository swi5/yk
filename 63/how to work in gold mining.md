If the mine is good, it will more than pay for itself as you go along: Start with an open-pit mine. Start digging downward and expand the edges of your pit as you go. If you're striking a lot of gold, hire a few more workers and expand more. If you're still bringing in a lot of ore, rent a few machines to help you dig.

Next, blasting occurs to break down the rock making it easier to move. A fleet of excavators mine designated ore areas and move the gold containing ore to stockpiles. The stockpiles containing the ore will be processed to extract the gold. Trucks move waste to a waste rock stack, which can be rehabilitated to fill previously mined areas.

## Mercury Usage in Gold Mining and Why It Is a Problem - ThoughtCo
How Mercury Is Used in Gold Mining . First, mercury is mixed with the materials containing gold. A mercury-gold amalgam then is formed because gold will dissolve in the mercury while other impurities will not. The mixture of gold and mercury is then heated to a temperature that will vaporize the mercury, leaving behind the gold.

## Mining 101: Ultimate List of Gold Mining Equipment
Since the beginning of civilization, humans have mined around 6 billions troy ounces of gold. Today, 2.5 percent of all gold production happens in Nevada, making it one of the primary regions on earth.

## How Gold Sluices Work - Manhattan Gold & Silver
In the lab, this process is called "gravity separation.". Sluice boxes are designed to mimic this naturally occurring gravity separation. As water carries gold-laden sediment through the box, small obstructions called riffles block the free flow of material. These tiny flow restrictions form low pressure pockets where the gold collects.
