## Thena-travel
The mechanical maintenance training courses begins by providing the candidates with an understanding of fault diagnosis by analysing various symptoms. These symptoms include excessive heat, vibration, smell or changes in speed. The aim is to make the candidate aware of the possible outcomes if action is not taken once a fault has been discovered. 787 Practical Training Task List (PDF) Goals.

## Vibrating Screen Working Principle - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The simplest Vibrating Screen Working Principle can be explained using the single deck screen and put it onto an inclined frame. The frame is mounted on springs. The vibration is generated from an unbalanced flywheel. A very erratic motion is developed when this wheel is rotated.
