## Iron in Drinking Water (Here's What to Do About It!) - Home Water Research
Dissolved iron is a natural contaminant found in water supplies. While most iron is in the form of ferric iron (Fe3+), which is not very soluble, some of it may be present as ferrous iron (Fe2+) .  A study in India found that drinking water with high iron levels caused iron accumulation in the skin and nails . While no negative health impact

## Ferrous metallurgy
Ferrous metallurgy is the metallurgy of iron and its alloys.The earliest surviving prehistoric iron artifacts, from the 4th millennium BC in Egypt, were made from meteoritic iron-nickel. It is not known when or where the smelting of iron from ores began, but by the end of the 2nd millennium BC iron was being produced from iron ores in the region from Greece to India, and Sub-Saharan Africa.
