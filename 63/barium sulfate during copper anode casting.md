## Tellurium cation or anionert-durch-elf
Ions are identified by a superscript that shows the sign and size of the electric charge - for example Ca +2. There are two types of ions: cations and anions . A cation has a net positive electrical charge, which means it has more protons than electrons. An anion has a net negative electrical charge, which means it has more electrons than protons.

Sep 24, 2021Earlier research of the phenomena related to nickel in the context of copper electrorefining has focused on its effects on the anode and within the electrolyte. A majority of the nickel dissolves into the electrolyte, increasing the resistivity of the electrolyte. Consequently, this increases the electricity consumption of the process [ 2, 5 ].

## Study the failure of casted copper anode: The formation of bumps 
Aug 1, 2022Copper anode (âˆ¼98%) is widely used to produce the cathode (99.995 wt%) in electrorefining process. These anodes sometimes become problematic from the production line due to the presence of bumps/holes on their surface. To find the reason of this defect, chemical composition of the three casted anodes was determined by the quantmeter analysis.

## barium sulfate during copper anode casting
Copper industry. As barium sulfate has a high melting point and is insoluble in water, it is used as a release material in the casting copper anode plates. The anode plates are cast in copper molds, so to avoid the contact of the liquid copper and the solid copper mold, a solution of barium sulfate in water is used as a coating on the mold surface.

## Tellurium, from Copper Anode Slime to High Purity Product: A Review 
Oct 6, 2020The slime is continuously formed during the electrorefining of copper. Insoluble elements and compounds fall into the bottom of the electrorefining tank as well as a substantial amount of barium sulfate (BaSO 4), which is used as a lubricating mold wash during the anode casting
