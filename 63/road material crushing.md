Eco-friendliness is another big benefit of crushed concrete. Using this material helps slow down the production of new concrete and also frees up space in landfills. It prevents demolished concrete from sitting around taking up space and puts it to good use. Depending on how you have it installed, it's also rather permeable.

## Recycling of road materials in new unbound road layers - ResearchGate
A literature review indicates that the use of RAP and its mixtures with natural aggregate in a pavement unbound base layer is a valuable alternative [17,11,28,26,24,1,31,18].

## Numerical Evaluation of Crushing Resistance of Unbound Road Material 
Adequate description and measurement of unbound materials resistance to aggregate crushing is an issue, in terms of the measured response coupled to intrinsic properties of the aggregates and unbound materials gradation. In this study, a new Discrete Element Method (DEM)â€”based model is developed to investigate aggregate damage in unbound road
