gold and gravel aquifers. Aquifer Wikipedia. An aquifer is an underground layer of waterbearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt). Groundwater can be extracted using a water well.The study of water flow in aquifers and the characterization of aquifers is called hydrogeology.Related terms include

This disparity between recharge rates and groundwater losses led to water level declines during, ranging from 0.6 to more than 21 feet in many major Oklahoma aquifers, as shown in Figure 1.

## What Sediments Create a Good Aquifer?
