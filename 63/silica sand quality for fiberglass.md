## Silica, Crystalline - Overview | Occupational Safety and Health 
Crystalline silica is a common mineral found in the earth's crust. Materials like sand, stone, concrete, and mortar contain crystalline silica. It is also used to make products such as glass, pottery, ceramics, bricks, and artificial stone. Respirable crystalline silica - very small particles at least 100 times smaller than ordinary sand you
