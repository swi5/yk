## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Cement Concrete
Concept and significance of the Aggregate crushing value test. The ' aggregate crushing value test ` gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. Aggregate crushing value is defined as the percentage by weight of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under

## How to Find Aggregate Crushing Value and Its Test Procedure?
Aggregate Crushing Value and Its Test Procedure: One of the test in which concrete material can fail is due to crushing under compressive stress. Aggregate crushing test is standardized by IS: 2386 part-IV and used to verify the crushing strength of aggregates. The aggregates should be oven dried, which can passes through 12.5mm and retained on
