## Solid Mineral in Nigeria [Guidelines On Exploring, Mining  - Nairaland
Exploration is so expensive. I have been to many gold mines centers in Nigeria, and what I have seen so far are death traps. Avoid death traps! I prefer alluvial gold mining on surface land. Honestly, if anyone can get such spots, that will be so great. And a good strategy to explore gold there on a small scale can be formulated.

In Nigeria, all activities regarding gold, from manufacturing to exploration, resource extraction, and refining, were largely sizable in 1913, with its peak production in the early 1930s. Sadly, due to World War 2 in 1939, gold output in Nigeria plummeted a few years after encouraging mining, exploration, and production.
