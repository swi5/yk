## Use These Construction Materials To Build A Green Home
Thus, the existing material is now recycled. The recycling process, when compared to the production, consumes 75 per cent less energy. Along with this, using recycled steel frees up the landfill space used by the scrap metal. Straw bale . Straw bale is one of the most effective green building construction material.

The proportions of the bed are important. A short bed doesn't need to be as deep, a 3 foot by 8 foot bed will look right at home. A longer bed will need more depth, if possible. A 12 foot by 100 foot bed will look proportional. Most home gardens are more likely to have beds that fall between 5 and 50 feet long.
