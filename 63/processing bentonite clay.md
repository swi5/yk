## EPA4 - Process for producing bentonite clays exhibiting  - Google
A process for upgrading a crude bentonite ore such that it can be used advantageously to prepare unusually high aqueous solution viscosities. This sequence comprises initially subjecting the crude ore to a working or shearing stage, followed by a drying step to about a 5 % moisture level. Na2CO3 is then dry-blended with the material, and the sequence is completed by subjecting the mix to a

## Vertical Mill For Bentonite Clay Processing
The moisture of bentonite into the mill is usually 10%-18% (moisture after drying) or even higher. Hot air in the grinding process can effectively solve the problem of grinding efficiency.
