The method. Three substances are needed to enable to extraction of iron from its ore. The combined mixture is called the charge:. Iron ore, haematite - often contains sand with iron oxide, Fe 2 O 3.. Limestone (calcium carbonate).. Coke - mainly carbon.. The charge is placed a giant chimney called a blast furnace. The blast furnace is around 30 metres high and lined with fireproof bricks.

## Extraction of Iron |authorSTREAM
What is a Blast Furnace? The purpose of a blast furnace is to reduce and convert iron oxides into liquid iron called "hot metal". The blast furnace is a huge, steel stack lined with refractory brick. Iron ore, coke and limestone are put into the top, and preheated air is blown into the bottom.

## Why is haematite added to the blast furnace?145
Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide, Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

At the bottom of the furnace the iron ore is chemically reduced. The blast reacts with the coke; carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are formed at temperatures of up to 2000 °C. The carbon monoxide removes the oxygen from the iron ore resulting in pig iron production. Slag is formed from the other ore components and the additions.

##  4 Extraction of Iron in a Blast Furnace - King's General Science
This is done in a blast furnace. The most common ore of iron is called haematite (iron(iii) oxide). Its formula is Fe 2 O 3. Haematite is added to the top of the furnace along with coke (i.e. carbon) and limestone. Three reactions take place during this extraction. Firstly, the carbon in the blast furnace burns with the hot air to form carbon
