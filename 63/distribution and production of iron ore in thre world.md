## distribution of iron ore
Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.
