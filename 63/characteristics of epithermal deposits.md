## Geological characteristics of epithermal precious and base metal deposits
Epithermal deposits are important sources of gold and silver that form at 20 wt percent NaCl equiv for Ag-Pb-Zn deposits. Stable isotope data indicate that hydrothermal solutions were composed mostly of deeply circulated meteoric water, with a nil to small and variable component of magmatic water. Epithermal deposits associated with quartz + alunite ± pyrophyllite ± dickite ± kaolinite

## Characteristics that distinguish types of epithermal deposits 
Three distinctive groupings of epithermal deposits were recognized from a literature study of fifteen well-described precious- and base-metal epithermal districts, supplemented by L. J. Buchanan's 1981 compilation of data from 47 less completely documented deposits. The three groups are distinguished primarily by the type of alteration and the sulfur fugacity indicated by the vein mineral

Low Sulphidation Epithermal Gold Deposits. Although they are a product of the same igneous system, low sulfidation epithermals gold deposits are very different from high sulfidation. In low sulfidation the main control for Gold deposition, is fluid boiling - caused by a drop in the confining pressures the fluid approaches the surface.

What is an Epithermal Gold-Silver Deposit? Epithermal gold-silver deposits are formed by geothermal fluids circulating in the earth's crust.  The key for any exploration program is to target the geologic characteristics that are favourable for mineralization to form. To gain an undstanding of what these characteristics are, exploration

## What is epithermal gold?pro
Epithermal ore deposits are formed in the crust when the fluids are directed through a structure where the temperature,  Intrusion-related gold deposits refer to an incoherent group of deposits with wide-ranging characteristics produced by local-scale fluids derived from a cooling pluton. IRGS are major, intrusive deposits that most often

The Alliance will focus on generating gold and silver targets considered geologically similar to the recent major gold deposit discovery at Silicon in the Walker Lane trend in Nevada, USA.  Using our proprietary database we have been targeting areas with similar characteristics to Silicon. The Cuprite epithermal gold project, assembled

## Porphyry copper deposit
Porphyry copper deposits are copper ore bodies that are formed from hydrothermal fluids that originate from a voluminous magma chamber several kilometers below the deposit itself. Predating or associated with those fluids are vertical dikes of porphyritic intrusive rocks from which this deposit type derives its name. In later stages, circulating meteoric fluids may interact with the magmatic
