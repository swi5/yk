## Impacts of Sea Sand Mining (Pros and Cons)
Mining activities are strategic for an area in improving the industrial and economic sectors. Particularly for coastal areas, one of the mining activities is sea sand mining. Similar to river sand mining on land, sea sand mining is carried out around the coast or in the middle of the sea either by using traditional tools or using more modern tools.
