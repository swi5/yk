## Crushers for recycling and rock: What type of crusher is 
In these applications we highly recommend a jaw crusher as the primary crusher, which reduces the rock down to 3-4", and then a cone crusher as the secondary crusher to further reduce down to the desired size. Often times the secondary crusher is not used and the primary crusher conveys into a screening plant which separates the material into

## Type of crushers and their difference - JXSC Mining
What is a crusher? A crusher is a machine that is designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, or rock dust. Crushers may be used to reduce the size of materials, or change the form of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials so that pieces of different composition can be easy for next step separation.
