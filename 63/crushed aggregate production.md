## Crushed Aggregate - LaPrairie Group
Crusher chip is a crushed aggregate, also known as rock aggregate, produced by crushing larger stones in an impact crusher. This type of crushed aggregate has a finer texture than that produced by other types of crushers. The stone aggregate is first broken up in a hammer mill or quarry crusher. Next, the stones are reduced to smaller pieces

Together, crushed stone and sand and gravel amount to approximately half the mining volume in the United States. Crushed stone and sand and gravel are among the top nonfuel mineral commodities in annual U.S. production with a combined value during 1981 of more than $5.4 billion. This by far exceeds iron ore ($3.0 billion),

Crushed stone aggregates are produced by crushing quarried rock, then screening it to sizes appropriate for the intended use. Production of crushed stone has three stages: Primary crushing to break down the stone to a manageable size; secondary and tertiary crushing to render the rocks into sizes specific to their applications; and screening to separate the crushed stone for further processing

Aggregates. Aggregates are of two main types - crushed rock and sand and gravel. Some examples of their use include hard-core for use under concrete slabs and footpaths, infill for roads and drainage stone on farms. In addition aggregates are a key ingredient in the manufacture of ready-mixed concrete and precast concrete products.

## Crushed Concrete Aggregate| Concrete Construction Magazine
Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) refers to crushed concrete and other materials suitable for use as fill and compactible fill.  If too many fine particles are present in the aggregate blend, the material will hold more water than virgin aggregates. Careful production is required. Ozinga Bros. Inc., a ready-mix producer in Chicago, is

## Sustainability in Midwestern Crushed Stone Aggregate Production
During the 19th century, lime and building stone were the main stone products used in the region and the industry was able to convert to crushed stone aggregates after 1900. Since then, both regions have experienced similar increasing production trends that have greatly reduced their long-term reserves of aggregate resources.
