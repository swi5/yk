## MIT students fortify concrete by adding recycled plastic
Concrete is, after water, the second most widely used material on the planet. The manufacturing of concrete generates about 4.5 percent of the world's human-induced carbon dioxide emissions. Replacing even a small portion of concrete with irradiated plastic could thus help reduce the cement industry's global carbon footprint.

Aggregate may be natural, manufactured or recycled. â€¢ Aggregates make up some 60 -80% of the concrete mix. They provide compressive strength and bulk to concrete.

When the mixture gets wet, the cement acts as a paste that holds the rock together and creates extremely strong structures. To make concrete, a manufacturer needs to get the correct mix of cement and rock. According to the Portland Cement Association, the typical combination is 10-15% cement, 60-75% rock, and 15-20% water.

## However,u-putz
However, concrete may crack, heave, or buckle during the cold months. The salt used for melting ice can also smudge, stain, or pit concrete, causing ugly marks.It also takes ice and snow longer to melt when it falls on concrete compared to asphalt.Asphalt Must Be Resealed and Concrete Stains Easily. According to a number of studies of concrete roads vs asphalt roads over the past decade

## Mechanical Behavior of Recycled Fine Aggregate Concrete  - SpringerOpen
This study investigated the mechanical behavior of normal strength (NS) and high strength (HS) concrete containing recycled fine aggregates (RFAs). A high slump mixing design was employed, which may be potentially used as filled structural concrete. The compressive strength, tensile strength, and elastic modulus were measured according to the RFA replacement ratio and curing time. In addition
