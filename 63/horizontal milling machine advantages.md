Nov 5, 2020High Feed Rate. Horizontal CNC mills feed the substrate quickly through the machining center, replacing the need for deep milling passes with lighter cuts and facilitating an overall increase in efficiency and quality. Maintaining a consistently fast feed rate also keeps the workpieces and cutting tools continuously in motion.
