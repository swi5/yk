Dolomite is a common rock-forming mineral. It is a calcium magnesium carbonate with a chemical composition of CaMg (CO 3) 2. It is the primary component of the sedimentary rock known as dolostone and the metamorphic rock known as dolomitic marble. Limestone that contains some dolomite is known as dolomitic limestone.

## Dolomite - Complete Mineral Overview
Dolomite is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of nominally equal parts calcium and magnesium, with the formula CaMg (CO 3) 2. Its chemical formula can be more clearly written as CaCO 3 .MgCO 3. Because of the presence of two various cations, which form regular layers inside dolomite structure, dolomite crystal symmetry is lower than calcite.

## Dolomite lime Fertilizer | Marijuana Growing & Cannabis Forum
Dolomite is a mineral which contains large amounts of calcium and magnesium, which makes it a good fertilizer for nutrient deficient soil. In addition to working as a fertilizer, dolomitic limestone is also useful for soils that are too acidic, or have an abnormally low pH level. Adding dolostone for the purpose of raising the soil s pH level

## dolomite - Uses | Britannica
Dolomite is used as a source of magnesium metal and of magnesia (MgO), which is a constituent of refractory bricks. Dolostone is often used instead of limestone as an aggregate for both cement and bitumen mixes and also as a flux in blast furnaces. The use of dolostone as a flux has increased, especially since environmental contamination has become a widely heeded consideration, because the
