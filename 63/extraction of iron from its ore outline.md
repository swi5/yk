## Lesson Explainer: Extracting Iron | Nagwa
Lesson Explainer: Extracting Iron. In this explainer, we will learn how to describe the extraction of iron from its ore in the blast furnace. Extraction of iron is arguably one of the most important industrial processes on Earth. Iron is used to make steel, which is incredibly important for constructing transport vehicles and large buildings.

## Iron Extraction and Purification / Steel | ChemKey
The molten iron from the bottom of the furnace can be used as cast iron. Cast iron is very runny when it is molten and doesn't shrink much when it solidifies. It is therefore ideal for making castings - hence its name. However, it is very impure, containing about 4% by weight of carbon. This carbon makes it very hard, but also very brittle.

Dec 11, 2021 · What is iron ore? Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.
