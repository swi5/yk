##  Sintering and Pelletisation of Indian Iron Ores
Emission Optimized Sintering (EOS®) for lower costs Iron ore sintering creates substantial off-gas volumes, and treating these in order to meet increasingly stringent environmental standards is expensive. EOS® uses recycling technology to reduce off-gas volumes by 40 to 50 %, resulting in smaller secondary gas treatment systems. This means:

For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely, the straight travelling grate (STG) process and the grate kiln (GK) process. In the STG process, a stationary bed of pellets is transported on an endless travelling grate through the drying, oxidation, sintering and cooling zones.

## Efficient iron sintering process control - Materials Talks
Sintering is one of the iron ore post-processing steps to prepare iron ore fines for a blast furnace (another common process of iron fines agglomeration is pelletizing, but this will be part of another blog). Feed for a sinter plant consists of iron fines, coke, and flux (eg limestone). The feed is placed on a sintering bed, where thermal
