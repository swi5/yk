## Iron Ore: The Backbone of World Industry | Fote Machinery
Jul 20, 2022There are more than 300 kinds of iron-bearing minerals, but only 20 kinds are used as raw iron ores. The most important 4 types of iron ores are magnetic ore, hematite, limonite, and siderite. 1. Magnetite - the best iron ore Magnetite, also called lodestone. It is a natural magnet, hence the name, giving it a distinguishing characteristic.

## Where is siderite found? Explained by FAQ Blog
Iron can be extracted from Hematite, Siderite, and limonite. The carbonate ore of iron is known as Siderite. Siderite is the name of the mineral which is derived from the Greek word sideros which means iron. How do you clean siderite? You could try cold HCl on a waste piece. Cold HCl will remove the goethite but it also may etch the siderite.

Iron ore looks totally different from the pure iron. There are many iron ores underneath the earth; they are called as limonite, hematite, magnetite and siderite. Iron ores contain few other elements along with iron but in smaller quantities. Iron is found in the crust of earth and it is found abundantly.
