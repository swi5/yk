## flotation of stibnite with high lead content
Jun 08, · Stibnite, the antimony sulphide mineral, responds much better to flotation after being activated with lead nitrate. The theory generally accepted on activation is that the activating substance, generally a metallic salt, reacts with the mineral surface to form on it a new surface more favorable to the action of a promoter.

## Activation mechanism of lead ion in the flotation of stibnite-Science 
The flotation of stibnite with Pb2+ as an activator was examined with micro-flotation tests, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was found that at a pH of 6.5, the addition of Pb(NO3)2 notably improved the flotation efficiency of stibnite with butyl xanthate (BX).

## Activation mechanism of lead ion in the flotation of stibnite
Abstract The flotation of stibnite with Pb 2+ as an activator was examined with micro-flotation tests, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was found that at a pH of 6.5, the addition of Pb(NO 3 ) 2 notably improved the flotation efficiency of stibnite with butyl xanthate (BX). At a pH of 6.5, Pb 2+ was the

## Flotation Reagents - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Stibnite, the antimony sulphide mineral, responds much better to flotation after being activated with lead nitrate. The theory generally accepted on activation is that the activating substance, generally a metallic salt, reacts with the mineral surface to form on it a new surface more favorable to the action of a promoter.
