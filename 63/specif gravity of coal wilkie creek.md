In coal-fired power plants coal mills are used to pulverize and dry to coal before it is blown into the power plant furnace. The coal is feed into the coal mill through a central inlet pipe where gravity is used to lead the coal to the bottom of the mill, where the grinding table and some heavy rollers pulverizes the coal to particles.

Coal density is typically less than that of conventional reservoirs and differs from seam to seam based on the given coal rank and purity [2].The bulk density of a coal consists of the matrix and the void space, with the latter being expectedly filled

## Coal analysis
Chemical properties of coal. Coal comes in four main types or ranks: lignite or brown coal, bituminous coal or black coal, anthracite and graphite.Each type of coal has a certain set of physical parameters which are mostly controlled by moisture, volatile content (in terms of aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons) and carbon content..
