## Crushed rock dust as filler material in concrete - ScienceDirect
1. Introduction. In India, the production of cement is about 370 Mt, produced by about 365 minor and 139 major cement companies. It is estimated that about 1.5 t lime stone is required to manufacture 1 t cement and 1 t CO 2 is emitted. If lime stone reserves are consumed at the present rate, they will be exhausted by the next 15-20 years.

The production of nano cement from sand & clinker is performed by mixing mineral supplement additions such as fly ash and slag or silica sand with crushed and grinded clinker or cement [33], [36]. Before processing into the mill which is shown in Fig. 1, the moisture content of the mixture must not exceed 3%.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.
