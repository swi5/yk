NSW has more than 600 derelict mines (many over 100 years old) for which an operator cannot be held responsible. Consequently, the liability for rehabilitation of these mines has reverted to Government. This is a direct historical example of the impact of a lack of Government regulation in this space. 3 NSW Trade & Investment, October 2014.

Measurements of emissions and monitoring of methane are essential for the development of robust emission inventories as described in Chapter 2. Field measurement of emissions from various sectoral sources can provide improved understanding of processes that lead to emissions, which contributes to the development of process-based emission models as well as regional- and urban-scale mitigation

Coal mine methane (CMM) is the term given to the gas trapped in coal seams, which has an approximate chemical composition of 70% methane, 15% carbon dioxide and 15% nitrogen. The gas is released once the seams are mined and can then escape to the atmosphere. Internationally, the UK was the sixth largest producer of coal mine methane in 1990,140
