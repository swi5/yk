## Quarryinges-lifestyle

However, most of these quarries were abandoned at the end of extraction and became dump and later a place of uncontrolled landfills. The number of restored or rehabilitated quarries is limited and this threatens several aspects of the environment, especially, the quality of surface and ground.

## abandoned quarry - Obscure Vermont
A little village of quarry workers was set up around the sheds called Freedleyville, and is now a ghost town. Like much of Vermont cartography of yore, the village is sometimes still labeled on maps, even though the only evidence of the place are skeletons of thick walls in the woods near Emerald Lake that are the ruins of the old marble sheds.

## Quarry | National Geographic Society
A quarry is a place where rocks, sand, or minerals are extracted from the surface of the Earth. A quarry is a type of mine called an open-pit mine, because it is open to the Earth 's surface. Another type of mine, a sub-surface mine, consists of underground tunnels or shafts. The most common purpose of quarries is to extract stone for building
