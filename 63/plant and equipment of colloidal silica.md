Colloidal silicon dioxide Anhydrous is a highly pure, very fine amorphous silicon dioxide having primary particles in the nano-scale range. It is obtained through chemical synthesis using a suitable silicon compound precursor, such as silicon tetrachloride, typically at temperatures >2000 o C. It is for this reason that it is also referred to as "fumed" or "pyrogenic" amorphous silicon

ASTM C09 subcommittee writes colloidal silica standard. The proposed WK53768, New Specification for Colloidal Silica standard will inform concrete practitioners on a supplementary cementitious materialâemerging from the field of nanotechnologyâthat imparts strength and durability characteristics in finished slabs and structures.

## Colloidal Silica: Fundamentals and Applications - 1st Edition - Horaci
In spite of the apparent simplicity of silica's composition and structure, scientists are still investigating fundamental questions regarding the formation, constitution, and behavior of colloidal silica systems. Colloidal Silica: Fundamentals and Applications introduces new information on colloid science related to silica chemistry as well as theoretical and experimental aspects of
