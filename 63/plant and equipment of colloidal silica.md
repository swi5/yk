Colloidal silicas are most often prepared in a multi-step process where an alkali-silicate solution is partially neutralized, leading to the formation of silica nuclei. The subunits of colloidal silica particles are typically in the range of 1 to 5 nm. Whether or not these subunits are joined together depends on the conditions of polymerization

Colloidal silicon dioxide Anhydrous is a highly pure, very fine amorphous silicon dioxide having primary particles in the nano-scale range. It is obtained through chemical synthesis using a suitable silicon compound precursor, such as silicon tetrachloride, typically at temperatures >2000 o C. It is for this reason that it is also referred to as "fumed" or "pyrogenic" amorphous silicon
