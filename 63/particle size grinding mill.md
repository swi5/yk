But I am surprised by the MK4, in order to get similar drawdown times with my V60 I have to grind at 11 to 13 clicks which is insane to me compared to Comandante recommended setting range (18-30 clicks). My espresso grind setting with the MK3 is at 5 clicks while in the MK4 it is between 2-3 clicks. My zero point is when the handle do not fall. Comandante C40 MK4 Nitro Blade - Liquid Amber

## Particle Size Reduction with Lab Mills & Crushers - RETSCH
Laboratory mills work with different particle size reduction principles. Which type of mill is used for a particular particle size reduction task always depends on the breaking properties of the sample material.  This could either be that of a grinding tool, or be represented by other particles. Strain by impact is mainly caused by one-sided

## Estimation of Grinding Time for Desired Particle Size Distribution and 
Ball mills are progressively used to grind the ores for particle size reduction and to liberate valuable minerals from the ores. The grinding of ore is a highly energy-intensive process [1,2,3,4].In this process, the size of the particle obtained depends on the energy consumption of the ball mill.

## Effect of particle size on performance. 3. Grinding pelleting 
Abstract. Three experiments were conducted to study the effect of particle size obtained by grinding wheat and sorghum in a hammer mill (HM) or roller mill (RM) on broiler performance. Broilers were fed a mash diet or crumbles to 4 wk of age, then pellets to 7 wk of age. When fed as a mash, diets produced with RM-ground grain improved performance.

## Grind Consistency and Particle Size - Clive Coffee
When it comes to the grinder, let's look at some of the most important parameters we strive to control: The dose - the amount, as measured by weight, of ground coffee in the portafilter. While a traditional Italian single dose is 7 grams and a double is 14, a typical dose in a modern North American coffee shop will range from 18 to 20 grams

Gates-Gaudin-Schumann Model. [image: ()] The GGS model predicts the cumulative percent passing distribution: Y= cumulative percent passing. x= particle size. k= size parameter. m =distribution parameter. The values of k and m can be determined by linear regression: log y = m log x + k.

## Different Approaches to Grinding Abrasive Materials
The mill does impart some metal to the products, but in some cases it is below the threshold of perceived contamination for that particular product. There is a nice efficiency to the pulverize style of grinding, and the changing of particle sizes is easy. Depending on the mill size, starting particle sizes can be from 2 to ¼ in.
