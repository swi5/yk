Dry Fog Dust Separation ( DFDS) System. They are used to control the fine dust particle Produced during the coal flow. DFDS system uses high pressure of air (about 3-4 bar) and low pressure of water (about 2-3bar),which generates dry fog and being sprayed at the point of dust generation .The spray angle covers 30 to 90 degree.
