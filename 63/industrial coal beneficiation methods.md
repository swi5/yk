## Coal beneficiation technology to reduce hazardous heavy metals in fly 
Aug 15, 2021Coal beneficiation, an industrial process to improve the quality of raw coal by removing ash-bearing components, can be a cost-effective sustainable and clean technology to reduce the emission of hazardous trace metals.  Float and sink test is one of the most widely used methods to examine the response of coal in laboratory-scale due to its

## Coal beneficiation: Policy priorities for India | ORF
The government of India has stipulated that, as of June 2016, power plants of capacity of 100 Megawatt (MW) or above, located 500 to 749 kilometres (km) from coal mine pit-heads must utilise raw, blended, or beneficiated coal with ash content of 34 percent or less. The obligation of meeting this target rests with the coal supplier.
