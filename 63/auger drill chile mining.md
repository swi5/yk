## Drilling Rigs - What Distinguishes Auger Drilling from RAB Drilling, RC 
Diamond drilling is much slower than reverse circulation (RC) drilling due to the hardness of the ground being drilled. Drilling of 1200 to 1800 metres is common and at these depths, ground is mainly hard rock. Diamond drilling rigs need to drill slowly to lengthen the life of drill bits and rods, which are very expensive.

## Auger Mining - MiningInfo - Google
Auger mining is a method for recovering coal by boring into a coal seam at the base of strata exposed by excavation. Normally one of the lowest-cost techniques of mining, it is limited to horizontal or slightly pitched seams that have been exposed by geologic erosion.  An auger removes coal by drilling or cutting horizontally into the coal
