## limestone iron ore cintering plant
Finely-crushed limestone is used as a flux in iron ore sintering. It adjusts the overall chemistry of the iron burden and plays a vital role in the formation of slag in the blast furnace process. Lime-based binders - sometimes including special clays - increase sinter plant productivity.

## High Quality Limestone For Iron Mill Sintering And Puddling
The sintering converts fine-sized raw material, iron ore, coke breeze, limestone, mill scale, and flue dust into an agglomerated product (sinter) at suitable size for charging into the blast furnace. The raw materials are sometimes mixed with water to provide a cohesive matrix and then placed on a travelling grate called the sinter strand.
