## Manganese Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
The Manganese Mining Process. More than 25 million tons of manganese are mined every year. Most manganese mining occurs in open pits. Although there are processes in place to mine manganese nodules in the ocean floor, they cannot complete with land-based mining production. Once the ore is mined, it's transferred to a processing plant for
