Lightweight aggregates (LWA) are defined as construction materials that have a bulk density lower than that of common construction aggregates (Choudhry and Hadley, 2009 ). It is possible to manufacture LWA and ultra LWA from gasification slag and fly ash, according to Choudhry and Hadley (2009) and Sloss (1996).
