Gypsum rock is first mined or quarried, then crushed and ground to a fine powder. It then goes through a process called calcining where heat at 350 degrees is supplied to the gypsum powder which removes 3/4 th of the water molecules. Hemihydrate is the name of calcined gypsum which is then used in gypsum board, gypsum plaster, and other products.

Brief Introduction of Gypsum Powder. The natural gypsum powder includes anhydrous gypsum and CaS04.2H2O, if you want to commercialize the gypsum powder, you should adopt the CaS04.2H2O, after removing part of water by heating, it will become CaS04.1/2 H20. CaS04.1/2 H20 is the final product which you can use it to produce gypsum board other
