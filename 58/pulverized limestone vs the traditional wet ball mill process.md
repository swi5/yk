Experiment: Roller crimper vs. glyphosate chadw May 31, 2021 None C chadw Active Member May 31, 2021 #1 I'm running a little experiment in our largest food plot we planted it to corn and beans from PF. Half we sprayed with glyphosate. The other half, we roller crimped. Gonna see if rollercrimping does as well as chemicals for weed control.

## The process uses a specialized spray gun to apply the fluid
The process traps many small pockets of air between the glass, and these small air pockets result in high thermal insulation properties. Glass wool is produced in rolls or in slabs, with different thermal and mechanical properties.. Concrete was produced by replacing general-purpose cement with 10%, 20% and 30% of recycled glass powder.
