## Metamorphic Rocks - Geology (U.S. National Park Service)
Introduction. Metamorphic rocks form when high temperatures and pressure act on a rock to alter its physical and chemical properties (metamorphism means 'to change form'). These conditions often stretch, twist and fold the rock as it cools. In metamorphic rocks some or all of the minerals in the original rock are replaced, atom by atom, to form

Low-salinity fluids (T > 200°C reduced S, modest CO 2) and high geothermal gradients are common to many gold deposits and provinces. In contrast, host rocks, hosting structures, depth of formation (in the crust during deposition), subsequent metamorphic overprint, alteration mineralogy and isotopic signatures can vary dramatically within

## Three Rocks that Contain Gold - Rock and Mineral Planet
Metamorphic rocks that contain gold may contain less than 1 PPM to up to 20 PPB. I know that does not mean much too many. PPB is parts per billion, and only 20 is pretty small and likely not worth attempting to get at. Or at least it is not cost effective. Most metamorphic rocks that contain gold do not contain even up to 5 PPB.

## Do Metamorphic Rocks Have Fossils? (ANSWERED) - Yes Dirt
The short answer is no, metamorphic rocks do not have fossils. Because these rocks are formed at extremely high heats, and with a lot of pressure, they are not good candidates to host fossils.

Metamorphic rocks. Metamorphic rocks are rocks that have been changed by heat or pressure, or both. Originally, they were either igneous or sedimentary rocks.

In What Rock Formations Can Gold Be Found? Sciencing. Apr 24, 2017· Quartz. . Nastya22/iStock/Getty Images. Gold is most often found in quartz rock. When quartz is found in gold bearings areas, it is possible that gold will be found as well. Quartz may be found as small stones in river beds or in large seams in hillsides.

## 10.2: Metamorphic Rock Identification - Geosciences LibreTexts
Metamorphic rocks (changed rocks) are made when existing rocks are subjected to high temperatures and high pressures for long periods of time. Metamorphism (meta = change, morph = form) happens when molten rock intrudes other rocks and bakes the contact zone where the molten rock touches the preexisting rock.

## How to Identify Metamorphic Rocks: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow
1. Hold the rock to the light and see if it has a shine or shimmer. Metamorphic rocks tend to have more luster than igneous or sedimentary rock. In the light, you should be able to tell whether the rock has an overall shimmery quality to it. [1] Not all metamorphic rocks have luster or shiny grains.

Metamorphic rocks is one of the three rock categories in the rock cycle. Metamorphic rock material has been changed by temperature, pressure, and/or fluids. The rock cycle shows that both igneous and sedimentary rocks can become metamorphic rocks. And metamorphic rocks themselves can be re-metamorphosed. 7.2: Metamorphic Processes.

The Rock Cycle (KS3) | Types of Rock | Metamorphic Rocks. Metamorphic Rocks Metamorphic rocks were once igneous or sedimentary rocks, but have been changed (metamorphosed) as a result of intense heat and/or pressure within the Earth's crust. They are crystalline and often have a "squashed" (foliated or banded) texture.

Metamorphic Rocks. Metamorphic rocks result from the alteration of pre-existing rocks caused by heat and/or pressure produced by plate movements or intrusion of magma within the Earth's crust. Metamorphism can result in recrystallization of existing minerals, the formation of new minerals, and changes in the texture or fabric of a rock.
