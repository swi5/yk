Utility Sand: Also known as fill sand, utility sand is rather coarse in texture and is a mix of white, gray, beige, tan, and brown particles. It's typically used underneath paving stones (e.g., as a base material for concrete) or even to fill holes and trenches. It compacts especially well, despite the fact that it's not processed or washed.

A sub-base is made up from either unbound granular material or cement bound material and goes under the layer of driveway material that you have opted for. The goal of a sub-base is to evenly spread the load placed on top of the surface, and as a result, evenly across the sub-grade (the underlying ground) below it.

Way to go Allied!! This is one of the reasons I use Allied for everything from crushed stones to there. 1 yard is equal to approximately 1.3 tons. Road base is used as a base layer under many projects. It is a mixture of fractured rock, sand, and soils. It is a great material when you need high compaction under patios, concrete, asphalt, pavers

## Base Preparation for Walkways/Driveways - Pepper Landscape Supply
The most common technique is non-open graded base. What this means is that the compacted granular base portion of the job is using a 3â4" Crusher Run Gravel (also called Granular "A"). This is a combination of angular 3â4" stone mixed with fines and when compacted this material creates a solid base for the next step; the bedding course.
