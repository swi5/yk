Data aggregation is any process whereby data is gathered and expressed in a summary form. When data is aggregated, atomic data rows -- typically gathered from multiple sources -- are replaced with totals or summary statistics. Groups of observed aggregates are replaced with summary statistics based on those observations.

What is In-Network Processing 1. In-network processing is a technique employed in sensor database systems whereby the data recorded is processed by the sensor nodes themselves. This is in contrast to the standard approach, which demands that data is routed to a so-called sink computer located outside the sensor network for processing.

The basic idea of Receive Aggregation is that, instead of allowing the network stack to process packets received from the NIC directly, the packets are preprocessed and coalesced into `aggregated' TCP packets, which are then passed on to the network stack for further processing. Multiple `network' TCP packets are aggregated into a single `host .

## When we estimate the cycle time, we usually ignore the time for rapid 
The bit rate of a network depends on the electronics and not the cable, providing that the operating frequency of the network is within the cable's usable bandwidth. Put differently, the cable is simply a pipe. Flow Rate, Throughput,  The cycle time formula is calculated by adding the total process time, inspection time, move time,

## Signaling Packet Aggregation and Compression in SIP Network: Modeling 
In SIP network, we discovered that a large amount of bandwidth and processing time are wasted, only for signaling overheads, which are redundant to each packet. To enhance the capability of the system, and to handle concurrent requests at a time, we proposed a CTMC model for the process of multiple SIP PA and compressing HC parts of packets.
