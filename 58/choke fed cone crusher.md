## Apr 04 Choke In A Cone Crusher
The type of rock crusher selected will play a role in the shape of the rocks generated from crushing, which may affect sorting. For example, jaw crushers and unloaded cone crushers will produce particles that are flat and elongated while impact crushers and choke-fed cone crushers will make more cubic-shaped particles. The creation of fines is

The optimal arrangement for a cone crusher is to choke feed it with a non-segregated feed. This will help the crusher run more smoothly by lowering both power and pressure peaks and improving overall performance. Choke feeding is about maintaining a constantly high level of evenly distributed material in the feed hopper.

A crusher is choke fed when the chamber is full and there is material above to keep it full. This contrasts with regulated feed, where the flow of material to the crusher is throttled in some manner so that the crusher is never completely filled. Aa particle moves from level to level it drops a greater distance with each movement of the mantle.
