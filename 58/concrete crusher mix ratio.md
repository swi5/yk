## Concrete Mix Ratios (Cement, Sand, Gravel) - StructX
Water/cement ratio theory states that for a given combination of materials and as long as workable consistency is obtained, the strength of concrete at a given age depends on the w/c ratio. The lower the w/c ratio, the higher the concrete strength. All materials used for a design including the water quality should be to a high standard.

The water cement ratio and aggregate cement ratio together determine the cement content of the concrete mix. Generally, the cement content itself would not have a direct role on the strength of concrete; if increase in cement content is required to improve the workability of concrete mix for a given water-cement ratio, then compressive strength may increase with the richness of the mix.

## What are the Correct Concrete Mixing Ratios - Ratio Chart
When making your own concrete it's important to use the correct concrete mixing ratios to produce a strong, durable concrete mix. Some basic mixing ratios for concrete are 1:2:3, 1:3:3, 1:2:4. These mixing ratios are based on the proportions of cement : sand : stone in that order. The ratio you use will depend on what psi strength you need.
