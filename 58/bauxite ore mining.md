The bauxite mining industry is booming in Guinea on the back of demand of Chinese, Russian, Gulf and Indian alumina refineries. The bauxite export from Guinea may exceed to over 110 million tons in 2021. Guinea bauxite is the most preferred ore for alumina refineries worldwide thanks to its low reactive silica content and high gibbsitic alumina.

Description. Aluminum is the most widely distributed metal in the earth's crust, with only the nonmetallic elements oxygen and silicon surpassing it in abundance. However, bauxite ore is the only commercially exploited source of aluminum. Although other types of earth, including ordinary clay, contain aluminum, economics favor the use of bauxite.
