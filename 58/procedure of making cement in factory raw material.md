The overall process is responsible for about 8% of global CO 2 emissions, as the cement kiln in which the reaction occurs is typically fired by coal or petroleum coke due to the luminous flame required to heat the kiln by radiant heat transfer.

Methods of Manufacturing Process of Cement. At present Portland Cement is manufactured by two processes, Dry Process, and Wet Process. The main difference between these two methods of manufacturing of cement is that in the dry process, calcareous and argillaceous raw materials are fed into the burning kilns in a perfectly dry state.The first step in making concrete is to prepare the cement.

## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of

This method is called a semi-dry process, which belongs to the cement dry process production. Advantages: as the dry process is to directly feed raw material powder into the rotary kiln for calcination, and the moisture content of raw materials is about 1% - 2%, it saves the heat consumption needed for the moisture evaporation.

## Industrial Raw Quicklime - process of making cement - BMS FACTORIES
Quicklime. Industrial Raw Quicklime Mineral also known as calcium oxide CaO is a term commonly applied to several related materials. Pure lime is calcium oxide CaO formed by "burning" a form of calcium carbonate such as limestone or marble CaCO 3. Calcium oxide is a key ingredient for the process of making cement.
