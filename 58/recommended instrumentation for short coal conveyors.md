## Fire Fighting / Protection for Coal Conveyors?
I don't know what is used but maybe some logical thought will produce ideas. Coal is burning so -. 1) it gives off heat. 2) it gives off CO2. Maybe provide a thermal sensor (s) over the belt to detect burning, or maybe pass the carrying belt through a tunnel provided with CO2 sensors. These would monitor the coal for burning.

## Types of Conveyors in a Thermal Power Plant - Swanton Welding
Belt conveyors help in the transportation of large volumes of coal over long distances. They come with an endless rubber, balata or canvas belt running over pulleys or a pair of end drums, with rollers (idlers) at regular intervals for support. The return idlers that help in the support of the empty belt are plain and fall widely apart.

## Coal conveyors - Commercial product engineering general discussion 
The term incline would be any degree less than 90 degree. Any product moving on any belt conveyor will move. This normally happens because of inconsitancy in the belt path (ie. pulleys, sliders). The reason why we make belt conveyors into a radius shape to start with is to stop the product from moving off of the sides and onto the floor.
