Lead concentrates produced from ore were processed into primary metal at two smelter refineries operated by a company in Missouri. Secondary lead is obtained from scrap lead. Ninety-nine percent of secondary production of lead was produced at 23 plants in the United States, 15 of which had annual capacities of 15,000 tons or more.

Lead ore also is produced at Rosebery in Tasmania, and Elura in New South Wales. Exposed deposits are becoming harder to find in Australia so exploration companies are looking beneath the surface for the deposits of the future. This is a more costly and difficult way to find orebodies but a series of successes have occurred since the late 1970s.

## Zinc smelting
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc. Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals, e.g. iron, because in contrast, zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals, zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost, unless specific

Lead Processing Plant 【Introduction】: The lead minerals in ores are mainly galena, cerussite, and lead alum. The lead sulfide is galena, while the main lead oxide is cerussite. The lead processing technology uses flotation. 【Application】: There are lots kinds of lead minerals, which have flotation differences between each other.

## Ore Processing | OceanaGold - Waihi Operation
Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with water and steel balls.
