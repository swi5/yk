Limestone has a lot of uses in various industries. We cut limestones into bricks, paver, or tiles in the construction industry or pulverize them for cement production. We can also crush limestones and use them as aggregates to mix with cement and sand for different concrete and mortar mixes. Other industries also use limestone, such as manufacturing paper, glass, and even paint.

## Understanding Limestone in Cement - Concrete Construction
The limestone acts as a seed crystal for the cement, better distributing the reaction products and increasing the reactivity of the cement. As there is always unhydrated cement in the concrete, this change will have no real measurable effect on the use of fly ash. The cement might have a reduced water demand, and the coarser cement gradation

## Utilization of sludge from ready-mixed concrete plants as a substitute 
On average, the total limestone content of the sludge is around 11.2%. This mass percentage in the mixture can be explained by considering the limestone coming from a usual concrete formulation (reference concrete, Table 6) produced in the ready-mixed concrete plant. Indeed, considering no gravels in the sludge, a 12.6% content of calcite in

## How is concrete made from limestone? | Shelly Company
It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete. The water, added through a process called hydration, starts the chemical reaction that causes the cement to harden and set, holding all of the ingredients together as concrete. Before the concrete is allowed to harden, the concrete mix must be poured into a mold so that it will
