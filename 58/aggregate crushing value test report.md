## Test on Aggregates, lab tests, fine aggregate test, coarse aggregate 
Aggregate Water Absorption Test. Water absorption gives an idea of strength of aggregate. Aggregates having more water absorption are more porous in nature and are generally considered unsuitable unless they are found to be acceptable based on strength, impact and hardness tests. Water absorption shall not be more than 2% per unit by weight.

## Aggregate Crushing Strength Test - Online CivilForum
The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.

## What is the significance of ten percent fines value in testing sub-base 
The test aims at looking for the forces required to produce 10% of fine values (i.e. weight of fines aggregates/weight of all aggregates = 10%). This test is very similar to Aggregate Crushing Test in which a standard force 400kN is applied and fines material expressed as a percentage of the original mass is the aggregate crushing value.

## aggregate crushing value test
The percentage mass of fines (passing a 2.80mm BS test sieve) formed in the test is known as the aggregate impact value AIV. higher values are given by weaker materials. For the majority of aggregates the impact value and the crushing value are similar, but brittle materials such as flints yield impact values which are about 5 units higher than

##  Aggregate Crushing Value
1.The ratio of the weight of fines formed to the total sample weight in each test shall be expressed as a percentage, the result being recorded to the first decimal place: Aggregate Crushing Value = (B/A) X 100 where A = weight of oven-dried sample B = weight in 'g' of fraction passing through 2.36 mm IS sieve. 6.Video Aggregate Crushing Value Test
