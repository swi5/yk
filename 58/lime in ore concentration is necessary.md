Summary. Lime is used to increase soil pH to optimal levels (6.0-6.8) for plant growth. Lime recommendations are given when soil pH values drop below critical thresholds that cause expected yield reduction. Critical thresholds vary by crop tolerance such that lime is recommended for legumes at pH<6.0 and grasses at pH<5.3.

The ores are found mixed with earthy impurities like sand, clay, lime stone, etc. These unwanted impurities in the ore are called gangue or matrix. The process of removal of gangue from powdered ore is called concentration or ore dressing. There are several methods for concentrating the ores. The choice of method depends on the nature of the ore.

## Lime Use in Wastewater Treatment: Design and Cost Data
Concentration of lime solution is usually kept at or below 6 percent. Mixing and agitation is accomplished by water or compressed air jets at a minimum pressure of 2.8 kg/ sq cm (40 psi) or by mechanical agitators.  Another important feature of the solids contact tank is the ability to bring the raw wastewater in contact with high con

## Concentration of Ore - Definition, Methods of Separation, Examples 
Nov 28, 2021We achieve a concentrated ore with a high percentage of metal by eliminating these impurities. The concentration of ore, also known as ore enrichment, is the process of removing gangue particles from ore in order to enhance the percentage of metal in the ore. The difference in physical or chemical properties of the ore and the impurities
