## Water Fluoridation Additives | Engineering | Community Water 
Approximately 5% come from the purification of high-quality quartz. Since the early 1950s, FSA has been the main additive used for water fluoridation in the United States. The favorable cost and high purity of FSA make it a popular additive. Sodium fluorosilicate and sodium fluoride come from processing FSA, or from processing hydrogen fluoride.
