Milling in CNC machining is cutting away part of a workpiece using rotating cutting tools. There are two processes in CNC milling. The automatic process allows a CNC machine to feed the workpiece directly into cutting tool rotation. The feeding direction is always in the direction of the cutting tool's rotation.

## CNC Milling - a Complete Guide to Understand the Process - Fractory
These machines require a manual change of tools after every operation, making the whole process a little slower. Still, modern CNC machining centres include the capabilities of knee-type milling machines. Ram-type milling machines. The ram-type mill has its cutting head mounted on a ram that can slide back and forth.

## Basic Operations Of Milling Machine
Milling Machine: Basic Milling Operations. Aug 09, 2008 Basic Milling Operations Before any milling job—no matter how simple—is attempted, the machinist has to make several decisions. In addition to selecting the best means of holding the works and the most appropriate cutters, the machinist must make an initial estimate of the cutting

1) Plain milling or slab milling. Fig.illustrates the plain and slab milling operation. It is a method of producing a plain, flat, horizontal surface parallel to the axis of rotation of the cutter. This is also called slab milling. This operation produces flat surfaces on the workpiece.
