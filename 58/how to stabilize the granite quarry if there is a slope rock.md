## How to Move Large Rocks: Tips for Hauling Heavy Stones and Concrete Block
Lift the front edge of the stone with a pry bar and slip two pipes underneath. Place one near the front and one about midway so the stone rests on the pipes. Position the third pipe a foot or two in front of the stone. Roll the stone forward onto the third pipe until the rear pipe comes free. Then move the rear pipe to the front and repeat.

## Flagstone: what to use, sand, cement, or gravel?
Especially grade level cement. Especially in a climate with winters like ours in Pennsylvania. A worse way to go about it would be to lay the flagstone upon a bed of gravel and then cement the joints between stones. Horrible idea. The gravel base is flexible and will move ever so slightly during freeze-thaw.
