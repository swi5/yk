## Growth of Nigeria's Mining Industry Fails to Lift Tax Revenues
Industry stakeholders are however divided over the state of Nigeria's mining industry. President, Miners Association of Nigeria, Alhaji Sani Shehu, said multiple taxes being collected by the government at the federal and state levels were bane of development and growth in the mining sector.

## Nigeria's Economic Status And The Mining Sector - Tekedia
It's indisputable that Nigeria's mining sector is presently in a moribund state, despite the government's diversification mantra. Mining is usually referred to as the extraction of valuable minerals cum other geological materials from the earth crust, usually from lode, vein, ore-body, seam, reef, or placer deposits. These deposits constitute a mineralized package that is of economic
