Magnetic separation is the process of using magnetic force to remove metallic or ferrous materials from a mixture. Magnetic separation machines consist of a vibratory feeding mechanism, an upper and lower belt and a magnet. The bulk material is fed through the vibrating mechanism onto the lower belt. At this point, the magnet pulls any material.
