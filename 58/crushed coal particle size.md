## Size Of Coal When Crushered
Abstract. A sieve method of analysis for determining the particle size of crushed bituminous coal is described. The method is applicable to coal less than 1/sup 1///sub 2/ in. (38.1 mm) in size. Square-hole sieves of the following sizes are used: 3.35 mm, 4.75 mm, 6.7 mm, 9.5 mm, 13.2 mm. 19.0 mm, and 26.5 mm. Detailed instructions are given
