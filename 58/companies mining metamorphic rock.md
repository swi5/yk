## Foliated Metamorphic Rocks | Mineralogy4Kids
Foliated metamorphic rocks are formed within the Earth's interior under extremely high pressures that are unequal, occurring when the pressure is greater in one direction than in the others (directed pressure). This causes the minerals in the original rock to reorient themselves with the long and flat minerals aligning perpendicular to the greatest pressure direction.

Here are ten common examples of metamorphic rocks. 1. Soapstone Soapstone is a soft, dense heat resistant rock. The metamorphism of ultramafic protoliths forms it. Its primary component is talc with traces of chlorite and carbonates. Soapstone is suitable for curving because it is soft and heat resistant. 2. Marble

## 7: Metamorphic Rocks - Geosciences LibreTexts
Aug 17, 2021Metamorphic rocks is one of the three rock categories in the rock cycle. Metamorphic rock material has been changed by temperature, pressure, and/or fluids.

Natural gas refers collectively to the various gaseous hydrocarbons generated below Earth's surface and trapped in the pores of sedimentary rocks. Major natural gas varieties include methane, ethane, propane, and butane. These natural gases are commonly, though not invariably, intimately associated with the various liquid hydrocarbons—mainly liquid paraffins, napthenes, and aromatics
