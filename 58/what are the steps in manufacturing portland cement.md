Gypsum which controls the settling of cement. The calcareous and argillaceous raw materials are dried, mixed and heated to a high temperature (around 1000 0 C) in a furnace. The produced granular form is called clinker. Then it is ground with 4% gypsum to obtain Portland cement. There are two main processes in manufacturing Portland cement.

## Manufacturing Process of Portland Cement - TCL Blog
The manufacture of Portland Cement takes place in a number of steps: At TCL's Mayo Quarry, limestone, one of the main ingredients in cement manufacture, is excavated. The limestone raw material then goes through several categories of 'crushing', until it is fine enough for water, sand and iron oxide to be added to produce a mixture known as Slurry.

## what are the steps in manufacturing portland cement
Cement Grinding: cement grinding is the final stage in Portland cement manufacturing. In this step, clinker will be ground in grinding mill to reach the qualified fineness of cement product. During the grinding, we usually add gypsum, fly ash and other raw materials into the cement to realize the different usage of cement.

The first step in both manufacturing processes after quarrying is primary crushing. Crushing reduces the size of the rock to three inches or smaller. Next, the raw materials are combined in the correct amounts and fed into the kiln system. In the dry process, the materials are grounded, mixed, and introduced into the kiln system in a dry state.
