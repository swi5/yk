## Mining Pollution: How to Mitigate the Negative Effects of Mining
The process of mining has also caused structural damage to buildings and has led to buildings collapsing. Water: Water pollution in mining is caused by metal contamination and increased sediment levels in streams. This affects the biodiversity of the water and also affects drinking water for humans.

## Hydraulic mining environmental effects
Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Their families are now able to enjoy a higher standard of living they couldn't previously gain access to. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes.

## Environmental Hazards of Limestone Mining - Seattle PI
Limestone mines use two types of blasting. Small explosive charges set along drilled lines free blocks of stone to be removed for construction. Large charges reduce whole areas of limestone to rubble, which is removed for use as crushed stone. The noise, dust, and impact from explosions can result in noise pollution and dust.

## impact of mining limestone
The most widely adopted method of limestone mining is through opencast pits with bench formation. Limestone mining causes widespread disturbance in the environment. Myriad impacts are observed as changes in land use pattern, habitat loss, higher noise levels, dust emissions and changes in aquifer regimes.

In general though, mining can impact the land/soil, water, air, and all different types of wildlife and living wild organisms. Mining impact can occur: 1. When the land is cleared and modified for conversion into mining use, 2. During mining operations, and 3. Residually after the mining site is abandoned or restored and operations have finished

Many of Florida's unique habitats are the result of the effects of weathering on the underlying limestone. Rain water becomes mildly acidic when it mixes with decaying surface vegetation. Where the overlaying clay layers are thin or absent, the acidic water dissolves the limestone.
