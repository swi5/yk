You can find these on the Limestone Analysis. In other words the Ag index determines the limestone efficiency and the Neutralizing value determines how fast the limestone will dissolve and be integrated into the soil. Therefore, higher the NV and AG INDEX, the higher the quality of the lime you get. Different grades, different price.
