## Sources of sulfur dioxidelfo
Total sulphur in soils varies widely (19 to 4000 mg kg -1) and is present both in mineral and organic forms. However, the total sulphur content is usually of little value for its short term fertility of a soil. Among various forms of sulphur, organic sulphur fraction is the most dominant and constitutes about 80-90 per cent in Indian soils.

According to the obtained results, removal of sulfur content of the iron ore was not significantly affected at high microwave power, high H 2SO 4 and H 2O2 concentration and high temperature conditions. By applying microwave and chemical methods (H 2SO 4/H 2O2) together, sulfur content of iron ore was removed approximately by 84%.
