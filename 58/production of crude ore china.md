China's crude ore is very low grade and is processed into concentrate with a grading of around 66% Fe. Around 3-3.5 mt of crude ore is required to make 1 mt of concentrate. Surging prices incentivized domestic miners to lift utilization rates, and the low alumina content of around 0.34%-0.8% attracted local mill buyers.

The production of titanium metal accounts for only 5 percent of annual titanium mineral consumption; the rest goes to the titanium pigment industry. Pigments are produced using either a sulfate process or a more environmentally acceptable carbo-chlorination process (described below) that converts TiO2 into TiCl4. The latter process also supplies the TiCl4 necessary for the production of.
