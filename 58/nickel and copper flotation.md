Potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) and sodium isobutyl xanthate (SIBX) are traditional thiol collectors used in the bulk and selective froth flotation of nickel and copper sulfide mineral ores. Individually, they are not selective enough for economical low-grade nickel froth flotation. Therefore, more selective collectors or co-collectors are required.

The separation of copper and nickel is achieved by differential flotation, if the mineral grains can be liberated by grinding. Normal practice is to depress the nickel sulfides by increasing the pH of the flotation pulp to between 9 and 11 and selectively floating the copper minerals.

This study presents the application of combined reflectance spectrum and XRF measurements for rapid online slurry assaying in a coppernickel flotation plant The XRF assays are utilised as calibration samples for the reflectance spectrum measurement keeping the calibration model uptodate.

## Recyclingna-travel
Recycling could be a promising practice to supply a part of raw materials needed for LIBs and avoid environmental impacts of their disposal. Among different recycling processes available for LIBs, pyrometallurgical processes are used in the market. However, very little is known about their environmental and energy impacts. The paper provides a clear overview of the amounts of steelmaking
