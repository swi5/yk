## impacts of iron ore on the environment
Assessment of Environmental Impact of Iron Ore .However, mining of iron ore has copious negative impacts on the environment. As the mining method for Iron is usually open cast, it degrades natural landscapes, surface and ground water, flora and fauna, as well as the ambient air quality within the mining area and its environs.

What is iron mining? Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. Where is most iron ore mined?

The mineral occurs as granular agglomerate, 50 to 500 μm in size, and is closely associated with heterogenite in quartz matrix. Guite is opaque, and has dark gray colour with metallic luster and black streak.
