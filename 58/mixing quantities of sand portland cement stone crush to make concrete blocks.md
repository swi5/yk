## Does using river rock as an aggregate in concrete mix make a  - Quora
Answer (1 of 5): The use of crushed stone or gravel in concrete has positive and negative effects on concrete. Since the gravel grains are round in shape, their surfaces are less rough compared to crushed stone. Therefore, less cement is needed for concrete compared to crushed stone and less holl

Westend61/Westend61/Getty Images. The basic mix ratio for concrete is one part water, two parts cement and three parts sand. An alternative ratio is one part cement, two parts sand and three parts gravel with enough water added until the mixtures reaches the consistency of thick mud. Lime is also a common additive to the mix.

Step 1. Mix mortar for laying flagstones, flooring, bricks and tiles. Use a ratio of 3 parts sand to 1.5 parts cement. Adding hydrated lime to the mixture will reduce shrinkage cracks. It will also make the mortar more waterproof. If you add lime, the mixture will be 15 gallons of sand, 6.38 gallons of cement and 1.12 gallons of lime.

## Cement, Sand And Granite (concrete) Mix Explained - Nairaland
Relationship Between Concrete Elements: CEMENT - SAND - STONE relationship; In practice a 50kg of cement bag contains 2 head pan of cement; this means that if i have a plan to mix 1 bag of cement my mixing ratio would be: 1:2:4 = 1 bag of cement : 4 head-pans of sand : 8 head-pans of stone.

## How Does the Ratio of Sand to Cement Affect the Strength of Concrete 
A pretty standard recipe for mixing concrete calls for one part of cement to every two parts of sand. The result of this recipe, assuming that four parts of gravel are also included in the mix, is a C20-rated concrete. Concrete is rated on a number system that indicates how strong the mix is after it has cured for approximately a month.
