To determine the amount of gravel you will need for your shed foundation first calculate the square footage. In the example diagram shown, a 12×14 shed foundation, the square footage is 168. Next, multiply the square footage by the depth of gravel . If we use 6" of gravel, or 0.5 feet, our cubic footage is calculated as 168 x 0.5 = 84 cubic feet.

Crushing Limestone to produce fine aggregate results in the generation of a substantial amount of fine sizes (minus 0.075mm or #200 mesh) commonly referred to as dust. These fines do not aid in the production of good quality concrete and therefore must be removed from the sand before combining with Coarse Aggregate and cement.
