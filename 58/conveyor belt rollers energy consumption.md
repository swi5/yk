## How to Select the Right Belt Conveyor Roller.au
Two factors contribute to the energy consumption required to operate a large number of rollers on a system. The first is breakaway energy - the power required to get the conveyor started (as much as 13% of your power). The second is the running friction - a substantial amount of energy is required to keep the rollers running.

## Energy saving conveyor belts
A conveyor belt is deformed when running over the idlers. This internal friction - or asymmetrical tension between idler and conveyor belt -consumes energy. Special rubber compounds and belt designs - for instance an additional transverse reinforcement - reduce the indentation and let the belt run easier over the idlers. Such belt types, on

The roller conveyor system is used to maintain product position and is designed for use in decline and incline conveyor systems. Belt over roller conveyors can support heavier loads due to the 1.9-inch diameter rollers. This type of conveyor has less friction than a slider bed conveyor because of the belt riding on top of the bed of rollers.

##  ROI: Reducing Energy Consumption in Belt Conveyor Systems - MHI
Longer belt distance increases the amount of energy required to power the system. Heavier products cause the belt to drag across the bed, slowing the entire system. The increased contact between the belt and the underlying slider bed causes wear on both the belt and the bed, decreasing the life of the conveyor components.

Roller beds create a 5% coefficient of friction, which translates into smaller motors and drives and less energy than slider beds. Two or three rollers should be under every product.
