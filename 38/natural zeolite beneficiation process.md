## Zeolite - Natural and Synthetic - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing 
Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates of the alkaline and alkaline-earth metals. They possess many desirable ion- exchange, molecular sieving, and catalytic properties, which make them valuable mineral commodities. Synthetic zeolites have been used for over 25 yr in commercial processes, but only recently have natural zeolites been viewed as potentially valuable mineral commodities.

Natural zeolite can be modified by single or combined treatment such as heating and chemical modification (acids, bases and inorganic salts). Chemical and thermal treatment of zeolite may result in cation migration and thus affect the cation location and pore opening.
