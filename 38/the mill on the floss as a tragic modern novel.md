## The Mill on the Floss and the Revision of Tragedy | SpringerLink
Abstract. Many critics have seen Eliot as a tragic novelist, especially in The Mill on the Floss. Though the tragic is an essential concept for Eliot, to be sustainable in the modern post-Darwin era it is argued that she believes it must be revised and even democratized. Time is a crucial element in the novel's revisionary concept of the tragic.
