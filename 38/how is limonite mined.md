## Limonite - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
2.2.7.1.2 Preparation of Iron Ore in India. This subsection is based on Kumar (1982). There are three main types of iron ore—hematite, magnetite, and limonite—of which hematite is the most important because of its high iron content. The iron content is around 60%. Thus, the preparation process adopted is very simple.

## Which type of rock is limonite? Explained by FAQ Blog
Limonite (/ˈlaɪ. məˌnaɪt/) is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron (III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as FeO (OH)·nH2O, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Is limonite A true mineral?

## TSHA | Iron Ore Deposits - Handbook of Texas
Used earlier by the iron and steel industry, limonite and other East Texas iron ores have more recently been mined for use in preparing portland cement, as a weighing agent in well-drilling fluids, and in animal-feed supplements. When iron production virtually ceased in 1910, less than 700,000 long tons of ore had been processed.

It is a brittle mineral that cannot be scratched by a knife. The thin, flat, tabular crystals, when joined in groups, are called "cockscombs." When combined into balls or nodules, or into more complicated groups, they are marcasite rosettes. The mineral can be distinguished from pyrite by its crystal form.

Score: 4.8/5 (29 votes) . Limonite is relatively dense with a specific gravity varying from 2.7 to 4.3. It varies in color from a bright lemony yellow to a drab greyish brown. This means that chemical weathering transforms the crystals of pyrite into limonite by hydrating the molecules, but the external shape of the pyrite crystal remains.

This ore is normally rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow and deep purple to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite.
