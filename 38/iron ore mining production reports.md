## South Africa Iron Ore Production To Trail Off In Coming Years As 
South Africa's iron ore production will see 5.0% y-o-y growth in 2021, as mines recover from Covid related production constraints. Expected iron ore production growth in the medium-term will be attributed to new projects coming online in a period where most projects emerging from West Africa have been delayed or cancelled. We expect iron ore production and growth to begin to trail off in

## India Iron Ore Mining to 2024 - Research and Markets
India's iron ore production is estimated to have risen by 14.2% in 2019, to reach 234.9Mt, owing to the acceleration in mine production for several non-captive mines - especially from merchant miners due to the expiration of leases in March this year. Production in 2020 is expected to decline to 205.7Mt; a delay in mineral auctions in Odisha
