## Wet Milling vs. Homogenization: Comparing Pharmaceutical Techniques - BEE I
Wet Milling. The most common method of producing nanoparticles, wet milling is a more effective milling technique than the well-known dry milling. Media milling is known as the 'classical' wet milling technique; this process treats a dispersion of concentrated drug in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid medium with milling balls.

## Wet Ball Mill for Metal Ores and Non-ferrous Metals Wet Milling
Wet ball mill is a kind of equipment which uses grinding medium and a certain amount of liquid (water or anhydrous ethanol) to grind materials. Unlike dry ball mill, wet ball mill adopts the wet grinding method. The characteristic of wet grinding is that the material needs to be soaked in the liquid for grinding. This method can effectively reduce the chance of the material properties changing

## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.
