Modern recycling equipment can identify many kinds of metals, although more complex technology is required to separate non-ferrous metals. Basic metal sorting involves separating ferrous from non-ferrous metals. Ferrous metals contain iron, and are attracted by magnets. This allows iron and steel to be pulled from a waste stream easily.
