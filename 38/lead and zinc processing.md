##  Lead Zinc Extraction Processes
are used for production of lead zinc depending on the type of raw material used as a charge. In the pyrometallurgical process, ore concentrate containing lead, zinc, or both is fed, in some cases after sintering, into a primary smelter. Lead concentrations can be 50-70%, and the sulfur content of sulfidic ores is in the range of 15-20%.

The problem isn't the zinc coating but lead and cadmium, two heavy metals that can exist in the zinc because of the galvanizing process. Should galvanized water pipes be replaced? Galvanized. Galvanized Steel Water Pipes. Galvanized Steel Pipes were used as both supply and sewer pipes from around 1900 to the1960s in Louisville.

1 Mixing: The lead-zinc minerals are sent to the mixing tank for stirring, and control the pulp concentration at 25-35%. Add flotation agent, control the pH value of pulp to 9-11, and stir for 6-15 minutes. 2 Flotation: The process is to suppress zinc floating lead, and then activate zinc.

The lead is then refined by vacuum removal of zinc. Refining continues with the, addition of calcium and magnesium, which combine with bismuth to form an insoluble compound that is skimmed from the kettle. In the final step, caustic soda, nitrates, or both may be added to remove any remaining traces of metal impurities.
