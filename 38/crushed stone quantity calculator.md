With a more properly graded 3/4" washed stone (such as a good filter stone ranging between the 3/8" and 1" diameter), you will have a loose drop of more like 75%, but you will also actually be able to get closer to 100% without talking about your subgrade. If the subgrade is sandy, it will not invade such a well graded gravel as much.

The last things to assess are the estimated weight of the required gravel and its cost. Knowledge about the weight of the cargo may come in handy when it comes to transportation.

## Gravel and Stone Calculator - CalculateConvert
Now multiply the square footage (width x length) by the converted depth (depth inches / 12) This is the total cubic feet needed. Finally, ask your supplier what the density of the gravel or stone you will be using to convert into tons. Typically gravel has a density of 1.42 t/yd 3. So multiply the density by the cubic yard to equal total tons.
