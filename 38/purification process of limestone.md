## Limestone: Rock Uses, Formation, Composition, Pictures - Geology
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.

## 10 Advantages and Disadvantages of Quarrying Limestone
Quarrying limestone is the process of removing this material from the ground. As with any quarrying process, there are certain pros and cons that must be evaluated.  It is the foundation of air purification and water treatment systems of almost any size. List of the Cons of Quarrying Limestone. 1. They can permanently disfigure the environment.

## Limestone for pH Adjustment in Industrial Wastewater Neutralzation 
Limestone is an alkaline agent with the ability to neutralize, or partially neutralize strong acids. The neutralization process occurs when strong acids, in intimate contact with limestone chips, react with Calcium Carbonate (CaCO 3, the primary constituent of limestone) to form water, carbon dioxide, and calcium salts.

## How Does Organic Limestone Form - Realonomics
How Does Organic Limestone Form? It can be formed with the help of living organisms and by evaporation. Ocean-dwelling organisms such as oysters clams mussels and coral use calcium carbonate (CaCO3) found in seawater to create their shells and bones. . The water pressure compacts the sediment creating limestone.

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## How Does Organic Limestone Form - Realonomics
How is limestone formed and where is it found? Most fresh water and sea water contain dissolved calcium carbonate. All limestones are formed when the calcium carbonate crystallizes out of solution or from the skeletons of small sea urchins and coral. .Such evaporation takes place in the hot lagoons of many coral reefs and in most shallow tropical seas.
