Iron is a feasible alternative with a low cost and can even be recycled from scrap or industrial waste like smelting slag, tailings, or scrap steel. This paper provides a comprehensive review of Manganese acid-reducing processes from marine nodules using different iron-reducing agents that include FeS2, Fe2+, Fe0, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4.

Historically, much of the hematite was not recovered and was sent to tailings piles. More efficient processing today allows more hematite to be recovered from the ore. The tailings can also be reprocessed to recover additional iron and reduce tailings volume.

A magnetic separation plant extracts magnetite from the spiral plant's tailings, while a hematite recovery plant recovers fine particles of hematite from the tailings of the magnetic separation plant. IOC's nominal concentrate production capacity is approximately 23.3 million tonnes per year, subject to ore quality.

Apr 15, 2021Filter press dewatering technology for tailings treatment process. Tailings nature The metal minerals in tailings are mainly from siderite and hematite. It is uneconomical to recover under the existing technical conditions; the gangue minerals mainly include clay minerals such as quartz, dolomite, calcite, apatite and kaolin.
