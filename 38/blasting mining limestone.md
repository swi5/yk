How is limestone extracted? Limestone is extracted from the rock either by blasting or mechanical excavation depending on the hardness of the rock. rough crushing. After crushing the stone is sorted into different fractions by screening after which it goes to be processed further. In the grinding process the limestone is ground to a fine powder.

##  Chapter 8 BLAST DESIGN - National Park Service
The economic analysis of the use of explosives is an important part of blasting operations in mining and construction. Explosives are energy, and the efficient use of this energy is a major factor in keeping rock blasting costs under control. High-energy explosives enhance fragmentation, which ultimately produces a positive effect on production

Limestone is extracted from the rock either by blasting or mechanical excavation depending on the hardness of the rock. rough crushing. After crushing the stone is sorted into different fractions by screening after which it goes to be processed further. In the grinding process the limestone is ground to a fine powder.

Air blasting in mining is a method of blasting in which compressed air at very high pressure is piped to a steel shell in a shot hole and discharged. It is often called air overpressure. An air blast is the airborne shock wave generated by an explosion. In underground mining, after an explosion a strong rush of air follows.
