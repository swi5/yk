## Turning Copper Ore into Copper: What are the Processes?
The process of extracting copper for its ore is quite complex and varied. It largely depends on the type of ore in question, particularly whether it is a sulfide or oxide type.  Globally, approximately 80% of copper production is taken from various sulfide sources. Despite what the type of ore is, or where it is derived from, mined copper

## Archaeometallurgical slag
The ores used in ancient smelting processes were rarely pure metal compounds. Impurities were removed from the ore through the process of slagging, which involves adding heat and chemicals. Slag is the material in which the impurities from ores (known as gangue), as well as furnace lining and charcoal ash, collect. The study of slag can reveal information about the smelting process used at the

## copper ore processing and production
Sep 26, 2019· Copper processing is a complex process that involves many steps as the manufacturer processes the ore from its raw, mined state into a purified form for use in many industries. Copper is typically extracted from oxide and sulfide ores that contain between 0.5 and 2.0% copper.

## copper processing - Roasting, smelting, and converting
Iron and sulfur are converted to oxides and are removed in either the gas stream or the slag (the latter being recycled for the recovery of remaining values), leaving a " blister" copper containing between 98.5 and 99.5 percent copper and up to 0.8 percent oxygen. The converter is rotated for skimming the slag and pouring the blister copper.

Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process, beginning with the mining and concentrating of low-grade ores containing copper sulfide minerals, and followed by smelting and electrolytic refining to produce a pure copper cathode. An increasing share of copper is produced from acid leaching of oxidized ores.
