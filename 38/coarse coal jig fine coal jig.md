## USB2 - Air jig for separation of minerals from coal - Google
An improved air jig apparatus and method is disclosed in which a dry magnetic separator is used to separate paramagnetic and ferromagnetic minerals from the dust component of coal cleaned with the air jig. The cleaned product of the dry magnetic separator is combined with the cleaned product of the air jig thereby improving both the quality and the quantity of the unmodified air jig product.

Dilip Kumar, Deepak Kumar, in Sustainable Management of Coal Preparation, 2018. 5.1.4 Application of Modern Jigs. Komag and FCB jigs operate on the same principle as Batac jigs. These modern jigs have made a global revolution in the history of coal preparation. In almost every washery in India, jigs of the Baum type are in use for upgradation of small coal or for deshaling purposes.
