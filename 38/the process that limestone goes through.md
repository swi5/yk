The Process That Limestone Goes Through. Feb 16, 2016 Limestone usually starts in the biosphere, gets recycled into the lithosphere or geosphere, moves to the atmosphere then back to the biosphere. Most limestones actually start as calcium carbonate mud or shells precipitated by organisms in reefs or shallow shelf regions - the biosphere.

Screenings start from what's virtually sand through to 3/16 of an inch in diameter. Pea stones are what we would also consider pebbles, from 3/16 to 1/2-inch in diameter. Finally, "stones" are 1/2-inch through to 4 inches.

## Why Does Limestone Need to Be Sealed?
Limestone needs to be sealed in order to last as long as possible. It maintains the natural appearance of your stone, and can prevent it from getting stained. Even dirt and water can cause a form of "crystallization" within the pores of your limestone, creating detrimental and unsightly stains.

## How does weathering affect limestone? - Internet Geography
Aug 15, 2022Weathering is the breakdown of rock by physical, chemical or biological processes. Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater, which contains a weak carbonic acid, reacts with limestone. This causes the limestone to dissolve. Carbon dioxide from the respiration of animals (and ourselves) is one cause of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

## How does limestone change throughout the rock cycle?
Most limestones actually start as calcium carbonate mud or shells precipitated by organisms in reefs or shallow shelf regions - the biosphere. Lime mud gets buried by overlying sediments over long periods of time and turns into limestone. Limestone in the oceans gets dragged to subduction zones where it gets recycled into the mantle (geosphere),

Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock consisting of more than 50% calcium carbonate ( calcite - CaCO 3 ). There are many different types of limestone formed through a variety of processes. Limestone can be precipitated from water ( non-clastic, chemical or inorganic limestone), secreted by marine organisms such as algae and coral
