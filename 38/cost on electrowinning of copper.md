## The Electrowinning Process: Part One :: Total Materia Article
The Electrowinning Process: Part One. The electrowinning process is a relatively traditional method to recover waste metals through the rinse system and at the same time reduce waste water generation and chemical discharge. The most common metals recovered using electrowinning are gold, silver, copper, cadmium and zinc due to their relative value.

## Innovations: How Hydrometallurgy and the SX/EW Process Made  - Copper
Beginning in the mid 1980s a new technology, commonly known as the leach-solvent extraction-electrowinning process or, SX/EW Process, was widely adopted. This new copper technology utilizes smelter acid to produce copper from oxidized ores and mine wastes. Today, worldwide, approximately 20% of all copper produced is produced by this is process.
