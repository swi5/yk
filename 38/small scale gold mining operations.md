Small-scale mining as opposed to large-scale mining (LSM) is conducted on a lesser scale than that of big mining houses. In the South African context, small-scale mining  by the World Gold Council in 2011 estimated that annual ASM gold production was about 13% of total annual production.

## Reducing Mercury Pollution from Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining 
Mercury has long been used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) to extract gold from ore sediment and rock deposits. ASGM accounts for more than a third (38%) of all anthropogenic mercury emissions to the atmosphere, with most ASGM sector-related mercury emissions coming from the burning of mercury-gold amalgam.
