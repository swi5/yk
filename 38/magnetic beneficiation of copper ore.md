## Three Kinds Of Copper Ore Beneficiation Methods
There are many types of copper ore. China's mining is mainly chalcopyrite, followed by chalcocite and bornite. In addition, there are natural copper, tetrahedrite, azurite, malachite and so on. So far, more than 280 copper-containing minerals have been discovered. China's copper mines are mainly concentrated in Tongling in Anhui, Zhongtiao Mountain in Shanxi, Dongchuan in [.]
