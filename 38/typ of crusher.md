Gyratory crusher is a type of secondary rock crusher. There is a narrow opening at the bottom of gyratory crusher. Only if the stone is crushed into desired shape, it can fall through the opening. The gyratory crusher break down stones by pressing between two components--an eccentrically-gyrating spindle and an enclosing concave hopper.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

While a jaw crusher "chews" and a cone crusher squeezes, an impact rotates the material at intense speeds to break it down in its final stage. Keep in mind, this guide to the types of crushers is a simplistic view of the milling process; there are more nuances to creating aggregate, like the importance of wear liners to break down rock.

Impact crushers are traditionally classified to two main types: horizontal shaft impact (HSI) crushers and vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushers. These different types of impact crushers share the crushing principle, impact, to reduce the material to smaller sizes, but features, capacities and optimal applications are far from each other.
