The Sand Rail you see here is documented as a 1967 model which would put its arrival close to the beginning of the sand rail revolution. Power is provided by a 1.5 liter (1,493cc) flat-four VW Beetle engine fitted with dual carburetors. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a 4-speed manual transmission and a Scat shifter.

Just got a new 2276 Air cooled VW engine built. less than 4 hours of play time and she blew a rod. Not going back to that mechanic again. So now I want somthing powerful, light and reliable. Looks like I need to get an EA81. That is what I gather from all of my searching on the net. Most rail owners that are using subaru engines use the ea81.
