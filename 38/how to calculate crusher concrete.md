Calculation. We already discussed the volume formula from Concrete Volume Calculation which is. Required Cement Quantity for 1 m3 = (Cement Part / Total Parts) x 1.55 = 1/ (1+2+4) x 1.55 = 0.221 m3. Unit weight of cement = 1440 kg / m3. Therefore required cement = 1440 x 0.221 m3 = 318.24 Kg or (318.24/50) = 6.37 Bags.

## Crusher Operating Costs: How to Optimize and Reduce
It is assumed that power is charged to the plant at the rate of 0.75d. per kilowatt-hour in the case of the smallest plant, decreasing as the capacity increases to a minimum of 0.5d. per kw.-hr. for the largest. The power consumption of a machine or installation is usually expressed in kw.-hours per ton as being the most convenient method.

Wear in rock crushers causes great costs in the mining and aggregates industry. Change of the geometry of the crusher liners is a major reason for these costs. Being able to predict the geometry of a worn crusher will help designing the crusher liners for improved performance. A model for prediction of sliding wear was suggested by Archard in 1953.
