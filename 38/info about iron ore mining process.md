## How Do You Mine Iron - Realonomics
How is iron extracted from the earth? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

The ores used in ancient smelting processes were rarely pure metal compounds. Impurities were removed from the ore through the process of slagging, which involves adding heat and chemicals. Slag is the material in which the impurities from ores (known as gangue), as well as furnace lining and charcoal ash, collect. The study of slag can reveal information about the smelting process used at the

Limonite - Limonite (Fe2O3.H2O) is a yellow-brown iron ore. Limonite is a collective term for impure goethite and a mixture of hydrated iron oxides. Process Overview: There are two basic methods of mining iron ore: Surface mining or open-cast mining; Underground or shaft mining. To be competitive, iron mining must be done on a very large scale.

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth?
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however, because iron does not occur naturally, it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

## Iron Ore Facts
Iron ore is rock which metallic iron can be extracted from. Iron ore is the most common element in the world and makes up close to 5% of the Earth's crust. This makes it one of the most abundant rock elements. Iron ore that contains a high quality of hematite or magnetite are known as "natural ore" and they can be entered directly into blast furnaces that produce iron.

## Theerei-balle
The process of black Manganese Phosphating, resistant to corrosion, is applied on steel and cast iron surfaces.It consists mainly of iron and manganese phosphate and reduces wear and tear on workpieces such as pistons, rings, cam shafts, engines, cams, and other similar surfaces. Layer weight may vary between 10 and 30 gr/m2. All iron must be in soluble form.
