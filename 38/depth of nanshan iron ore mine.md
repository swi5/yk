## Geology, Prospecting and Exploration for Iron Ore Deposits
Prospecting involves searching an area for mineral deposits with the view to mine it at a profit. In other words to transform the mineral deposit into an ore deposit. A geologist prospecting an area is looking for surface exposure of minerals, by observing irregularities in colour, shape or rock composition.
