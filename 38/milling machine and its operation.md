## Principle and Working of MILLING MACHINE - Engineering Tutorials
Introduction: Milling is the cutting operation that removes metal by feeding the work against a rotating, cutter having single or multiple cutting edges. Flat or curved surfaces of many shapes can be machined by milling with good finish and accuracy. A milling machine may also be used for drilling, slotting, making a circular profile and gear cutting by having suitable attachments.

Dec 13, 2020A milling machine is a machine tool that cuts metal as the workpiece is fed against a rotating multipoint cutter. The milling cutter rotates at a very high speed because of the multiple cutting edges, it cuts the metal at a very fast rate. This machine can also hold single or multiple cutters at the same time.

## Understanding CNC Milling - Thomasnet
Straddle milling: Straddle milling refers to milling operations in which the machine tool machines two or more parallel workpiece surfaces with a single cut. This process employs two cutters on the same machine arbor, arranged such that the cutters are at either side of the workpiece and can mill both sides at the same time.

Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material [1] by advancing a cutter into a workpiece. This may be done by varying direction [2] on one or several axes, cutter head speed, and pressure.

Milling Machine Definition: The milling machine is a type of machine which removes the material from the workpiece by feeding the work past a rotating multipoint cutter.The metal removal rate is higher very high as the cutter has a high speed and many cutting edges. It is the most important machine in the tool room as nearly all the operations can be performed on it with high accuracy.

A milling ( machine ) removes metal by rotating a multi -point cutting tool against a work piece. The work piece or jobs are fixed on the work table and feed is given against the tool. The table can be given three type of movements: 1. Longitudinal cross wise. 2. Vertical movements. 3. Rotational movements.
