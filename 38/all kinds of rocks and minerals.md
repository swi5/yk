Scientists have discovered over 2000 types of minerals on earth. Rocks are mixtures of different minerals. All rocks are made up of two or more minerals, just like minerals are made from two or more elements. Minerals are what give rocks their rough texture. Why do minerals often have larger crystals than rocks that contain the same minerals?

Apr 7, 2022Rock is a naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals. It is categorized by the minerals & chemical composition and the way in which it is formed. Rocks can be hard or soft, and they come in a variety of colours. The most prevalent minerals found in all types of rocks are feldspar and quartz.

What are Rocks? Rocks are mineral aggregates with a combination of properties of all the mineral traces. Any unique combination of chemical composition, mineralogy, grain size, texture, or other distinguishing characteristics can describe rock types. Additionally, different classification systems exist for each major type of rock.

## Rocks - Geology (U.S. National Park Service)
Introduction. Rocks are all around us. They make up the backbones of hills and mountains and the foundations of plains and valleys. Beneath the soil you walk on and the deep layers of soft mud that cover the ocean basins is a basement of hard rock. Rocks are made up of different minerals, broken pieces of crystals, or broken pieces of rocks.

There are three kinds of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous rocks form when molten rock (magma or lava) cools and solidifies. Sedimentary rocks originate when particles settle out of water or air, or by precipitation of minerals from water. They accumulate in layers.

Identifying common minerals can usually be accomplished by examining a hand specimen. Minerals have distinct physical properties such as specific gravity, streak, and form which can easily distinguish the major rock-forming minerals. More detailed examination of minerals can be undertaken by examining a microscope thin section of a rock or mineral.

Gneiss ("nice") is a rock of great variety with large mineral grains arranged in wide bands. It means a type of rock texture, not a composition. This type of metamorphic was created by regional metamorphism, in which a sedimentary or igneous rock has been deeply buried and subjected to high temperatures and pressures.
