## How to Recycle Glass - I Want To Be Recycled
In order to be recycled, glass is collected, mixed, and then sorted by color — clear, green, and amber — at a materials recovery facility. Most glass then goes to a processor for further cleaning, sorting and crushing into "cullet.". This cullet is mixed with sand, soda ash and limestone and then heated and shaped for reuse.
