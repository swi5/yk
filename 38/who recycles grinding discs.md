## spent grinding wheels recycler s world
We recycle used grinding wheel stubs and used blasting media! Most of the waste from used grinding wheels and spent blast abrasives ends up being sent to a landfill. While this may seem easier than recycling, it can have a harmful impact on the environment and is a missed opportunity to reclaim the material, as much of this waste can be recycled.

Depending on the type of floor you have to grind, there is always a suitable Blastrac tool. Blastrac has created a unique colour coded system specially designed so you know which tool to use depending on the hardness of the surface. Polycrystalline Diamond (PCD) is a very hard material and is abrasive resistant in all directions.

Tom Persky of FloppyDisk told us that they "succeed with 90% of the disks we get", though, and they will always return the disks (usually at an extra $5 to $10 charge to cover international delivery) unless you specify you don't want them back. If you don't, it will recycle them for you and email you the files.

## What is Swarf? Recycling Your Machining Scrap for Cash
The metal that's removed - filings, fines, shavings and turnings - is debris or waste known collectively as "chips" or "swarf." It usually winds up in a bin that's part of a machinist's workstation, and it's generally recyclable. While it can be recycled for use in other manufacturing processes, swarf often ends up being disposed of in landfills.
