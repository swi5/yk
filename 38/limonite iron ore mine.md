## Limonite
Limonite (/ ˈ l aɪ m ə ˌ n aɪ t /) is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as FeO(OH)· n H 2 O, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Limonite is one of the three principal iron ores, the others being hematite and magnetite

## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Most iron ores are extracted by surface mining. Some underground mines do exist, but, wherever possible, surface mining is preferred because it is cheaper. Lumps and fines Crushing. As-mined iron ore contains lumps of varying size, the biggest being more than 1 metre (40 inches) across and the smallest about 1 millimetre (0.04 inch).

Siderite is both an iron ore and gangue mineral. Its principal economic value lies in its high iron content and the absence of process contaminants such as sulfur or phosphorous. It is part of a large group of isomorphous minerals, the calcite group carbonates, which share similar physical properties, and rhombohedral crystal form.

Oct 7, 2020Iron ore deposits in Missouri are divided into three main types: Precambrian-hosted hematite and magnetite, filled-sink hematite and limonite or brown iron ore deposits. Hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) are the most economically significant ores. Limonite (FeO·OH·nH 2 O) was an important ore in the past.

## Limonite - Mining Fundamentals
Limonite - Mining Fundamentals. Limonite is an iron ore, containing a hydrated iron (III) oxide-hydroxide mixture in different compositions. It is one of the two major iron ores, the other being hematite - used in the production of iron. It was named by Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann in 1813 after the Greek word for meadow, indicating its
