## How to choose common mode choke for reducing EMI due to vibration motor 
Hi, In my application, I am using cointype vibration motors and ERM vibration motors for giving vibration alerts. As per the reference provided below, a common mode choke could be placed to reduce EMI and improve EMC. However the specifications of the common mode choke are not provided.

## How to detect and prevent vibration caused by gear reduction motor 
Electric motor and speed reducer (gearbox) are the heavy devices, which must depend on basic force of attaching base to meet the stress generated during gear motor running, therefore, the weight of attaching base is more important. The heavy attaching base will eliminate vibrations during gear motor running. So just keep the attaching base is

Feb 9, 2022When it comes to the selection of the vibration motor, it is necessary to understand the principle and application of the vibration motor. The working principle of the vibration motor is to install a set of adjustable eccentric blocks at both ends of the rotor shaft, and use the centrifugal force generated by the high-speed rotation of the shaft and the eccentric block to obtain Exciting force.

## How motors work and how to choose the right motor for any project
Electric motors work by converting electrical energy to mechanical energy in order to create motion. Force is generated within the motor through the interaction between a magnetic field and winding alternating (AC) or direct (DC) current. As the strength of a current increases so does the strength of the magnetic field.

To choose the correct sensitivity for an application, it is necessary to understand the range of vibration amplitude levels to which the sensor will be exposed during measurements. As a rule of thumb, if the machine produces high amplitude vibrations (greater than 10 g rms) at the measurement point, a low sensitivity (10 mV/g) sensor is preferable.
