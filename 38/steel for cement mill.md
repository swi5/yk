## Concrete versus steel mill construction
Concrete versus Steel Mill Construction. When choosing the best type of construction for a new mill or a major expansion, one has to consider whether to construct it out of steel, concrete or a combination of both. It is generally much more economical to build a small mill of steel construction. The advantages of using steel construction

Steel slags (SSs) are usually classified according to the type of furnace in which they are produced. The properties of the slag depend on the type of process used to produce the crude steel, the cooling conditions of the slag and the valorisation process.

One of the first major uses of slag-lime cements was construction of the Paris underground in the late 1800s. In the U.S., blends of slag and portland cements were introduced in 1896.
