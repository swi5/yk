If your going to convert the mill and lathe to CNC and you need speed control, then why not use a 240 VAC single phase input to 3 phase VFD out per speed controlled motor.. combination of 240V 3-Phase, 240V 1-Phase and 120V 1-Phase requires very careful control by circuit breakers and current detection.

For both wet and dry ball mills, the ball mill is charged to approximately 33% with balls (range 30-45%). Pulp (crushed ore and water) fills another 15% of the drum's volume so that the total volume of the drum is 50% charged. Pulp is usually 75% solid (crushed ore) and 25% water; pulp is also known as ' slurry '.

Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5-10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. T
