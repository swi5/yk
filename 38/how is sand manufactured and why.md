## What is m-sand (Manufactured sand)? Manufacture Process, Properties 
The sand must be of proper gradation ( it should have particles from 150 microns to 4.75 mm proper proportion). Manufacture of the sand process involves three stages, crushing of stones into aggregates by VSI, then fed to Rotopactor to crush aggregates into sand to required grain size. Screening is done to eliminate dust particles and Washing

## Manufactured Sand (M-Sand) for Concrete -Properties and Advantages
The manufactured sand has required gradation of fines, physical properties such as shape, smooth surface textures and consistency which makes it the best sand suitable for construction. These physical properties of sand provides greater strength to the concrete by reducing segregation, bleeding, honeycombing, voids and capillary.

Quartz. Quartz is one of the most commonly found minerals on the earth's surface and is the main component in most types of sand. The mineral is formed by the combination of silicon and oxygen to form silicon dioxide. Quartz mostly appears as a transparent or translucent material. The substance is hard, water-insoluble, and does not decompose.

The sand found on a specific beach is created by its surroundings. It's unique to that beach—like a fingerprint. Most beaches get their sand from rocks on land. Over time, rain, ice, wind, heat, cold, and even plants and animals break rock into smaller pieces. This weathering may begin with large boulders that break into smaller rocks.
