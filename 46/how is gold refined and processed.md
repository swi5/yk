Oil Refining Description: Oil Refining (also called downstream) is an industrial process where crude oil is processed and refined into more useful products. Fractional distillation of crude oil is the key process. Crude is separated in several hydrocarbons. Different boiling points allow the hydrocarbons to be separated by distillation.

Step #7 - Processing (on-site) Once ore is extracted, processing it into pure gold must be done. Ore is first crushed and then undergoes various processes depending on the nature of associated minerals. Processing low-grade ore is relatively simple while higher grades require more extensive processing.

The technology boom for developing pure gold continued with E.B. Miller's process of refining impure gold with chlorine gas (patented in Britain in 1867) and Emil Wohlwill's electro-refining process (introduced in Hamburg, Germany, in 1878). In fact, gold with purity of 99.99 percent is created using a combination of the processes.

The Refining Process. Refiners start with one of two types of gold: a doré bar or scrap. Doré bars are produced by miners and are about 80 percent pure. Refiners increase the purity by separating the other precious metals and less precious metals that are mined with it. Using induction heating, doré bars and scrap are turned into molten metal.
