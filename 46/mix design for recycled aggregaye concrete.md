## New Mix Design Method for Recycled Concrete Using Mixed Source Concrete 
Abstract This study proposes a new mix design method for C30 recycled concrete using recycled aggregate crushed from different strength source concrete (SC). The dosages of cement, water, sand, and coarse recycled concrete aggregate (CRCA) are the same as the corresponding components in natural concrete, but the CRCA should be pre-wetted before casting. Its weighted mean strength has a value

## Concrete Mix Design | Different Grades of Concrete - CIVIL READ
To make ease in understanding we are finding the Concrete mix design of M20 grade concrete. The Concrete mix ratio for M20 grade of concrete is 1:1.5:3 that mean 1 part of cement, 1.5 part of sand (fine aggregate) and 3 parts of aggregate (crushed stone) in volume and then batched for mixing. To know the Concrete Mix Design follow below:-.

May 5, 2022The experimental results showed that when the water:cement ratio is 0.5, compared with the conventional concrete mix design method, the proposed mix design method can increase the compressive strength and elastic modulus by 5% and 22.8%, respectively, and reduce the heterogeneity degree and shrinkage value (90 days) by 8.5% and 23.4%, respectively.

## Sand or gravel under concrete slabyrelax.shop
Concrete slabs can develop voids from a variety of reasons, ranging from sliding soil beneath the slab displaced because of a lack of proper compression, to water erosion slowly washing away the soil over time. Voids can lead to a weakness in the slab, causing dips in the surface, tilting or cracks and breaks.
