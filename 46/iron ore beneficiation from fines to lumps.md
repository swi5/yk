Iron Ore Beneficiation From Fines To Lumps. Beneficiation of iron ore lumps and fines by jigging fter setting a target of 100 mty of steel by 2012, indian steelmakers and iron ore producers are already struggling due to the depleted grade of iron ore available in india the main impurities dominating the indian iron ores are sio2 and al2o3 which

These ores subject to beneficiation yield a concentrate containing 61.5 to 66% Fe at 62 to 86% yield. In case of BHQ ore, column flotation technique has been adopted to obtain a concentrate of 66% Fe at 44.7% yield. It has been observed that beneficiation of low grade ores invariably pose specific challenge due to the presence of clayey/earthy

alumina, than the fines product. The lump and fines composition targets are set accordingly, to reflect the average difference between lump and fines compositions. The proportion of lump generated, and the composition difference between lump and fines, is referred to as the "lump algorithm". The composition of the original ore, before

## iron ore beneficiation from fines to lumps -- WENGTY
Unlike iron ore sinter and pellets which are manufactured from iron ore fines and or concentrate, lump can be directly charged to the furnace without any pre-processing. As a result, lump has an inherently higher value compared with fines due to the avoidance of agglomeration costs. Australia is a significant producer of iron ore lump. →
