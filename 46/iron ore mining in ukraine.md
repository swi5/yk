## Ukraine's Iron Ore Hangs in the Balance | E & MJ
Ukrainian iron ore mining costs average $30/mt to $40/mt. Raising Taxes. To prevent a "financial catastrophe," Kiev increased the taxes on subsoil resources by five to six times in the beginning of 2014. As a result, the tax (or royalty) to mine and produce iron ore jumped from about 2.5% to 15% of production costs.

## Ukraine: Mining, Minerals and Fuel Resources
In 2018, Ukraine exported almost 37 billion tons of iron ore, which amounted to a total earning of USD 2.9 billion. The country is the seventh-highest manganese ore producer in the world. In 2017, 380,000 metric tons (MT) of marketable manganese concentrates were produced by Ukraine, which was a reduction from the 425,000 MT produced in 2016.
