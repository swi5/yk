## Process Introduction of Sand and Stone Production Line
Sand and stone production line process: 1. Feeding process: The bulk ore from the raw material bin is fed evenly and continuously into the primary crushing equipment by the mine feeder.At present, vibrating feeder is commonly used in the mining industry. It has small volume, simple structure, stable performance and high cost performance.
