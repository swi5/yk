## Sand Extraction: 1. Introduction - GreenFacts
The mining of sand, a non-renewable resource Level 1: Highlights Level 2: Long Summary Introduction Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b).
