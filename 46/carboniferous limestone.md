## Carboniferous Timechart | Fforest Fawr
The Carboniferous Period. This period extended over 60 million years. It is divided into two series/epochs which are further subdivided into stages/ages. Confusingly the Carboniferous Period has been subdivided in a variety of different ways in the past so many other terms are still in common use. American geologists have traditionally treated

The Carboniferous Limestone as an aquifer. The Carboniferous Limestone is a massive, well-fissured karstic limestone that gives large water supplies of up to 175 l/sec from resurgences in the Mendips and South Wales, and borehole yields of up to 40 l/sec from the upper parts of the aquifer.

The rocks are part of the Pembroke Limestone Group of the Tournasian/Visean epoch of the Mississipian subdivision of the Carboniferous Period. The Carboniferous Period lasted from 359 to 299 million years ago (mya) but the Tournasian/Visean part only lasted from 359 to 326 mya. The CBMF were deposited around the middle of that period.

Carboniferous Limestone is a hard sedimentary rock made largely of calcium carbonate. It is generally light-grey in colour. It was formed in warm, shallow tropical seas teeming with life. The rock is made up of the shells and hard parts of millions of sea creatures, some up to 30 cm in length, encased in carbonate mud.

## Carboniferous
The Carboniferous (/ ˌ k ɑːr b ə ˈ n ɪ f ər ə s / KAHR-bə-NIF-ər-əs) is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period 358.9 million years ago (), to the beginning of the Permian Period, 298.9 million years ago.

The work of examining the Carboniferous Limestone of County Clare was undertaken with a view to ascertaining whether the zonal sequence of the fauna, established by Dr. Arthur Vaughan for contemporaneous rocks in the Bristol district, and since proved to hold good for other localities in Great Britain, was also applicable to these beds in the West of Ireland.

Carboniferous Limestone is a hard sedimentary rock made largely of calcium carbonate. It is generally light-grey in colour. It was formed in warm, shallow tropical seas teeming with life.
