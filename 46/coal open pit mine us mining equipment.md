Mine The Coal. When planning is completed and all permits granted, mining begins. Seams of coal may be close to the surface or buried deep underground. Surface mining is the technique used when coal is found near the surface. Surface mines use large earth-moving equipment, such as excavators, shovels and loaders.

## Mining - Open pit mine | ArcelorMittal
Most iron ore mining operations use the 'open pit' method, where miners drill into the rock and blast the ore-bearing material loose with explosives. Huge excavators are then used to gather the loosened ore. To mine metallurgical coal, which will later be turned into coke, it's usually necessary to sink vertical mine shafts to access coal which is deposited in layers or 'seams
