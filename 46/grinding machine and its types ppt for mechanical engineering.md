## Errors in measurement and its types | The Mechanical post
Errors will somehow get into all measurements no matter how much care is taken. But it is the responsibility of the person performing the measurement to take proper care so that the errors can be minimized as much as possible. Errors can be broadly classified into 3 categories which are: Random errors. Systematic errors.

Milling Fixtures: A Milling fixture is a work holding device which is firmly clamped to the table of the milling machine. It holds the work piece in correct position as the table movement carries it past the cutter or cutters. Essentials of Milling Fixtures: 1: Base: A heavy base is the most important element of a milling fixture.

## Grinding process
The utility grinding machine is intended for offhand grinding where the workpiece is supported in the hand and brought to bear against the rotating grinding abrasive wheel. The accuracy of this type of grinding machine depends on the operator's dexterity, skill, and knowledge of the machine's capabilities and the nature of the work.

## Grinding machine
A grinding machine, often shortened to grinder, is a power tool (or machine tool) used for grinding.It is a type of machining using an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool.Each grain of abrasive on the wheel's surface cuts a small chip from the workpiece via shear deformation.. Grinding is used to finish workpieces that must show high surface quality (e.g., low surface roughness) and high

A bolt is a mechanical fastener with threaded shafts. The bolts are closely related to screws, which are also mechanical fasteners with threaded shafts. This type of fastener is usually inserted through two parts, which have aligned holes. By some definitions, whether a thing is a bolt or a screw depends on how it is used.

## Surface Grinding Machine: Definition, Parts, Working, Advantages 
The advantages of the Surface Grinding Machine are as follows. A high surface finish can be produced. It can produce a smooth surface on metallic and non-metallic surfaces also. No skilled operator is required. Manual and Automatic operations can be performed on it. The work can be easily performed on this machine.

## Drilling Machine: Definition, Types, Parts, Working Principle 
Drilling Machine: It is a machine which is used to drill the holes on the components or workpiece with the help of drill bits. The drill bits are also called as Multi-point cutting tools which can have their rapid impact on the Material Removal Rate (MRR) i.e. a single-point cutting tool (like the one used in a lathe machine) can remove the material slowly whereas, a multi-point cutting tool

## Grinding Machine || Definition,Working,Parts,Operation&Types
A grinding is metal cutting operation which is performed by means of a rotating abrasive wheel that acts as a tool. These are mostly used to finish workpieces which must show a high surface quality, accuracy of shape and dimension. Mostly, it is finishing operation because it removes material in very small size of chips 0.25 - 0.5 mm.
