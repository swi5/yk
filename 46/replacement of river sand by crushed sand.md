## Crushed Sand: Types, Advantages & Disadvantages
What is Crushed Sand? Crushed sand is a replacement for river sand in a concrete building. When Crushing hard granite stone produces manufactured sand. The manufactured sand (M-Sand) size is reduced to less than 4.75mm.  proving to be cost-effective as a building material replacement for river sand. In many circumstances, it can also save on

The effects on each of these properties were examined by changing the percentage replacement of Natural River sand (NS) with crushed rock sand (CRS). An optimization study was performed to study the effect on the properties of concrete when paste content was held constant and the fly ash was considered to be powder instead of aggregates.
