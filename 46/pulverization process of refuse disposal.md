## The method of refuse disposal, involving burial in trenches, is calleda 
Incineration is the process of disposing of dewatered sludge by burning them in a furnace. Pulverisation is a technique of refuse disposal by grinding refuse to a lesser volume thereby changing its character.

## Is pulverization a word?pro
What is pulverization in metallurgy? in engineering, fine crushing of a solid material (to particles of less than 5 mm). Pulverization is used extensively for the concentration of mineral products in mining, as well as in metallurgy, the chemical industry, and construction. In essence pulverization is a process of formation of new surfaces.

## 8 Waste Disposal Problems And 8 Fantastic Solutions - Almost Zero Waste
Here are the 8 common waste disposal problems and their solutions: 1. Landfill pollution. There is a lack of proper on-site waste management in most landfills. This issue increases leachate, which is the liquid formed when waste breaks down in the landfill. This liquid is highly toxic and can pollute land, groundwater, and waterways.

## Solid-State Shear Pulverization of Plastics: A Green Recycling Process 
Abstract. A novel process called solid-state shear pulverization (S 3 P) has been developed at Northwestern University to recycle single or commingled postconsumer or preconsumer polymeric waste without sorting by type or color. This continuous, one-step process converts shredded plastic or rubber waste into controlled-particle-size powder ranging from coarse (10 and 20 mesh) to fine (80 mesh

## Solid Waste Management:- Methods, Disposal, and Treatment
Pulverization - Pulverization refers to crushing and grinding. In this method, municipal waste is pulverized in grinding machines so as to reduces its volume and physical character. Pulverization is the first process applied to solid waste where the main objective is to recover material from waste that can be recycled or marketed.

## Is pulverization a word?tankandlift
What is pulverization in metallurgy? in engineering, fine crushing of a solid material (to particles of less than 5 mm). Pulverization is used extensively for the concentration of mineral products in mining, as well as in metallurgy, the chemical industry, and construction. In essence pulverization is a process of formation of new surfaces.
