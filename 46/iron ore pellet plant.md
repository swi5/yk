## Iron Ore Pellet - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Raw material for pellets is produced by crushing and grinding low-grade iron ores—typically of the taconite class and finer than 325 mesh (0.044 mm)—and magnetically separating the iron oxide (magnetite, Fe 3 O 4) from the siliceous gangue.

## Understanding Pellets and Pellet Plant Operations - IspatGuru
Many pelletizing plants are located near iron ore mines. This is because these plants are installed to pelletize the iron ores which are beneficiated at these mines. Such plants receive the iron ore by rail and/or slurry pipelines. Many other pelletizing plants are installed away from the iron ore mines.

## What is iron ore pelletization?pro
Iron ore pellets are spheres of typically 6-16 mm (0.24-0.63 in) to be used as raw material for blast furnaces.  The process of pelletizing combines mixing of the raw material, forming the pellet and a thermal treatment baking the soft raw pellet to hard spheres.
