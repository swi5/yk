## Common Types of Industrial Mining Equipment & Machinery
Continuous miners are large industrial mining machines designed to cut through coal and soft minerals. According to the Kentucky Coal and Energy Education Project, they are used in roughly 45% of all underground coal production sites . Nowadays, continuous miners are remote-controlled and powered by electricity.
