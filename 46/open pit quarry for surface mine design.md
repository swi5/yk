Open pit mines can be used in coal mining, and they are used extensively in "hard rock" mining for ores such as metal ores, copper, gold, iron, aluminum, and many minerals. In a open pit coal mine, the pit bottom would be the bottom mined coal seam elevation, since it is usually feasible to extract multiple seams when surface mining coal.

## Open-pit mining
Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, [1] is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow . This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.

## Slope stability assessment of an open pit using lattice-spring-based 
Slope stability is an important geotechnical issue in surface mining operation, because slope failure can result in production halt, losses of mining machineries, and human casualties. Reliable slope design in civil and mining projects can not only improve safety but also avoid unexpected construction cost overrun due to slope failure.
