Sand and gravel are naturally occurring materials shaped by the water in which it is formed and transported. Erosion and weathering render the stone round instead of angular. This shape is the principle difference between crushed stone and sand and gravel . About 44% of construction sand and gravel is used as concrete aggregates, 25% for road.

Ideally what you want to have is a wide range of aggragate sizes for the best concrete, with a good variation in sizes from small to large. It seems to me that if you took the quarry dust and mixed it towther with a latex fortifier and portland cement you could make a good thinset mortar, which would be better suited for thinner applications and small cracks and joints.

## Stone Dust Doesn't Belong Under Pavers. Here's Why.
In contrast to stone dust, concrete sand provides superior performance over time. It doesn't eat away at pavers, it affords excellent drainage, and it compacts well. The coarse texture also acts to hold pavers in position, providing a stabilizing buffer that allows the ground underneath to shift without shifting pavers.
