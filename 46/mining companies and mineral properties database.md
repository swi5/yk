## Public Miner Database | Identify global mining companies
The objective of the Public Miner Database is to rapidly identify relevant mining industry opportunities with an elevated probability of success. The focus on exchange listed companies is due to the fact that public miners constitute the majority of the market, are generally more forthcoming, and more frequently publish up to date information.
