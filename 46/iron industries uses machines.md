Mechanical transport is essential in iron and steel manufacturing but exposes workers to potential struck-by and caught- between hazards. Overhead travelling cranes are found in almost all areas of steel works. Most large works also rely heavily on the use of fixed-rail equipment and large industrial tractors for transporting materials.

## Copperbookdate
Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon content (less than 0.08%) in contrast to that of cast iron (2.1% to 4%). It is a semi-fused mass of iron with fibrous slag inclusions (up to 2% by weight), which gives it a "grain" resembling wood that is visible when it is etched, rusted, or bent to the point of failure..

## Losses in DC Machine - Different Types and Their Working - ElProCus
Electrical/copper can occur within the windings of the DC machine-like field copper or armature. These types of losses mainly include different losses like filed copper loss, armature copper loss & loss because of the resistance of brush contact. This kind of loss will give about 30% to 40% to full load losses.

These required iron for their tracks, locomotives, and as components for many kinds of equipment. The relationship of railways with the iron industry was close and continuous. However, such was the variety of demand for iron that the industry was never dominated by railway demands even at the heights of the mania in the 1840s.
