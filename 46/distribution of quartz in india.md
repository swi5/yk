## Distribution and origin of quartz in the sediments of the Indian Ocean 
Quartz in the Indian Ocean sediments is thus mainly continent-derived. Our data further suggest that, because of increased continental aridity and/or increased intensity of winds, higher mounts of quartz were transported in the form of atmospheric dusts from the Arabian and Australian deserts into the adjacent ocean during the Last Glacial.
