Panning. Gold panning is mainly a manual gold separation technique from other materials. Large, shallow pans are filled with gold-containing sand and gravel. The pan is submerged and shaken in water, sorting the gravel gold and other material. It quickly settles down to the bottom of the pan as gold is much denser than rock.

## Gold Mining Process
Miners use heavy mining machinery to drill wide steps known as benches, which separate the rock containing gold (ore) from the rock with no economic quantities of gold (waste). Next, blasting occurs to break down the rock making it easier to move. A fleet of excavators mine designated ore areas and move the gold containing ore to stockpiles.

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

## Salination - Appropedia
Salination, salinisation or soil salinity is the salting of the earth or soil in land either though human-induced or natural causes. It often occurs in land that has been used for agricultural purposes or where land has been cleared of native habitat. Excessive irrigation causes the watertable to rise and in so doing, dissolved salts are brought to the soil's surface.

## Causes of Soil Salinization, Sodification, and Alkalinization
Introduction. Soil salinization refers to the process of salt accumulation in terrestrial landscapes. It occurs naturally where evaporation is high relative to precipitation (there is a seasonal water deficit) and leaching is insufficient to move salts out of the soil profile (Duchaufour, 1982; Schofield & Kirkby, 2003), often in landscapes that do not drain into the ocean, called "endorheic
