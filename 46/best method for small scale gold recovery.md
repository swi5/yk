## How efficient are they really? A simple testing method of small-scale 
Estimates the gold recovery rate of an artisanal and small-scale mining sluice at 91%. Abstract This paper demonstrates a simple, minimally-invasive method of estimating the gold recovery rate of gravitational separation equipment used by artisanal and small-scale miners at alluvial gold sites in the Guianas, South America.

First, the material is screened to remove large rocks and boulders. Then a sluice or jig is used to recover the gold. For deposits with high clay content, the rocks are cleaned with a trommel or rotary scrubber to remove contaminants, and then gold recovery can take place.

Gold extraction using mercury is comprised of the following four stages: 1) amalgamation, 2) separation of amalgamation, 3) removal of excess mercury, and 4) burning of the remaining amalgam to produce a gold sponge.

Moissanite is also doubly refractive, unlike diamonds which are singly reactive. This means that light is refracted through the stone in a way that looks doubled, similar to how light refracts in gemstones like zircon and sapphires. It's also almost as hard as a diamond, ranking 9.25/10 instead of 10/10 on the hardness scale..

## Understanding small-scale gold mining practices: An anthropological 
Artisanal and small-scale gold mining in the Amazonian countries has undergone important technological improvements in recent decades. Nevertheless, this type of mining is largely associated with the use of rudimentary, low-tech and often manual methods, with inefficient gold recovery.

## An Overview of Basic Gold Separation Methods
Most of the mining in such conditions involve small scale miners who don't have enough resources to by sophisticated machines to help in the mining process. Most of these miners use simple rudimentary methods to extract the important minerals. These are often very similar methods that were used by the early-day gold miners during the 1800's.

## 6 Types of Micro-Gold Recovery Equipment in Action
Catch and recover that small gold. 1. Blue Bowl Concentrator. The Blue Bowl is one of the simplest and most popular pieces of gear that a miner can use. Getting the proper setup is important, but once you've got it dialed in it does an excellent job. How to use a Blue Bowl. Watch on. 2. Gold Cube Concentrator.
