For other uses, see Iron Ore. Iron Ore is an ore in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It can be crafted through a smelter into iron ingots, with one ore making one ingot. Iron ore is used to make iron ingots at a smelter; from there, it can be used in creating and improving iron weapons and armor, as well as a number of materials in The Elder Scrolls V: Hearthfire.

Based on the ore characteristics (e.g. particle size, mineralogy and grade), gravity concentration (jig and Humphreys spiral), magnetic separation (low and high-field) and inverse cationic flotation (especially applied to pellet feeds) are used [3], [4]. It is estimated that for each tonne of beneficiated iron ore, 400 kg of tailings are produced.

## Concentration of Ore - Biology Reader
The concentration of ore can is the chemical process of eliminating impurities like sand, rocks, silt, grit etc. from the ore for the extraction of metal.  Sulphurized ore: These contain sulphides of metal like iron, and lead. Examples: FeS 2 (Iron pyrites), PbS (Galena), HgS (Cinnabar) etc. Halide ore: These contain halide of metals.

Ores found on the earth contains many impurities like sand, rocks, and grit in them, which are collectively known as "Gangue".The concentration of ore is a method of removing gangue particles or other impurities in order to purify the ore. This process is also called Ore-dressing and benefaction.It is a very crucial step to obtain a pure metal from ore and to extract the metal.

## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview - IntechOpen
The iron ore is mined mostly from open pit deposits through mining operations and the raw product, "run of mine," is subjected to mineral processing. Thus, the material is exposed to a series of operations of fragmentation, separation by size, concentration, dewatering, etc., aiming to adequate the chemical, physical, and metallurgical
