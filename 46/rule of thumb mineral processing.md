## Beware the 'rule of thumb' - Well, Shawn said.
In this case, the "rule of thumb" is 100% incorrect. Rule of Thumb No. 2, "No storage is permitted anywhere within 18" of the ceiling in a building protected by sprinklers". This rule is simply a misunderstanding of the code requirements surrounding possible obstruction to the flow of water from a sprinkler head when activated.

Establish check-in times so others will know within a few hours if something bad has happened. Carry an appropriate field first aid kit and know how to use it. Finally, take enough water or a filter/tabs to last 24 hours at a minimum. 2) Scope - It's critical to have a clear understanding of your goals.

## What is a Rule of Thumb? - Definition from Divestopedia
In valuation, a rule of thumb is a common procedure or practice used to value a company. These procedures are based on past valuation experiences and estimates in that industry, rather than specific calculations. Rule of thumbs typically involve using multiples that are relevant to whichever industry the valued firm is in. Advertisement

It says you should spend 50 percent of your net income on needs, (the essentials such as bills, food, and rent), 30 percent on wants (things that make life more enjoyable and fun), and the remaining 20 percent on savings. As you can see, this rule (of thumb) is pretty straightforward and easy to remember or follow through with.

A rule of thumb value is a 2% delivery increase per degree of downslope. This is obviously the approach to get the most tonnage per dollar investment. By downsloping, the feeder is getting some "free" assistance from gravity. With increasing downslope, however, there is an inherent loss of control.

The first step of the injection molding process is clamping. Injection molds are typically made in two, clamshell-style pieces. In the clamping phase, the two metal plates of the mold are pushed up against each other in a machine press.. 2. Injection When the two plates of the mold are clamped together, injection can begin.

## Archie's Rule of Thumb for Mineral Deposit Economics - Blogger
Several years ago I came across a reference to "Archie's Rule " which is a rule of thumb method for evaluating the economic viability of a mineral deposit. Simply and elegantly stated: To be economic a deposit must have a recovered value of twice the all-in operating costs. This allows for the covering of the capital costs.

## Rules of Thumb for Valuing Minerals, and Why You  - PetroleumEvaluations
The general rule of thumb is that the value of a mineral deed is about two to three times larger than the value of a mineral lease. So, if the current going rate for leasing minerals in an area is $1,000/acre (say, with a 15% royalty rate), then the value for outright selling those mineral rights should be between $2,000/acre and $3,000/acre.

Most cheaper shredders can handle wood and other material up to 1/2 inch, powerful consumer chippers can handle diameters up to 4 inches. For thicker wood, you need a professional wood chipper.
