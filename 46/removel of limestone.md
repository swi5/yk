## Limestone | Density, Heat Capacity, Thermal Conductivity
Limestone - Thermal Conductivity. Thermal conductivity of Limestone is 1.3 W/ (m·K). The heat transfer characteristics of a solid material are measured by a property called the thermal conductivity, k (or λ), measured in W/m.K. It is a measure of a substance's ability to transfer heat through a material by conduction.

## Limestone
Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium

Techniques which rely on ionic charge, such as ion-exchange and continuous deionization, have very little impact on removal of colloidal silica. Ionic silica is much smaller sized than colloidal silica and due to this, mechanical removal techniques such as flocculation, clarification, filtration and flotation are not an effective removal process.
