## Basic principle and process of flour milling system - Hongdefa
The basic principle of wheat milling is to make use of the differences in the characteristics of the components of the wheat, especially the difference in the intensity of the cortex and endosperm, by grinding and screening the endosperm and separating the endosperm from the cortex. The process of wheat flour mill has the following basic rules:

## Working Principle and Types of Milling Machine
Adjustable working table of milling machine will hold the workpiece and movement of adjustable working table will govern the feeding of workpiece against rotating milling cutter. As we have discussed above, rotating cutter will be mounted with spindle which will be driven by electric motor and hence rotating cutter will rotates with high rpm.

Milling machine is a machine tool that form a work piece as it is fed against a rotating multi point cutting tool called milling cutter. The cutter rotates at a high speed and as it is provided with many cutting edges, it removes the metal at a very fast rate. The milling machine can also hold one or more number of cutters at a time.

Mounted horizontally or vertically, the hammers swing freely around the shaft to crush aggregate material fed into the pulverizing chamber from above. It is then progressively crushed between the milling elements (mantle and concaves), finally exiting the pulverizing chamber at the bottom through the influence of gravity.

The rolling process is a metalworking operation in which metal strips pass through a set of rollers to reduce sheet thickness and achieve uniform thickness throughout the sheet. The sheet is deformed along the linear axis. Typically after the rolling, metal sheets go through annealing which is done under a closed environment of nitrogen.

With roller milling, steel rollers quickly explode the grain over a series of passes through the mill. The reground flour is thoroughly sifted to remove the bran and germ, thereby also removing some of the nutrients. The friction of the roller milling process also produces higher temperature flour, which is reported to affect the nutrients as well.
