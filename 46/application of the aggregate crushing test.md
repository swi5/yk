The mean of the crushing value obtained in the two tests is reported as the aggregate crushing value. APPLICATIONS OF AGGREGATE CRUSHING TEST The aggregate crushing value is an indirect measure of crushing strength of the aggregates. Low aggregate crushing value indicates strong aggregates, as the crushed fraction is low.

Aggregate crushing plant is a combination of feeding device, crusher device, conveying device, screening device and power system. As a result of the great development of the basic construction and the reconstruction of the towns and the rapid rise of the high-rise buildings, the old-style buildings die out, and the waste of the construction wastes is directly buried without.

## application of the aggregate crushing test
Aggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load. Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions.

## Aggregate Impact - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The aggregate impact value is the proportion of the sample that passes a 2.36 mm sieve after the hammer impacts. European Standards will not contain the 10 per cent fines test or the aggregate impact value test (although a different impact test, the German Schlagversuch test, has been included).
