Multiply the length (L), in feet, by the height (H), in feet, by the width (W), in feet, and divide by 27. This will tell you how many cubic yards of sand or stone dust you need (in the construction world, most materials are measured in cubic yards). For example, let's say your stone patio is 20 feet long and 20 feet wide.

Great statement piece. $800.00 or best offer. Apply FibaTape strips to the exposed surface, making sure to overlap each strip. Wearing gloves and dust mask, measure 6-8 cups of QuikWall into the large bowl. Avoid making the most common mistake of adding too much water. Slowly add small amounts of water, mixing after each addition.
