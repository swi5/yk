## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## The Step-by-Step Process of Producing Iron from Iron Ore
The raw materials mix or "charge" enters the furnace from the top and hot air is blown or blasted from the bottom causing the coke to burn and the oxygen to combine with carbon in the coke to form carbon monoxide. Now, this carbon monoxide that is unstable, reacts with the ore to form carbon dioxide and iron. The Separation Of Iron-.

## Sintering: A Step Between Mining Iron Ore and Steelmaking
The United States was estimated to have produced 2.0% and consumed 1.6% of the world's iron ore output Globally, iron ore production in 2018 was expected to increase slightly from that of 2017, primarily owing to increased production in Australia and the completion of a mine in Brazil.
