The mining of gypsum mines is mostly carried out using the open field method, so a large number of goaves are inevitably formed after mining is completed. With the gradual increase in the exposed area and the influence of surrounding loads, accidents such as pillar deformation and roof collapse are prone to occur in the goaf [ 1, 2, 3 ].

Gypsum can be ground up and "boiled" (calcined) at a comparatively low temperature until 75% of its moisture content has evaporated. When that happens, the rock becomes a fine powder, commonly known as Plaster of Paris. By returning the water to the powder, one can make a pliable mortar that can be formed into any shape and hardened.
