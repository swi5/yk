## Improved method to measure the strength and elastic modulus of single 
The standard methods used to determine the mechanical properties of single aggregate particles have shortcomings. Indeed, methods that are commonly used to measure the strength of irregular particles do not provide their elastic modulus and are also only semi-quantitative. The aim of this work is to determine more accurately both the tensile strength and the elastic modulus of single coarse

Strength of Coarse Aggregate The strength of the actual material will determine the final strength of the concrete mix. Some rocks and stones are stronger than others thus, giving higher resistance to cracking and crushing. Granite, for example, is far stronger than limestone. Therefore, it is a common aggregate used by contractors.

## Coarse Aggregate | Coarse Aggregate Size | Coarse Aggregate Sieve 
Determining the Proportion of Coarse Aggregate Based upon gradation done proportion of aggregates is determined. Generally, two sizes of downgraded coarse aggregates are utilized in construction; that is 20 millimeters and 10 millimeters. The factors affecting the selection of coarse Aggregate is;

## How to Determine the Aggregate Crushing Strength Value in  - ReadCivil
The aggregate crushing value is defined as the ratio of the weight of fines passing through specified IS (here 2.36mm sieve) to the total weight of sample expressed in percentage. W1= Weigh of the total aggregates (Wa-We) W2= Weigh of aggregates passing through 2.36mm IS sieve. Aggregate crushing value= ( W2 / W1 ) × 100
