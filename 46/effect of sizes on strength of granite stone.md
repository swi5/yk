As the sizes of coarse aggregate increases then the compressive strength will also increase with constant water to cement ratio (w:c -0.5 and Mix proportion 1:2:4) The workability of concrete get improved after increasing larger sizes of aggregates in concrete. The various result indicates that the sizes of coarse aggregate are directly

## The Effect of Stone Content, Size, and Shape on the Engineering 
Three size gradations of limestone aggregate (#10-#4 sieve, #4-1/2 in., and 1/2 in-3/4 in.) were each admixed with dried clay in 10 percent by weight increments from 10-80 percent. Limestone aggregate, subrounded in an abrasion apparatus, was mixed with the same clay in similar proportions to study the effect of stone shape.

## Effects of Aggregate Sizes on The Concrete Strength
The project has some aims of verification. One of the most important purposes of this project is to compare the strength of concrete made with granite of different sizes eg 20, 15, 10 and 5mm. These same types of concrete are made under the same mix proportion. Another purpose also is to know the compressive strength of concrete at different ages.

## Size effects on granite behavior under unloading rockburst test
Based on previous studies of rock behavior versus rock sample size and various research on rockburst simulation tests, a modified true-triaxial unloading testing machine was utilized to perform rockburst tests on granite specimens with changing heights for size effect investigation. The parameter of the height-to-thickness ratio (H/T) is proposed to characterize the rock scale, and it varies
