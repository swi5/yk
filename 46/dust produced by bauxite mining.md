## The Environmental Impact of Aluminum (And Why it's Still Better Than 
Bauxite is collected from the ground in an open-pit mining operation. It doesn't sit very deeply in the earth's crust, so some energy can be saved on drilling. However, to recover all the aluminum in an area, swaths of land must be bull-dozed to reveal the dirt and ore underneath. Once collected, the bauxite ore has to be refined
