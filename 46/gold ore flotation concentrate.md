Arsenical gold ores that do not contain significant base metals are treated using a bulk flotation method, where all the sulphides are first recovered into a bulk concentrate. In case the gold is contained either in pyrite or arsenopyrite, separation of pyrite and arsenopyrite is practiced. There are two commercial methods available.

## Gold ore flotation process
Jul 28, 20222. Flotation + concentrate roasting + calcine leaching This gold ore flotation process is generally used for insoluble gold-arsenic ore, gold-antimony ore and gold-pyrite with extremely high sulfide content. A small amount of concentrate is obtained by flotation, which reduces the processing capacity of subsequent operations.

Alternatively using soda ash for pH adjustment can reduce gold depression. Where gold is associated with pyrite in base metal ores where iron sulphides are depressed and report to the tailings, a separate tailings pyrite flotation concentrate should be considered. Producing a pyrite concentrate with associated gold maximizes gold recovery.
