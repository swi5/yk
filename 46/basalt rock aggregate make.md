## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
Basalt: An igneous rock often used for road pavement or concrete aggregates. They are also used for masonry projects Granite: An igneous rock that is durable and easily polished. Because of the color, grain, and polishing ability, they are often used inside homes for countertops or on the outside of monumental or civic buildings.

Basalt fibers are fabricated by melting crushed basalt rocks at 1400°C and drawing the molten material. Basalt fibers have better mechanical and physical properties than glass fibers, their main advantages being: fire resistance, good resistance to chemically active environments, vibration and acoustic insulation capacity ( fib, 2007 ).

basalt, extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock that is low in silica content, dark in colour, and comparatively rich in iron and magnesium. Some basalts are quite glassy (tachylytes), and many are very fine-grained and compact. It is more usual, however, for them to exhibit porphyritic structure, with larger crystals (phenocrysts) of olivine, augite, or feldspar in a finely crystalline.

## Using Basalt Stone for Paving & Dimensional Projects
Basalt is a medium to dark gray, fine grained igneous rock - similar to granite in durability. As a fine-grained extrusive equivalent of gabbro, igneous stones (granite, syenite, diorite, gabbro, andesite and basalt) are formed when magma, or molten rock / lava, within the earth cools.
