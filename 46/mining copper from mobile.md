## Mine tailings: reprocess, recover & recycle - The Intelligent Miner
Say a copper mine produced 1Mt of metal in 1999 at 90% recovery. The remaining 10% of copper, around 111kt, went to tailings. If the average copper price in 1999 was US$1,500/tonne then that 10% represented US$166.5 million of metal. Fast forward 20 years and at today's price, US$5,842/tonne, if that material could be reprocessed and an extra
