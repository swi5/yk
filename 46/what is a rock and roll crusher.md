## Roll Crushers - ScienceDirect
Roll crushers consist of two or more adjacent rolls placed parallel to each other and rotated in opposite directions. Single roll crushers are also available which rotate a single roll against a fixed breaker plate. Mineral or rock particles placed between the rolls are nipped and then crushed as they pass between the rolls.

## Type of crushers and their difference - JXSC Mining
The double roll crusher is the most common rock stone crushing machine. Its crushing ratio is usually lower than in other crushers, so it's suitable for fine crushing. The roll crusher uses compression to crush materials, and the reduction ratio is 2 to 2.5 so roller crushers are not recommended for abrasive materials.
