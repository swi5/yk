## Concrete Milling: Why, What and How to Mill [Tips] - Shuanglong Machinery
Concrete Milling is the process that involves removal of upper layer of concrete to obtain a smooth surface. Due to faulting and rutting of wheel studs, the upper layer of roads becomes uneven over time. Some of the areas that need milling are; roads, pavements, bridges, parking lots and sidewalks. The paved surfaces, thus, needs to be renewed
