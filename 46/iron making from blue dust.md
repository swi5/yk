An ancient alchemy sustained Hopewell Furnace: transforming mineral into metal. Since 4,000 years ago, when humans learned how to free iron from ore, the basic process has not changed. Iron oxide is heated in an intense flame fed by carbon fuel. Oxygen in the ore combines with carbon monoxide released from the fuel and is expelled as CO2.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Study confirms dust born iron fed plankton blooms and caused ice age.
The findings, published in Science, 21 March 2014, confirm Martin's longstanding theory that wind-borne dust carried iron to this region of the Antarctic. This iron bearing dust drove plankton growth and eventually led to the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The great work of the authors also disprove the skeptics arm-chair
