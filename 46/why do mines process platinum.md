## Extraction and Refining of the Platinum Metalsey
From this stage onwards the concentration of the platinum group metals is more rapid and the processes entirely chemical. First the slime is subjected to roasting and leaching attacks to remove the last of the copper, nickel, iron and sulphur. This produces an enriched slime running approximately 65 per cent of the platinum group metals and gold.

## Platinum Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart | Cases - JXSC
Platinum (element #78, symbol Pt) is a dense, silvery-gray metal. The platinum group of elements consists of metals with similar physical properties as platinum and these elements are among the rarest in the Earth's crust. They have high melting points, are dense or heavy and are non-reactive with other elements.

## why do mines process platinum
These are all extracted during the mining process. Because of the rarity of pgm and its tendency to combine with other metals, the mining process often yields far more nickel or copper than it does platinum. In South Africa, the world's largest producer, platinum is mined in an area called the Bushveld Igneous Complex.

## What Are the Platinum Group Metals and Why Do They Matter?
Platinum has a high melting point and temperature stability, is highly corrosion oxidation resistant, and it is a good oxidation catalyst. Platinum is biologically compatible and has many significant applications in medicine. Palladium (Pd): Palladium is also used to make jewelry although it's not as popular as platinum.

4) Difficulty in Milling Platinum Ores. Mining is an extremely difficult process that requires enormous amounts of energy. Technically speaking, it is impossible for one machine to mine platinum at a time! Every machine must use 24 separate robots which are controlled by 24 other robots to dig the ore from the ground.

## What is Rhodium and Why is it So Valuable? - New Age Metals
It is considered the rarest and most valuable precious metal in the world â far more so than gold or platinum. Rhodium's primary use is in catalytic converters of automobiles, where it reduces the amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) exhaust gases emitted into the atmosphere. In 2019, almost 90% of rhodium demand was from the auto-catalyst sector.

Blast hole Drilling is a technique used in mining whereby a hole is drilled into the surface of the rock, packed with explosive material, and detonated. The aim of this technique is to induce cracks in the inner geology of the surrounding rock, in order to facilitate further drilling and associated mining activity.
