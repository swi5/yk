## How To Make Glass From Sand - Learn Glass Blowing
When lightning strikes glass, sand can be used to make it. Sand is heated up by lightning, causing atoms to crystallize and lose their orderly structure. If the liquid cools quickly enough, it forms glass. Sand and glass are made up of a compound known as Silicon Dioxide, which is found in chemistry labs. This is the name given to glass tubes

The process of melting sand (and other ingredients) into glass requires a lot of heat and expertise. For ages, skilled craftsmen would blow the glass and work the material into a usable bottle, or roll it into beautiful sheets of glass panes for churches and cathedrals.

All glass is made from sand, but not all types of sand are used to make glass. This is because silica is the main material needed for making glass, and sand with a lower amount of silica crystals is likely to produce low-opacity glass in too small a quantity. For sand to be used for glassmaking, it must: Contain a Higher Percentage of Silica

For our purposes we will use potashas the flux. An alternative is broken glass in place of sand if it is available. Some glass will begin to get soft at around degrees and go liquid at around 1400. But to make glass from sand requires a much higher heat for a longer period of time along with other materials besides sand.

Borosilicate glass is a type of glass with silica and boron trioxide as the main glass-forming constituents. Borosilicate glasses are known for having very low coefficients of thermal expansion (â‰ˆ3 Ã— 10 âˆ’6 K âˆ’1 at 20 Â°C), making them more resistant to thermal shock than any other common glass. Such glass is subjected to less thermal stress and can withstand temperature differentials
