## Iron Agglomeration Process
Sintering is a thermal agglomeration process that is applied to a mixture of iron ore fines, recycled ironmaking products, fluxes, slag-forming agents, and solid fuel (coke). The purpose of the sintering process is manufacturing a product with the suitable characteristics (thermal, mechanical, physical and chemical) to be fed to the blast furnace.

Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes. Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes Pelletizing is a process which involves mixing of very finely ground particles of iron ore fines having a size which is less than 200 mesh (0.074 mm) with additives like bentonite and then shaping them into near oval/spherical balls having size in the range of 8 mm to 16 mm in

Oct 1, 2021A novel iron ore agglomeration process using concentrated solar flux, called a solar-based LMP process is proposed. The process has been tested using laboratory experiments inside a hybrid solar simulator reactor setup. The results indicate no change in the reaction mechanism of LMP formation under solar irradiation compared to electrical heating.
