Once the oil sands is hauled out of the mine, the ore is first processed in an Ore Preparation Plant (OPP), where clumps of oil sands are broken down and mixed with hot/warm water to produce a pumpable slurry. OPP facilities have evolved considerably in recent years and provide a critical first step in the extraction of bitumen.

Surface mining is defined as the extraction of ore from an open pit or burrow. Surface mining is sometimes known as open-pit, open-cut or open-cast mining and is only commercially viable if the deposit is located relative close to the surface. Less than 20% of Alberta's bitumen reserves are close enough to the surface to be mined.

This "Mineralogy in Mining" blog series started with a general overview of the value of mineralogical monitoring for an efficient ore beneficiation.During the last decades high-grade iron ore deposits, particularly in Western Australia, required hardly any downstream processing. Iron ores were simply crushed and shipped as lump ore for iron making.

Open-pit mining clearly offers a number of economic advantages over underground mining, especially now that mineral-processing technology has advanced to the stage where very low-grade ores can be treated profitably. 100 to 150 years ago, this was not the case, and mining was still much more selective.
