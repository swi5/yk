## Why & How to Use Recycled Crushed Concrete - Superior Groundcover
What is Recycled Concrete Aggregate? Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA)  During this reconstruction project, the old concrete was recycled and reused in the new project. Later, In the 1970s there was a big push to reduce landfill overflow. Crushed concrete became a more and more popular material choice for both roadways and driveway construction.

## Recycled Aggregates for Concrete: Problems and Possible Solutions
The substitution of 100% of the natural aggregates > 4 mm is possible, but depending of the porosity of the attached mortar in the recycled concrete aggregate an important decrease of the strength and elastic modulus of the new concrete can appear. Recycled concrete aggregates can improve the retention of chlorides.

The reason for recycling is the reduction of waste in order to protect nature against pollution, the increasing shortage of suitable dumping grounds, and to save energy and natural resources. Concrete debris is typically reclaimed as recycled aggregate (RCA). By recycling concrete, valuable landfill space and natural resources are preserved.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Recycled fines are not recommended, but otherwise RCA can be used in the full range of aggregate sizes between minimum and maximum. Recycled concrete pavement may not produce enough aggregate for both pavement and base course, but acquiring extra RCA to make the base course 70 percent recycled and 30 percent virgin makes the new pavement

Aggregate, or gravel, is the cheapest and most durable of these four common vehicle entry materials. It's a wonderful option because asphalt driveways look great and are known to last 15 years or more. The best method to create a cheap driveway is to install it personally. Driveways can be made of concrete, gravel or asphalt.

## Luckily, with proper maintenance and occasional repairs, tarmac 
Concrete is a very durable option and requires very little maintenance. Clay tile: cost between $5 and $10 per square foot. Mathematically, concrete absorbs 10 times less energy than asphalt at 20°C. With a typical runner of 70kg landing with about 3-5x body weight of force, neither concrete nor asphalt compress any measurable amount

Crushed concrete can then be reused as an aggregate in new concrete or in any structural layer. This reuse of concrete reduces the need for mining other aggregates such as gravel and relying on the transportation of aggregates.

## Concrete Recycling Process | Different Ways to Use Recycled Concrete 
It is possible to reuse it. You will need to break it down into smaller pieces and then use that for the foundation of something new. Crushed concrete can be recycled into base material for new construction projects or reprocessed to create aggregate (crushed stone) that can be used in the production of asphalt, ready-mix cement and other products.

## Mechanical Properties Of Recycled Aggregates Concrete
The states that do use recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) in new concrete report that concrete with RCA performs equal to concrete with natural aggregates. Most agencies specify using the material directly in the project that is being reconstructed. Recycling of concrete is a relatively simple process.
