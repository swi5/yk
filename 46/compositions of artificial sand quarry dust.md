Gravel is made by crushing rocks, or finding smaller rocks in the wild; crushed gravel hovers between 0.75 inches and 1 inch in diameter, though smaller sizes also exist. There's also pea gravel, which are small, rounded pebbles between 0.25 and 0.50 inches in. Types of gravel for driveways include our hardwearing materials such as granite

The determination of best-packed composition for the quarry dust was associated with the highest dry apparent density . This density was obtained according to the Brazilian NBR 3388 norm [] for 10 different compositions considered in the simplex method, Fig. 1.For each composition, three samples were used to assure statistical validation.

## Assessment of Distribution and Composition of Quarry Mine Dust: Case of 
Abstract. The study aimed at assessing the distribution and composition of dust produced at Pomona Stone Quarry mine in Harare, Zimbabwe. The source contribution to ambient PM 2.5 and PM 10 dust levels were quantified and their spatial distribution from the quarry to the receptor (community). The study also analysed the pH of soils around the mine, SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 levels in quarry dust.
