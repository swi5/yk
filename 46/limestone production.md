To make Portland cement—the most common type of cement—powdered limestone is heated in a rotary kiln. As a source of calcium, it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker, which is then ground with a source of sulfate, like gypsum. It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete.

## Understanding Limestone in Cement - Concrete Construction
The change is that the specification adds up to 5% limestone. The biggest difference in production is that the limestone is added to the clinker blend before grinding. Because the limestone is softer than the clinker it will grind preferentially, resulting in a cement with a better particle size distribution with less energy.

Limestone is made up of calcium carbonate compounds. Calcium carbonate is an essential compound in the manufacture of agricultural lime, also known as 'Aglime.' This agricultural lime is used in the neutralization of soil acidity. 'Aglime' also frees us important soil minerals, such as different types of phosphates. 3.) Steel Industry
