## CNB - Lean hematite technology combining dressing-fine 
The invention relates to a lean hematite technology combining dressing-fine screening and shaking table gravity separation. The technology is characterized in that a high frequency vibrating fine screen is used to check and grade the grinding product and the gravity separation device and technology are adopted to perform the upgrading production flow.

## Hematite: Meaning, Healing Properties and Powers
Hematite is a grounding stone that is mostly used for protection and stability. The word "hematite" is derived from a Greek word that means "blood." As a result, it is known as the "bloodstone" and has been employed as a talisman against excessive blood flow. Hematite is a kind of iron ore that is made up of iron oxide crystals.

## Hematite Separation Processningepc
Hematite is main mineral form of iron oxide and main ore mineral of iron.Hematite coexists with magnetite which can be transformed to hematite by oxidation and remain form of hematite forming the illusion of hematite. Hematite separation process is suitable for complex structure hematite such as hematite and impurities with uneven distribution

## how a gravity separation works for hematite beneficiation
Gravity Separation Process Hematite India. Gravity separation of zinc mine tailing using.In such a way, this work aims through gravity separation to concentrate the mineral phase hematite.The shaking table was used to process 500 g of the tailing.Three different materials were obtained after the separation process hematite concentrate, middling, and gravity separation get price.
