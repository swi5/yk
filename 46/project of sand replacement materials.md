Concrete is an artificial stone manufactured by mixing together coarse and fine aggregates, cement, water and often other components such as cement replacement materials, e.g., pulverised fuel ash, and chemical admixtures, e.g., superplasticisers. The grading of an aggregate defines the proportions of particles of different size in the aggregate.

## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
The percentage passing 150 microns of manufactured sand is relaxed to 20% (while that of natural sand is limited to 10%). As per design and economics, crushed sand can be used to partially or fully replace river sand from a concrete mix. The Availability of crushed sand is not a concern as it can be manufactured from rocks in any season.

## Sand Structure: Measuring Density and Porosity of Sand | Science Project
Divide the mass of the sand by the volume of the sand. Calculate the air space volume. It will be equal to the volume of the sand alone plus the volume of the water alone minus the volume of the sand/water mixture. Calculate the fractional air space. Another way to measure the air space is as a percentage of the total volume of the sand.
