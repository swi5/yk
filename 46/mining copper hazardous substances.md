Diarrhea, nausea, eye irritation, abdominal pain, headache, and muscle aches are typical symptoms of excess levels of copper. Toxic levels of copper are extremely harmful for the liver. Those who cannot eliminate excess copper for genetic reasons called Wilson's disease undergo chelation process.

Mining involves toxic substances like sulfuric acid, cyanide, and solvents to separate and process the mineral from the ore. These poisonous substances often poison the top layers of soil. This poisoned soil is why nothing often grows near mines. The most pressing effect of poisoning the topsoil, as that this eventually reaches groundwater.

Copper toxicity (or Copperiedus) is a type of metal poisoning caused by an excess of copper in the body. Copperiedus could occur from consuming excess copper salts, but most commonly it is the result of the genetic condition Wilson's disease and Menke's disease, which are associated with mismanaged transport and storage of copper ions.Copper is essential to human health as it is a component of
