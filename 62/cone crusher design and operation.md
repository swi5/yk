The spring cone crusher design is able to pass uncrushable materials e.g. tramp metal, through the crushing cavity by using springs. The first hydraulic cone crusher was developed in 1948 and this allowed for the opening of the crushing cavity hydraulically, instead of using springs (mechanical actuation).

## Moving vs fixed cones: understanding the differences - Quarry
A LIVE SHAFT CRUSHER. In the Trio TC cone crusher (see Figure 1), both the shaft and the head are moved in unison eccentrically during operation. This proven design can be traced back to the original cone crushers invented in the 1920s, and a century of optimisation later, it's one of the most reliable crushers in operation today.
