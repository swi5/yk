## iron ore dry process
Iron ore dry screening on ore mining process and iron ore mining equipments.mining and processing of iron ore involves coarse crushing and screening iron ore is beneficiated by crushing and then separating the iron from the gangue minerals through screening this is usually so efficient that lower grade ore can be treated especially when the magnetite is quite coarse.
