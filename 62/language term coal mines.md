## Coal mine reclamation - Global Energy Monitor
Coal mine reclamation is the rehabilitation of land after coal mining operations have stopped. It is a requirement of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) of 1977.. As mining operations cease bulldozers and scrapers are used to reshape the disturbed area. Reclamation should allow for the area to be resistant to soil erosion and, based on the soil requirements, fertilized and

Etymology. The word originally took the form col in Old English, from Proto-Germanic kula(n), which in turn is hypothesized to come from the Proto-Indo-European root g(e)u-lo-"live coal". Germanic cognates include the Old Frisian kole, Middle Dutch cole, Dutch kool, Old High German chol, German Kohle and Old Norse kol, and the Irish word gual is also a cognate via the Indo-European root.

The term colliery includes the coal mine, with its buildings and appurtenances; the mine proper is underground. The entrance to it is by a drift, a slope, or a shaft. "Stripping,"—which is quarrying, and not mining at all,—is only possible where there is an outcrop of a thick bed of coal.

## Coal mining and transportation - Energy Information Administration
Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## expressions - What is "a canary in a coal mine"? - English Language 
34. A canary in a coal mine is an advanced warning of some danger. The metaphor originates from the times when miners used to carry caged canaries while at work; if there was any methane or carbon monoxide in the mine, the canary would die before the levels of the gas reached those hazardous to humans.
