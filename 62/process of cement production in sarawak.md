The new dry-process cement production line technology was developed in the 1950s. So far, in Japan, Germany and other developed countries, the production rate of new dry-process cement clinker with suspension preheating and pre-decomposition as the core accounted for 95%. A suspension preheating and precalcining kiln was commissioned in 1976.

## Cement Manufacturing Process - Chemical Engineering World
Cement is a material which is used to bind other materials together. Binding means it has an effect of gluing the substances together due to cohesive and adhesive action and then hardens and sets in order to become permanent. Cement is usually not used on its own; it is mixed with other materials called aggregates to produce a combined material

The cement production process is one of the most energy-consuming processes and has a strong environmental impact. The main impact on the energy consumption of cement production is the burning process of cement clinker in a rotary kiln, and the energy costs associated with burning cement clinker constitute 50-75% of cement production costs.
