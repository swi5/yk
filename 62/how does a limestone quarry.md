What happens in limestone quarry? In general the limestone quarrying process is quite simple: locate or create minimal breaks in the stone then remove and secure the stone for transport. Access to the limestone deposits is gained by removing a layer of earth vegetation and rock that is unsuitable for product production.

How is limestone extracted? Limestone is extracted from the rock either by blasting or mechanical excavation depending on the hardness of the rock. rough crushing. After crushing the stone is sorted into different fractions by screening after which it goes to be processed further. In the grinding process the limestone is ground to a fine powder.

Limestone. Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.

Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium.
