## Combined Cycle Power Plant | GE Gas Power
Combined cycle power plant: how it works. A combined-cycle power plant uses both a gas and a steam turbine together to produce up to 50% more electricity from the same fuel than a traditional simple-cycle plant. The waste heat from the gas turbine is routed to the nearby steam turbine, which generates extra power. Tour a combined cycle power plant.

## Reactor Thermal Power | Definition & Values | nuclear-power
The term thermal power is usually used because it means the rate at which heat is produced in the reactor core due to fissions in the fuel. Nuclear power plants also use the total output of electrical power. Still, this value is due to the efficiency of conversion (usually from 30% to 40%) always being smaller than the reactor's thermal power.

Hooked up to the farm. April 25, 2013. Offshore wind could provide abundant electricity — but as with solar energy, this power supply can be intermittent and unpredictable. But a new approach from researchers at MIT could mitigate that problem, allowing the electricity generated by floating wind farms to be stored and then used, on demand

## Net power output and thermal efficiency data for single and double 
The datasets contained in this paper are thermodynamic simulations obtained in Aspen Hysys software, the data described represents the net power output and thermal efficiency for Cerro Prieto geothermal power plants, located in Mexicali, México. A single flash and double flash cycle have been selected for power generation at this facility.

## Efficiency of conventional thermal electricity generation
In Figure 1a and 1b, the drop in 2007 is due to increased electrical energy output from conventional thermal power stations in UK, Germany and Turkey. For public thermal power plants the average efficiency increased in most EU-27 countries over the period, resulting in a net efficiency of 49.9% in 2009 (48.2% excluding district heating).
