Coal Mining Technologies. Surface mining of coal requires areas of land to be temporarily disturbed, which raises a number of environmental challenges. As coal mining is only a temporary use of land, a rehabilitation or reclamation plan is designed for each mine covering the period from the start of operations until well after mining has finished.
