MANGANESE 0RE High grade metallurgical manganese ore is generally smelted and refined to produce ferromanganese, an alloy which has long been used in the processing of steel.Just as the main downstream use of ferrochrome is stainless steel. ferromanganese is beneficiated as carbon steel. As an alloying agent, ferromanganese is invaluable.

Manganese is an essential element for modern industrial societies. Its principal use is in steelmaking, where it serves as a purifying agent in iron-ore refining and as an alloy that converts iron into steel. Although the amount of manganese consumed to make a ton of steel is small, ranging from 6 to 9 kilograms, it is an irreplaceable component in the production of this fundamental material.

In nature, aluminum is found in an ore called bauxite.This ore is refined using various techniques to produces aluminum oxide which is called alumina. Tantalum is used when an alloy needs a high melting point and strength. It is used in missiles, aircraft parts and vacuums. Titanium is one of the most abundant and toughest metals on Earth.
