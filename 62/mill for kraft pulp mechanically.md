## Comparison of Chemical Pulping and Mechanical Pulping - CNBM
The pulp yield in the chemical pulping processes is relatively lower than that in the mechanical pulping processes. The reason is that the lignin is completely dissolved and separated from the fibers. However, the lignin from the Sulphate and some Sulphite processes can be burnt as a replacement for fuel oil. In modern workshops, the operation

pulp is produced by the kraft process (about 88 percent of the pulp bleached in 1987 was kraft pulp). Very little mechanical pulp has been bleached in the past, however, this is currently changing.
