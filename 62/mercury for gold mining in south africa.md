## Gold mining
Barrick Gold Corporation has one of the largest open-pit gold mines in North America located on its Goldstrike mine property in north eastern Nevada. Other gold mines use underground mining, where the ore is extracted through tunnels or shafts. South Africa has the world's deepest hard rock gold mine up to 3,900 metres (12,800 ft) underground.

South Africa's abandoned gold mines provide many of the country's unemployed and immigrants with ways to earn money when odd jobs don't provide a sustainable living. With an increased unemployment rate of 25.5 percent, many turn to illegal gold mining off a main road outside Johannesburg which hosts dozens of men hoping to strike it rich.

Gold mining companies had an increase of 35% in revenue. Revenue for the 'other mining' segments increased by 7%. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was evident from April 2020, with reductions in revenue being seen across the industry. South African PGMs and gold are mainly mined in deep-level underground mines and were therefore hardest hit.
