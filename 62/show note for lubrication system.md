## Oil Mist Lubrication System (With PDF) - What Is Piping
Oil Mist System is a means of generating and transporting a finely dispersed oil mist from a central location to individual bearing housings. The oil mist system uses compressed air to atomize oil into micron-size particles which can be effectively moved to lubrication points up to 600 feet (180 meters) through Pipes & Tubes.

## The Function of Diesel Generator Lubrication System
Sep. 10, 2021. The main function of the diesel generator lubrication system is to reduce the friction between moving parts, take away some of the heat absorbed by the parts, wash the surface of the parts, improve the sealing effect of the parts, and prevent rust and corrosion on the surface of the parts.

## How an Engine's Lubrication System Works - Bright Hub Engineering
Purpose Of Lubricating System. The lubricating oil performs the following functions in an engine: The oil lubricates moving parts to minimize wear by sealing the clearances between moving parts such as bearings, shafts, etc. Thus, the parts move on layers of oil, and not in direct contact with each other, which reduces power loss in the engine.
