Calcarenite: Calcarenite is composed of sand-sized grains of calcite, usually in the form of tiny fossils, shell fragments and fossil debris. Some calcarenites contain oolites and if the oolites are present in sufficient quantity, the stone is called oolite limestone. Oolite limestone is a sub-category of calcarenite.

Clay particles are fine-grained and nearly 1/1000 times finer than a standard sand particle of 1mm size. Water carries claystone particles 100 times farther than the sand particles when it flows. Moreover, the sedimentation of claystone particles requires a relatively calm milieu at the water basins in the river and sea.
