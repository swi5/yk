## Jaw Crusher Toggle Plateerprocess
Toggle plate is an important spare parts of jaw crusher, It is designed to shear protecting crusher components if non-crushable object is introduced to crusher; Jaw plate's high manganese steel castings can be reversed allowing extended life.. Recently, concern for energy consumption in crushing has led to the consideration of decreasing the weight (and consequently the stiffness) of the
