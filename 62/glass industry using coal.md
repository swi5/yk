The coal fly ash from a Chinese thermal power plant was vitrified after the addition of ∼10 wt% Na 2 O. The glass products have suitable viscosity at 1200. °C and displayed a good chemical durability.. The heavy metals of Pb, Zn, Cr and Mn were successfully immobilized into the glass as determined by the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure method.

Adopting coal as the main source of fuel created numerous problems for glass production. Burning coal produced short flames which shifted the location of the hearth from the far ends of the furnace to the center.

Glass manufacturing accounts for more than fifty percent of world-wide soda ash production. Specifically, soda ash is used to make the most common type of glass, soda-lime silica glass. It is used as the main ingredient because soda ash naturally reduces melting temperatures and its alkali effectively supports the shaping of the glass item.
