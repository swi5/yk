## Quarry Site Best Practices - Natural Stone Council
Minimize transport distances by designing the quarry with haul distance economy in mind. Consider using an engine-retrofitting system to reduce fuel use and decrease carbon emissions. When purchasing equipment, prioritize the selection of more energy efficient models. Contact your heavy equipment vendor to learn about technologies offered.

## The Design Of Quarry Faces And Slopes | Agg-Net
On a quarry slope formed by three 15m faces at 70° with a minimum bench width of 15m, the reserves lost would amount to approximately 10,000 tonnes per 10m of face when compared with a 7m bench width (fig. 4). When this loss is scaled to actual quarry dimensions, very large quantities of reserves are lost.
