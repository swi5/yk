## Iso :2019
This document gives the determination of aggregate crushing value (ACV) of aggregates. This gives a relative measure of the resistance of the aggregate crushing under the gradually applied compressive load. The method is applicable to aggregates passing a 14,0 mm test sieve and retained on a 10,0 mm test sieve.

## LAB Report AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE (ACV) - StuDocu
So this aggregate was not strong. 4 CONCLUSION. The ACV value is more than 45% for aggregate used for concrete for non- wearing surface and less than 25% for wearing surface like runways and roadways. The higher the aggregate crushing value, the lower the resistance to crushing under the gradually applied compressive load. 5 REFERENCES

Greater is the aggregate crushing value, softer is the aggregate sample and vice versa. This is suggestive of the fact that the resistance of aggregates to crushing is less. Therefore, the strength of such a sample is also less. Aggregates having relatively less ACV can be used in wearing surfaces of pavements. 2)Hardness
