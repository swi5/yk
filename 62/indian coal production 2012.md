## India is in the hunt for the development options, where
The electric revolution has the full support of the Indian government; the financial condition of the automotive market has made it difficult. While there is a vision for 100% electric vehicles by 2030, most industry experts indicate that around 40-45% EV conversion by 2030 is a realistic expectation. A major push.

Global BF-BOF steel production emitted around 3.1 Gt CO2 and EAF production emitted around 0.5 Gt CO2 in 2019. The high CO2 intensities of EAFs in China and India because of their use of large share of pig iron or coal-based direct reduced iron (DRI) as feedstock instead of steel scrap in EAFs causes an increase in global EAF's CO2 emissions.

## Coal in 2022: India's Climate and Energy Evolution - E3G
Jan 13, 2022Reducing reliance on coal will be a key first step in achieving these five objectives: Non-fossil energy capacity to reach 500GW by 2030. This ambitious target is more than three times India's current non-fossil fuel capacity, and more than India's total grid size. While the government is still to provide a sector breakdown, the Central
