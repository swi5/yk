## Limestone - Minerals Education Coalition
Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

## Rock burst process of limestone and its acoustic emission 
In the failure process, various scales, from nano-level or micro-level to macro-level, are involved. As mining and rock mass engineering proceeds to greater depth, the failure mechanism of rock burst needs to be better understood for the optimization design of rock tunneling support and safety operation of mining and underground engineering.

## Limestone Processing - national rocks
The mining activities in the concession cause degradation of topography. Degradation of land is caused by open pit mining methods. In this quarry the deposit seen as horizontally bedded limestone deposit occurs in nearly flat terrain and mining pits will be formed during mining.

Graphite Mining. Pure graphite is a mineral form of the element carbon (element #6, symbol C). It forms as veins and disseminations in metamorphic rocks as the result of the metamorphism of organic material included in limestone deposits. It is an extremely soft mineral and it breaks into minute, flexible flakes that easily slide over one another.
