History - soda. Construction and equipment installation for the first line of soda ash production shops were completed already in six years. From 10th November 1951 Sterlitamak soda plant begins continual manufacture of soda ash. Almost simultaneously, in 1946 began the construction of cement plant. First cement was obtained in April 1952.
