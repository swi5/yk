During hydration, the water content in the concrete mix blends with aggregate and cement in a chemical transformation that provides the best possible strength in the final slab . That initial mix always has more moisture than the final slab</b> will contain.

Another factor that will influence the curing time is temperature. Colder concrete gains strength much slower than warmer concrete. At 3 days after casting, concrete cured at 45 degrees F only has about 70% the strength of the same concrete cast at room temperature (73 degrees F). In contrast, concrete cast and cured at 90 degrees F has about

Ultimate curing takes several weeks although strength tests for concrete are performed after 28 days. Temperature and humidity play a part in this process as well. Warm weather that dries the concrete reduces or slows the curing process. The strongest concrete develops when the material is kept moist and allowed to cure naturally over four weeks.
