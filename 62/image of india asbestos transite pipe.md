## Transite Asbestos Material - Aarons Asbestos & Demolition Services
The use of asbestos to manufacture transite phased out in the 1980s. Previously transite made of cement, used varying amounts (12-50%) of asbestos fiber to provide tensile strength (like the steel in reinforced concrete). It was often used in furnace flues, shingles, siding, and wallboard for areas where fire retardancy is particularly important.

One major application of asbestos over the past 100 years has been transite roofing panels . Asbestos was essentially used as a binder in cement slurry and then formed into profiled or flat sheets. Transite roofing panels can still be found across the country; many are still in place after 50, 60 or even 70 years of life.

Generally that pipe would cause spillage at the draft hood on the appliance. It is really a wonder that more people weren't affected by CO poisoning from oval flues in general with Transite being even worse. It is probably a blessing is disguise as now the gas burning appliances can be properly vented.

## What Risks Do Asbestos Cement Water Pipes Pose to Public Health?
Asbestos cement had become popular as a water pipe material back in the 1930's and 40s. The pipes were cheap to produce, and at the time, thought to be resistant to internal and external corrosion. They can contain up to 20 per cent asbestos. Studies put the length of AC pipe installed in North America at close to a million kilometers.
