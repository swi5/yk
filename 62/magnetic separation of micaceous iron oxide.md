## Immunomagnetic Separation of Microorganisms with Iron Oxide Nanoparticles
Abstract: The early detection of Legionella in water reservoirs, and the prevention of their often fatal diseases, requires the development of rapid and reliable detection processes. A method for the magnetic separation (MS) of Legionella pneumophila by superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles is developed, which represents the basis for future bacteria detection kits.

## Process for preparation of micaceous iron oxide - Google
High purity hexagonal plate-like Î±-Fe 2 O 3, commonly called micaceous iron oxide, is prepared by a hydrothermal treatment of either magnetite or an iron ore, or an iron oxide, of which principal component is magnetite together with an oxidizer in an aqueous alkali solution. Main advantage of this process is a great decrease in the consumption of alkali.
