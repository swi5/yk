Thomas Jefferson even referred to the abundance of coal in his book Notes on the State of Virginia.But in the 18th and early 19th centuries, there was little use for coal, other than in blacksmith fires.

## Coal Types, Formation and Methods of Mining
Conventional mining is the oldest method and accounts for only about 12% of underground coal output. In conventional mining, the coal seam is cut, drilled, blasted and then loaded into cars. Continuous mining is the most prevalent form of underground mining, accounting for 56% of total underground production.

## Coal, Metallic and Mineral Resources | WA - DNR
Mining of coal and metallic minerals in Washington began in the mid to late 1800s. Coal production in Washington hit a high in 2003 with an estimated total production of 6,232,000 short tons, yet production ceased in 2006. Metals mining during the same general time period occurred on both sides of the Cascade divide, but was largely concentrated in the northeastern portion of

## ANTHRACITE COAL MINES AND MINING. | eHISTORY
THREE ink blots on the eastern end of the map of Pennsylvania, between the Delaware and the Susquehanna rivers, represent all the anthracite coal in the United States. They cover an area of 488 square miles, and produced last year 53,500,000 tons,--truly infinite riches in a little room. They are popularly known as the Wyoming, Lehigh, and

## The Geography of Coal in the U.S. | National Geographic Society
More than 90% of the coal produced in the U.S. is used to create electricity. A small amount is used in industrial settings (mainly cement production and iron smelting), and to heat buildings. 70% of the coal produced in the United States comes from Wyoming, West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Illinois—but the electricity from coal is
