Aggregate Test Procedure - The Quality Guru. Oct 04 2020 The aggregate crushing value is an indirect measure of crushing strength of the aggregates Low aggregate crushing value indicates strong aggregates as the crushed fraction is low Thus the test can be used to assess the suitability of aggregates with reference to the crushing strength for various types of pavement components.The

## Procedure Of Aggregate Crushing Value
Aggregate Crushing Value Test Procedure Civil4m. Apr 26, 2018 Procedure for crushing strength of aggregate. Before testing, the aggregate should be in surface dry condition.You can achieve the dry condition of aggregate by placing aggregates in an oven for 4 hours at 100-degree Celcius. The aggregates passing through 12.5mm and retained on 10mm
