Anthracite coal is a dense, clean to touch, and hard rock with a jet-black colour. It is normally non-agglomerating, non-clinkering and free-burning coal because when it is ignited it does not coke or expand and fuse together. It has a low percentage of ash and a high ash fusion temperature.

## Recommendations for Working with Anthracite - Solid Fuels: Coal, Coke 
As noted above, anthracite does not coke, but simply becomes smaller and smaller until it burns away. Therefore, fire management is slightly different from other coals, and is actually somewhat more like how one maintains a charcoal fire. Because anthracite doesn't coke, an anthracite fire doesn't hold its shape as well as a bituminous fire.
