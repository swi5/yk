Excavator types, where do we begin! Excavators come in all shapes and sizes, and have a wide range of designs depending on their function.. From small-but-mighty mini excavators used for tight-access jobs, to dragline excavators used for mining projects, these machines make light work of construction projects.

Strip mining. Strip Mining: Strip mining is a kind of surface mining. The ore is very near to the surface of the land but has one or more layers of rock and filth on top of it. To mine the ore, these layers have to be removed. The steps in strip mining are similar to open-pit mining.
