## Gold Processing Methods & Gold Ore Extraction
Of all the methods of extracting gold & processing it from its ore, I used a few to evaluate two principal flowsheets in this case study. The flowsheets utilized operations that involved flotation, cyanidation and gravity concentration. Tests that mirror each of these unit operations were utilized to evaluate the principal flowsheets.

Gold mining continued for decades, changing hands numerous times until it was closed in 1991. Ore values were generally low, but new extraction methods allowed the mine to remain active, though intermittently, for over a century.

## How to Choose Gold Smelting Flux - Superb Electromachinery Co., Limited
Gold smelting flux helps us to take advantage of this fact in the smelting process. Flux is able to react only with the impure metals, thereby causing them to form nitrates which can separate out neatly. Again, smelting flux makes metallic oxides easy to eliminate, thereby removing another major source of impurity.
