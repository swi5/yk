##  Mechanism of Buildup Formation in An Electric Furnace for Copper Slag 
The copper slag cleaning in an electric furnace is based on slag reduction and settling of copper matte inclusions. Copper recovery depends on the slag temperature, degree of magnetite reduction and slag residence time. The formation of solid buildup on the furnace hearth leads to the decrease of furnace volume and slag residence time, affecting

## Recovery of cobalt, nickel, and copper from slags, using DC-arc furnace 
Conventional slag cleaning furnaces (typically AC submerged-arc) rely largely on a gravity settling mechanism, whereby the entrained sulphide and metallic droplets are simultaneously collected.  Clearly, the temperature has effects other than on the chemical thermodynamics of the system. It has been reported elsewhere (6) that a 100°C

Slag cleaning furnaces are commonly connected to copper smelting units such as Teniente and Noranda converters and Outokumpu flash smelters.

## Dalmia - Slag Cleaning
Slag Cleaning Furnace. In this furnace, copper rich oxide slags are melted in electric arc furnaces and coke & copper pyrite are added to reduce copper content in the slag. In order to increase reaction rate, slag is over-heated to produce low viscosity aggressive slag. Dalmia-OCL's Co-clinker series Magnesia Chrome bricks have excellent

## granulated electric arc furnace slag
Types of iron and steel slag NIPPON SLAG ASSOCIATION. Depending on the cooling method used it is classified either as air cooled slag or granulated slag Air cooled slag The molten slag flows into a cooling yard where it is cooled slowly by natural cooling and by spraying with water This results in a crystalline rock like air cooled slag Electric arc furnace slag is generated when iron
