## How Granite is Extracted from the Earth - Engineering Specialists, Inc.
Extracting the Rock. Granite is usually formed into slabs or large deposits. There are different methods used by mining companies to cut and extract the deposits from the ground which are called quarries. When the granite is extracted, the mining team uses large equipment such as extractors and cranes to slowly dig around the deposits.
