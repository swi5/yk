##  High-Energy Ball Mill Processing - IPEN
this work is to make a review of this technique, with special emphasis on the differences between those routes. Based on that, a suggestion for the classification of the various routes is presented. The high-energy ball mill processing can be divided in two main groups according to the mechanisms involved and/or the purpose envisaged

## Fluid Energy Mill - Construction and How it works? - Solution Pharmacy
Fluid energy mill based on the principle of Impact and Attrition. Size reduction takes place by a high-velocity collision between particles. Construction of Fluid Energy Mill. It consists of a loop of pipe, which has a diameter of 20 to 200 mm. The height of the loop may be up to 2m. Several nozzles are fitted at the bottom of the pipe.
