## Ordinary Portland Cement: Uses, Advantages & Disadvantages
Introduction to ordinary Portland cement: Ordinary Portland cement is one of the most widely used cement. The name Portland cement was given by Joseph Aspdin in 1824 due to its similarity in colour and high quality when it hardened like a Portland stone. Portland stone is white grey limestone within the island of Portland, Dorset.

Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction/Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

## Cement Manufacturing Process - Chemical Engineering World
Cement is a material which is used to bind other materials together. Binding means it has an effect of gluing the substances together due to cohesive and adhesive action and then hardens and sets in order to become permanent. Cement is usually not used on its own; it is mixed with other materials called aggregates to produce a combined material

Manufacture of cement - consists of mixing, burning, and grinding processes. 1. Mixing: It may be a wet process or by dry process.In a wet process wash mill is used which is a heavy cylinder of 2.5 to 3.0 m in diameter and 9 to 12 m in length. It is kept slightly inclined to the horizontal and can rotate at 15-20 revolutions per minute. The cylinder is provided with steel balls.

The process looks a bit like shaking a snow-globe, as it produces a flurry of suspended white particles inside the glass container as the lime precipitates out of the solution. While the technology is simple and could, in principle, be easily scaled up, a typical cement plant today produces about 700,000 tons of the material per year.

White cement, as the name indicates, is a kind of cement with white color. White cement is similar to ordinary, gray Portland cement in all aspects except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this color requires substantial modification to the method of manufacture, and because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the gray product.

There are three steps of the high-temperature system: Drying or preheating, calcining, and sintering. The calcining is the core part of the clinker production; the raw meal is weighed and sent into preheater and cement kiln to process clinker. Grate cooler helps to cooler clinker, the cooled clinker is sent to the cement silo for storage.

## How Portland Cement is Made? Manufacturing Process of Portland Cement
Portland cement can be made by following two different processes - a dry one and a wet one. Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century. Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement. The materials that are commonly used are limestone, shells, chalk, shale, clay, slate, silica sand, and iron ore.

The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of
