## Recycling and disposal of refractories
Chrome oxide has been the most visible refractory to be regulated. EPA expects disposal of hazardous chrome refractories to be accomplished by treatment and/or recycling. The disposal of chrome-containing refractories is the largest and most serious refractory disposal problem that exists. Many manufacturers have stopped using chrome-containing

## Recycle Glass, discover this innovative industry • RecyclingInside
Glass recycling is the processing of waste glass into usable products. The industry term for furnace-ready recycled glass is "cullet." Glass cullet is classified in sizes that can range from pebbles to sand and even powder. Common non-container uses. Fiberglass manufacturing; Abrasives; Binder in ceramics and bricks; Filler in paint and plastic

## Everything You Need to Know About Recycling of Glass
Glass bottles and jars are 100% recyclable and can be recycled endlessly without any loss in purity or quality. Over a ton of natural resources are saved for every ton of glass recycled. Energy costs are reduced 2-3% for every 10% cullet used in the manufacturing process. Glass that is crushed and ready to be remelted is called cullet.

The proportions were about 1:1:1:5, if I recall correctly. I use a layer of half inch kaowool inside a two inch layer of the above refractory, and have never had problems in many hours of operation. I've used portland cement in every homemade refractory I've ever made, and if you keep it under about 10% be volume, it seems to have few problems.

In glass-melting furnaces and other vessels where sodium is a constituent, accumulation of sodium oxide can cause the refractory's melting temperature to decline, thereby reducing its value as a recycling feedstock.

## Recycling Of Glass Furnace Refractory Material (In French)
The European glass industry uses more than 100,000 tons of refractory materials annually for the construction of furnaces that are repaired and rebuilt every 5 to 8 years. Furnace break-down generates an annual production of refractory waste in glassworks of 20,000 t/year in France and around 80,000 t/year in Europe. The waste is disposed of in repository backfills or in private slag heaps.
