## Types of Artificial Grass Infill
Here's a look at some of the different types of infill materials that are commonly used in artificial grass. Silica Sand. Silica sand is derived of quartz that has been eroded by wind and water. As the quartz erodes, it breaks down into small granules. This material is used in several commercial applications, including artificial grass infill.

## How Does Sand Affect Plant Growth - Realonomics
Do plants grow better in sand or clay? However clay soils are often rich in plant nutrients. In contrast sandy soils can drain water too quickly for healthy plant growth and tend to be low in nutrients but they are easier to work. Adding organic material can offset many of the problems associated with either extreme. What does sand do for soil?
