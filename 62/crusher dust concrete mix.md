## Using Crusher Dust in Your Construction Project
By nature of the product, crusher dust is easy to work with, spread, and level out. As the material settles, the dust and smaller pieces fill the gaps between larger pieces of stone, creating a smooth and compact surface. The material is tightly packed, which means there is no shifting, no moving, and no potholes developing over time.

For M20 grade, 25% is the optimum percentage of stone dust mix with the concrete. 30% of stone dust requires relative high cement content.

The machine has a screen that traps the larger material (that is, the crushed stone). The smaller material or "screenings" falls through the screen. Depending on the size of the holes in the screen used, it can be so fine in texture that it is basically a powder. This is what you are buying as "stone dust." But it may go by other names, such as:
