Maintenance and operation can also be enhanced with an optional motor base integrated into the rear frame. This lets the motor move in sync with the crusher, reducing the time you need to spend on V-belt alignment and tensioning. In addition, the greasing of the crusher can be centralized by a distributor or even automated with a greasing pump.
