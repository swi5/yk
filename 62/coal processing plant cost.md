## Coal preparation plant
A coal preparation plant (CPP; also known as a coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP), coal handling plant, prep plant, tipple or wash plant) is a facility that washes coal of soil and rock, crushes it into graded sized chunks (sorting), stockpiles grades preparing it for transport to market, and more often than not, also loads coal into rail cars, barges, or ships.

Their costs are lower because the CO2 streams they process are purer than from coal-fired power plants. One report provided to Net-Zero Business Daily by the CCC estimates the cost of ethanol, ammonia, and gas processing CCS at $15-$20/mt of carbon removed, whereas coal is at $55-$65/mt, and combined-cycle natural gas at $65-$75/mt.
