## Suitability of Crushed Manufactured Sand for Replacement of Natural 
Abstract. The global consumption of natural sand is very high, due to the extensive use of concrete or mortar. The fine and coarse aggregates generally occupy 60% to 75% concrete volume (70% to 85% by mass) and strongly influence the concrete's fresh and hardened properties. Now a day's sand is becoming a very scarce material.
