The dried gold sand is melted in a furnace and cast into bars. Depending on the capacity of the Gold Refinery installation, casting of 400 troy ounces (~12 kg) fine gold bars is done either manually by using a removable crucible and a casting table or by using a Metso Outotec Gold Bar Casting Wheel. The gold bars are then cooled in a water bath.

## Everything about Gold Processing, Smelting, Refining, Cyanidation
The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## The Gold Smelting Process - Melting, Smelting & Refining 
1. Gold Processing. The first step in gold smelting involves processing the gold ore. The ore containing gold once mined from the earth is processed by separating gold minerals from the crude matter holding the ore together. The gold ore is then pulverized using pressure to create very fine particles.

This operation is performed for around two hours to ensure complete separation of impurities from the precious metals. Gold and silver form an alloy that is heavier than the slag and sinks to the bottom of the furnace. Once the smelting is complete, the slag is removed and the precious metals are casted in ingots.
