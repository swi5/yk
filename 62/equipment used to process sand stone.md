## Frac Sand Manufacturing Process
Frac sand is a type of sand with small uniform particles. It is injected into the rock formation along with the water used to fracture the rock in the process known as hydraulic fracturing fracking. The sand is used to prop open the fractures that are created. Because the particles are uniform fluids like water oil and gas are able to
