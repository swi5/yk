## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

##  Beneficiation of Limestone
Usual gangue associated with limestone is silica which is removed only by flotation methods. In addition to this, the nature of terrain and the geo-logical structure of the deposit always adds to the alumina content of the ore as the clay gets mixed up with limestone during mining . This is more so when the mines are mechanised. This clay matter

## What is Limestone? - WorldAtlas
Limestone is a sedimentary rock, although it has a hardness of 3-4 Mohs and a density of 2.5 to 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter. The rock is primarily composed of calcite or calcium carbonate, with most of these rocks being around 95% calcium carbonate. Being so high in calcium makes limestone rock polish and smooth better.

Answer: Limestone deposits are found throughout the world. They are "mined" in a process known as "quarrying." This process varies depending on the use of the product. If it is to be made into cement, it is needed in small pieces so that it can be ground and calcined. In this case, the rock has h

## Deforestation, overgrazing, construction, mining, and poor agricultural 
Deforestation, overgrazing, construction, mining, and poor agricultural practices are some of the man-made factors that lead to erosion. These practices mostly lead to loosening of the soil making it easier for the agents to wash it away. Climate Change, Higher rainfalls lead to more erosion especially in areas with no vegetation cover.
