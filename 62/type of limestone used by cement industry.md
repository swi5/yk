Cement is typically produced by mining, grinding, and heating limestone in industrial kilns to temperatures as high as 2,820 degrees Fahrenheit (1,550 degrees Celsius). The process alters the rock's chemistry and creates "clinker" — the basic component in nearly all types of cement — but also generates large quantities of carbon dioxide.

## Portland-Limestone Cement - National Precast Concrete Association
ASTM C595 and AASHTO M240 were revised in 2012 to define portland-limestone cements with between 5% and 15% limestone by mass. Portland-limestone cement (PLC) has comparable performance properties to ordinary portland cement but improves the environmental performance of concrete. PLC has been used in the United States on a limited scale in

## Emissions from the Cement Industry - State of the Planet
The primary component of cement is limestone. To produce cement, limestone and other clay-like materials are heated in a kiln at 1400°C and then ground to form a lumpy, solid substance called clinker; clinker is then combined with gypsum to form cement. Cement manufacturing is highly energy- and emissions-intensive because of the extreme heat
