Halite (NaCl), gypsum (CaSO 4 · 2H 2 O), and anhydrite (CaSO 4) are the major constituents of the sedimentary rocks rock salt, rock gypsum, and rock anhydrite, respectively.These rocks are usually referred to as evaporites. Halite, the mineral name for common salt, is cubic and is typically colourless or white but may be tinted various colours by impurities.

## Gypsum - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Gypsum (CaSO4 · 2H2O), the most common of the sulphate minerals, is also known as alabaster (a fine-grained massive form), satin spar (a fibrous variety of gypsum), or selenite (colourless transparent gypsum crystals). Gypsum is often found in considerable thicknesses within evaporite sequences and in association with limestones and shales.
