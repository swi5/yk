## Advantages & Disadvantages of Manufactured Sand (M Sand) in 
Manufactured Sand (M-Sand) is among the most useful items in the construction process. Manufactured sand is produced after crushing hard granite stones (usually in cubical shape) into fine particles. In fact, they are crushed repeatedly until they reach a sand state. These fine particles are known as M Sand and are used in construction.
