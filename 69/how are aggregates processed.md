Jul 13, 2022This is because the aggregates processed by hammer crushers have high needle flake content, many dark cracks inside the aggregates, low crushing value and large firmness loss value. Granite and rock-like hard materials are finely crushed by a multi-cylinder cone crusher with lamination crushing function, which minimizes the needle-like content
