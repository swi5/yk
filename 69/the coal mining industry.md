## Coal Production by State | Worldatlas
Over 40% of coal mining and production in the US is done on public lands; however, mining had reduced marginally from 1.17 billion short tons in 2008 to 986 million short tons in 2015. Wyoming, West Virginia, Kentucky, Illinois and Pennsylvania account for over 70% of the total coal industry in the US.

## Coal mining - World Coal Association
The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures, health and safety standards and worker education and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.

Since 1970, NIOSH has compiled data on the prevalence of CWP in underground coal miners. The graph shows a summary of this data. In the early 1970s, the prevalence of CWP was 33% among miners working 25 or more years. The prevalence dropped to less than 5% by the late 1990s. However, since that time, CWP prevalence has increased to more than 10

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit
