Starting at $19,950. Wells-Index mills have a completely different milling head design than any other milling machine in the world. Most heads are based on a Bridgeport design and have been cloned by Taiwanese and Chinese manufacturers. The Wells-Index milling head is a much more robust and durable design for heavy cutting with most components.

## Ramping to Success - In The Loupe - Machinist Blog
Ramping refers to simultaneous radial and axial motion of a cutting tool, making an angular tool path. Oftentimes, this method is used to approach a part when there is a need to create closed forms such as pockets, cavities, engravings, and holes. In doing so, the need to plunge with an end mill or drill to create a starting point is eliminated

## Plunge Rate - Massachusetts Institute of Technology
In general, a plunge rate should be less than 50% of the feed rate, due to typical end mill design. End mills are designed to cut more efficiently in lateral directions, rather than vertically (like a drill bit). Therefore, a gentler plunge rate helps to keep the temperature down and avoid damage to the tool. Remember that when plunge cutting

## Selecting a Carbide End Mill for Aluminum Applications
For aluminum milling a two- or three-flute end mill works best because this allows for larger flute areas. A core diameter of slightly less than 50 percent of cutter diameter is optimum for the same reason. An open flute design is essential for easy chip movement away from the cutting zone.Surface finish on the flute is also critical. Long-chipping, low silicon aluminum alloys have a tendency

For a flat bottom, just drill to size and clean up the bottom with any center cutting endmill - thats the easiest. Two flute center cutting can be plunged more easily than four flutes and if you have a dinky mill its hard to get an accurate sized hole making a plunge cut with an endmill.

## End Mills
The mini-mill comes with 3/8" and 1/2" collets, but you will eventually need 5/8" and 3/4" collets and/or end mill adaptors to hold mills larger than 1/2". 2-Flute Versus 4-Flute. 2-Flute mills are generally used for cutting slots or grooves, while 4-flute mills are more often used for surface milling, using the end of the mill.

In choosing a straight bit for any application, always select one with the shortest cutting edges and the shortest overall length that will reach the required cut depth.Excessive length intensifies deflection and vibration, which degrade cut quality and lead to tool breakage.

## Undercutting End Mills | McMaster-Carr
These end mills have a long shank and a cutting edge that curves around the top of the ball end, allowing them to reach into pockets to create undercuts. Made of solid carbide, they are harder, stronger, and more wear resistant than high-speed steel and cobalt steel for the longest life and best finish on hard material. Their extreme hardness means they are brittle, so a highly rigid setup

## End Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A special class of end mill is termed the slot drill. This is a cutter intended for slotting and keyway cutting. It is provided with end cutting edges which are offset about the centre, so that the longer cutting edge passes slightly over the centre, allowing plunge cutting into the work.

Regular end mill cutters become dull faster, which results in more tool changes and shoddy workmanship. Carbide tools also require less sharpening than steel tools. 2.
