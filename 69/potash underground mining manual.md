It will be mined by conventional room and pillar techniques, and tailings will be returned underground via a hydraulic slurry backfilling system. Current mine planning sets the mine life at 22 years, although there is the

The ore at Moab—which actually lies about 1,200 meters (3,900 feet) below the surface and within the Paradox Formation —began to form about 300 million years ago. In Utah, the miners pump water deep underground to reach the potash ore. Potash is soluble, so water dissolves it into a brine.

## Potash
Potash (especially potassium carbonate) has been used in bleaching textiles, making glass, ceramic, and making soap, since the Bronze Age. Potash was principally obtained by leaching the ashes of land and sea plants. [citation needed]Beginning in the 14th century potash was mined in Ethiopia.One of the world's largest deposits, 140 to 150 million tons, is located in the Dallol area of the Afar
