## Man-Made Gold Indicators - How to Identify Past Mining Activity 
The evidence of historic mining activity is probably the easiest way to identify a place that is gold-bearing. Mining activity that took place even back in the mid-1800s is often very noticeable today, and these indicators are excellent proof that gold can be found there. Even in areas that have been mined hard, the gold is never "mined out."

It is possible to detect gold with a specially designated metal detector. A prospecting detector can find gold as small as a half a grain. As the size of the gold becomes larger, gold nuggets can be located at deeper depths. A single grain nugget can be found at a depth of 1-2 inches.
