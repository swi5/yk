## Indonesia pushing to consolidate coal industry - Australian Mining
Indonesia is taking action to strengthen its coal industry by merging operations, as the market continues to decline. The country is reportedly considering revoking more than 4000 mining licences to remedy the issue, according to Reuters. "At the end of the day it's about equilibrium," Sudirman Said stated at a coal conference in Bali last week.

Feb 10, 2022In Indonesia, coal has long been exploited to satisfy the avarice of those in power. Prior to the country's independence, in 1861, the Dutch colonial government began mining coal in Palaran, East Kalimantan, before kicking off production in Ombilin, West Sumatra, in 1892. In fact, Kalimantan and Sumatra islands are Indonesia's 'supermarket' of coal. As of 2020, coal reserves on the two islands
