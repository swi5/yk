Importance of Aggregate Gradation of concrete slab. Aggregate is commonly considered inert filler, which accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the volume and 70 to 85 percent of the weight of concrete. Although aggregate is considered inert filler, it is a necessary component that defines the concrete's thermal and elastic properties and

The particle size distribution, or gradation, of an aggregate is one of the most influential aggregate characteristics in determining how it will perform as a pavement material. In HMA, gradation helps determine almost every important property including stiffness, stability, durability, permeability, workability, fatigue resistance, frictional resistance and moisture susceptibility (Roberts et

This guide provides a means to determine the optimal gradation of sand and coarse aggregate materials for highway concrete pavements. The guide is, to a major extent, based on the use of a computer model (1, 2) developed by G. M. Idorn Consult A/S (GMIC) for estimating the porosity remaining after the packing of fine and coarse concrete aggregate.
