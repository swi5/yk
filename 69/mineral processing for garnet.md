Garnet is a high-performance filtration media used between solvent extraction and electrowinning, or SXEW. SXEW is a two-part hydrometallurgical process used to produce copper ore. By using garnet as one bed in a multi-media filter, the quality of the cathode plate is improved and related costs are reduced. Lasts for years.

## garnet Archives - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Strategic Minerals, such as uraninite, garnet, monazite, zircon, cassiterite, columbite, magnetite, are often found closely associated with pegmatic orebodies. Concentration of these minerals is frequently complicated by hardness of the ore, presence of the clayey materials, and the fact that mineral sizes range from micron dimensions up, and

## Garnet: Mineral, January birthstone, abrasive, filter media - Geology
What is Garnet? Garnet is the name used for a large group of rock-forming minerals.These minerals share a common crystal structure and a generalized chemical composition of X 3 Y 2 (SiO 4) 3.In that composition, "X" can be Ca, Mg, Fe 2+ or Mn 2+, and "Y" can be Al, Fe 3+, Mn 3+, V 3+ or Cr 3+.. These minerals are found throughout the world in metamorphic, igneous, and sedimentary rocks.
