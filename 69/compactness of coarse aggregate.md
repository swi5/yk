Coarse aggregates usually form the stone skeleton. Fine aggregates fill the voids of the coarse aggregate skeleton and asphaltic mastic that consists of bitumen, and the filler acts as the binder phase to bond all of the aggregates together as a whole. In such a structure, the coarse aggregate skeleton is the main load-carrying part and thus it

Natural stone and recycled concrete with sizes of 5 to 16.5 mm were both selected as natural coarse aggregate (NA) and recycled coarse aggregate (RA), respectively.  However, if the moisture was exceeded, more water was released into ITZ, increasing the porosity and deteriorating the compactness so that the water adsorption was increased again.

## FINENESS MODULUS OF AGGREGATE - WHAT, WHY & HOW
Fineness modulus is generally used to get an idea of how coarse or fine the aggregate is. More fineness modulus value indicates that the aggregate is coarser and small value of fineness modulus indicates that the aggregate is finer. Fineness modulus of different type of sand is as per given below. Type of Sand. Fineness Modulus Range. Fine Sand.
