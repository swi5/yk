## Types of Surface Mining Equipment | 360training
Above ground, or surface mining, includes strip mining, open-pit mining, and mountaintop removal mining. Essentially, surface mining is the term used to describe any mining where the rock overlying the mineral deposit is removed. In underground mining, the overlying rock is left intact. Minerals are removed via shafts and tunnels.

More useful is to look at the mining industry in general. Statista reports that, in 2020, the United States had the following active mines: 6,251 sand and gravel pits, 4,281 stone quarries, 1,009 coal mines, 895 nonmetal mines, and 278 metal mines. Sand, gravel, stone, coal, and many of the metal and nonmetal mines are likely to be of the open pit type.

## Open-pit Mining - Mining North Works
Open-pit mining occurs on surface and is generally the cheapest way to extract ore. This is because rock doesn't have to be moved far up hill against gravity, equipment used can be larger than underground, and it doesn't require more expensive features like ventilation, communications, etc. that underground does.

## Palabora Copper Mine, Palabora, South Africa - Mining Technology
The very competent rock allows the pit walls to be cut much steeper than is normal in open-pit mining. The Palabora copper mine is South Africa's leading copper producer. It is located 360km north-east of Pretoria, close to the Kruger National Park. The project was previously developed by Palabora Mining Company (PMC), which was owned by Rio

## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open-pit mining is the process of extracting rock or minerals from the earth through their removal from an open pit or borrow. Figure 8.8. Open-pit mine [16]. Surface mining is usually used to develop coal seams and deposits of many other minerals, but their feasibilities vary with the nature of the body ore.

## Dragline Excavators and Mining - Equipment & Contracting
How Dragline Excavators Are Used in Mining. Dragline excavators in mining are used to remove overburden - anything that's in the way of getting to the real product. For example, removing soil and rock from the surface above the coal seam. This overburden is repurposed, in some cases set aside to refill the open pit when the resources are
