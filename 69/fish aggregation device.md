Lower-cost moorings and programme management. Fish aggregating device (FAD) material prices sharply increased in the late 1990s and SPC was asked to conduct experiments on FAD buoy and mooring configurations to reduce cost and increase the life of FAD units. The results of these experiments are summarised in this manual.

## Modelling the impacts of fish aggregating devices (FADs) and fish 
Fish aggregating devices (FADs) are deployed to aggregate fish over a limited area to improve fish catch. Fish enhancing devices (FEDs), which are FADs deployed in no-fishing areas, are fast gaining popularity as a fisheries management tool in the western Pacific. Yet, the impacts of utilizing FADs and FEDs are not yet well understood.

## FAD: Fish Aggregating Device or Fish Attracting Device? A new analysis 
Because fish are easier to detect and to catch when around these objects, fishermen have extensively deployed a large number of artificial floating objects in the tropical oceans. Although such objects are referred to as Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), there is yet no strong evidence that fish do show an aggregative behaviour around them.

## Fish Aggregation Devices (FADs) - VR Fish
Fish Aggregation Devices (FADs) are man-made objects used to attract pelagic game fishing species such as yellowtail kingfish, southern bluefin tuna and dolphin fish. The use of FADs adds great value to our Victorian Game Fishing scene as they help to attract these open ocean going fish to a specific location and within easy access to boating

## Fish aggregating devices | Recreation, sport and arts | Queensland 
Fish aggregating devices. Fish aggregating devices (FADs) are human-made structures anchored offshore that attract fish, making them easier to catch so you can have a great fishing experience. To start with, 25 surface FADs were deployed off South East Queensland, from Fraser Island to the Gold Coast. These FADs have been popular with fishers
