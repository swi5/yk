## Coal-Fired Power - Analysis - IEA
In the first four months of 2021, the share was 66.5%, higher than in the same period in 2019 and 2020. In early 2021, coal-fired generation in India climbed to a monthly share of 79% of the power mix, the highest level since early 2019, as hydropower and wind availabilities were low and demand growth was met by coal-fired generation.

The UK average carbon footprint is about 10 tonnes CO 2 per person per year. This is about double the world average. It has fallen little since 1990. The UK government quotes a much smaller figure of about 6 tonnes CO 2 per person per year, but this excludes imports/exports, aviation and shipping. This misleading reporting is much criticised.
