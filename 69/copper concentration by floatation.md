## copper extraction concentration froth flotation
copper extraction concentration froth flotation. The froth of copperrich bubbles at the top of the tank is then skimmed off for further processing The gangue sinks to the bottom of the tank to be removed or disposed of as mine tailings The next stage after froth flotation is the thickening stage The froth is poured into large tanks called thickeners
