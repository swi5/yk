## Whats the difference between pliers and wrenches?
Whats the difference between pliers and wrenches? Asked by: Prof. Hazle DuBuque. Score: 4.8/5 (46 votes) Wrenches are designed to fit nuts, bolts and other standard fasteners.  Do not use pliers as a hammer. Do not hammer on pliers or wire cutters to cut wires or bolts. Do not extend the length of handles to gain greater leverage.

## Anti siphon hose bibbhnellweg-ma-hd
My garden hose bibb anti-siphon valve leaks badly. There is nothing wrong with the sillcock. I don't want to replace the sillcock. I only want to fix the leaking backflow preventer. There is NO set screw, and no place where a set screw was broken off.
