## Choosing and Troubleshooting Copper Electroplating Processes
Many non-cyanide copper processes operate between 54-65°C (°F) with air agitation. A typical bath formulation contains 11g/L of copper metal. The pH is around 9.0, while cyanide copper solutions have a pH of at least 11.0. The anode-to-cathode ratio is 2:1, with the same anodes used in cyanide copper solutions.
