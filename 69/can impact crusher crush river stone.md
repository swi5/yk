Secondary crushing: The coarsely crushed granite stone is sent to the cone crusher by the belt conveyor. 3.

A stone crushing plant is primarily involved in the manufacture of aggregates of various sizes (coarse aggregates, crusher run, rock sand and other fine aggregates) from basalt boulders. Coarse aggregates are usually used in ready mix concrete and asphaltic concrete. Crusher run is used for the bases and sub-bases for road making.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Impact Crusher | Description | Advantages - Engineering Intro
The word impact makes sense that in this particular type of crusher some impaction is being used for crushing of rocks. In normal types of crusher pressure is generated for the crushing of rocks. But, impact crushers involve an impact method. There is a hopper one side that takes the crushing material into the machine.
