Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## Iron Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Iron ore is regarded as the second most important commodity behind oil. As an essential input for the production of crude steel, iron ore feeds the world's largest trillion-dollar-a-year metal market and is the backbone of global infrastructure. To meet the growing demand for steel products, world iron ore production has increased

Ferrous metallurgy is the metallurgy of iron and its alloys.The earliest surviving prehistoric iron artifacts, from the 4th millennium BC in Egypt, were made from meteoritic iron-nickel. It is not known when or where the smelting of iron from ores began, but by the end of the 2nd millennium BC iron was being produced from iron ores in the region from Greece to India, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

## Materials | Free Full-Text | High-Efficiency Iron Extraction from Low 
Upgrading and utilizing low-grade iron ore is of great practical importance to improve the strategic security of the iron ore resource supply. In this study, a thermal analysis-infrared (IR) analysis-in-situ IR method was used to investigate the reaction mechanism and kinetics of Daxigou siderite. Experiments were conducted using a conveyor bed magnetization roasting process (CBMRP

## The Step-by-Step Process of Producing Iron from Iron Ore
The raw materials mix or "charge" enters the furnace from the top and hot air is blown or blasted from the bottom causing the coke to burn and the oxygen to combine with carbon in the coke to form carbon monoxide. Now, this carbon monoxide that is unstable, reacts with the ore to form carbon dioxide and iron. The Separation Of Iron-.
