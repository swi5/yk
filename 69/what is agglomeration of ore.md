The highly weathered nature of the ore in addition to its rather high clay content enabled easy mining in the oxide zone, but mandated agglomeration of the ore for successful heap leaching. Undersize from the crusher is conveyed back to the screen feed conveyor, joins the screen undersize, and drops into a Davis Pug Mill.

## Difference Between Agglomeration and Deglomeration
The key difference between agglomeration and deglomeration is that agglomeration is the process of aggregation, whereas deglomeration is the process of breakdown of aggregates.. Agglomeration and deglomeration are two chemical processes that are opposite to each other. Agglomeration refers to the formation of large masses via the combination of small masses.

Iron Ore Agglomeration Technologies. Until the 1950s of the last century, the oxidized iron ores that were loaded into the blast furnace had granulometries within 10 and 120 mm. However, the depletion of high-grade iron ore sources has made necessary the utilization of concentration processes with the purpose of enriching the iron ore.

## Novel Binders and Methods for Agglomeration of Ore
Agglomeration of ore into coarse, porous masses prevents fine particles from migrating and clogging the spaces and channels between the larger ore particles. Currently, there is one facility in the United States which uses agglomeration. This operation agglomerates their ore using leach solution (raffinate), but is still experiencing
