## Magnetite iron ore mining from the ground - Simurgh
In the initial stage, the ore must be condensed in several stages of operation, including: crushing, grinding, sifting, washing, using a magnetic separator, or by flotation. Concentrated solution usually contains 60 to 65 percent iron, 8 to 12 percent silica. After the ore is concentrated, it should be converted to sizes of 6 to 25 mm, which

## Processing of Magnetite Iron Ores - Comparing Grinding Options
There is a rich and long history of magnetite ore processing in Western countries, including large operations such as Cleveland Cliffs in the USA and LKAB in Sweden, as well as smaller operations like Savage River in Tasmania.  Application of more efficient grinding technologies developed in the last 20 years, including high pressure
