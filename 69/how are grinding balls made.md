After the parts are made, the ball bearing is ready to be assembled. To begin, the inner race is put inside the outer race, leaving space to insert the ball between the two. After inserting the number of balls necessary, the races are then centered and the balls are distributed evenly. Finally, the cage can be installed to hold the balls apart.
