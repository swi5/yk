## Temperature Reduction for Ball Mill Optimization | Lechler US
Heat taken away by ventilation systems can accounts for roughly 20% of the total heat discharged by the ball mill. Improving that ventilation system brings more cool air into the inside of the ball bill, gradually reducing the internal temperature. However, the major benefit of using ball mills is the product fineness they can deliver.

## heat generation from ball mill
This work is part of the OPTIMORE project and it focuses on the characterization of the heat generation of Tantalum ore during fracture by direct impact.Moreover quantify the heat energy loss to the environment during the grinding process of the ball mill. Furthermore, the density (2313kg/m3) and specific heat (853 J/kgK) of ore from Penolta
