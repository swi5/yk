## How Quartz Crystals Are Used In The Automotive Industry
The capability of quartz crystals to produce an electrostatic charge when force is removed or applied makes it useful in gauging force, strain or load measurements when a vehicle is in constant flux. Autos and water vessels benefit from quartz sensors' piezoelectric effect to measure strain on the transducers in these vehicles.
