Uses of Recycled Aggregate: - Building the base of a road. The underlying layer forms a structural foundation for paving. - Ready mix concrete. This is a mix of water, sand and cement. It can substitute for the brand-new aggregate. This includes uses for walkways, residential streets and concrete paving. - Stabilizing the soil.

The construction and demolition waste aggregates are classified by BS 8500 (2002). The code classifies this into two types as: The concrete aggregate that contains 95% of crushed concrete is called as recycled concrete aggregates. And if the aggregate used in the concrete is 100% crushed, it is called as recycled aggregates.

## A Brief History Of Concrete And Aggregate Equipment
The aggregate tools of 2500 BCE were made of iron, bronze, and wood (quite different from the jaw crushers and screening equipment we use today). How Concrete Built The Roman Empire. Concrete is a mixture of aggregate and cement. The aggregate can be fine sand, or coarse stone, depending on its usage.

Dec 12, 2021Eco-friendly. Recycled aggregates are considered ecologically beneficial and critical for the building industry's evolution and growth as it works to reduce its emissions. They are incredibly flexible due to their ability to imitate concrete and cement. Gravel mining consumes a large amount of resources and has a significant negative impact
