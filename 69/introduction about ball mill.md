Ball Mill an overview ScienceDirect Topics. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1-1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20-40% water by weight.

The term ball mill is restricted to those having a length to diameter ratio of 1.5 to 1 and less. Ball mills in which the length to diameter ratio is between 3 and 5 are designated tube mills. These are sometimes divided into several longitudinal compartments, each having a different charge composition; the charges can be steel balls or rods
