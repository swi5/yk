Overview: Conveyor systems are used to transport coal, granular carbon, and other often combustible materials from one area to another. Conveyor systems use conveyor belts, which are rolls of fabric or rubber pulled by motors along roller bearings to transport the material. These conveyors often run very long distances, requiring a multitude of
