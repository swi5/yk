## Primary Crusher And Secondary Crushers
The secondary crusher is mainly used to reclaim the primary crusher product. The crushed material, which is around 15 cm in diameter obtained from the ore storage, is disposed as the final crusher product. The size is usually between 0.5 and 2 cm in diameter so that it is suitable for grinding. Secondary crushers are comparatively lighter in

## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Hammer crushers are used either as a one-step primary crusher or as a secondary crusher for products from a primary crusher. They are widely used for crushing hard metal scrap for different hard metal recycling processes. Pivoted hammers are pendulous, mounted on the horizontal axes symmetrically located along the perimeter of a rotor.

Jaw crushers are mainly used in primary crushing stages and are rarely used for secondary crushing. As a compression crusher, this type of machine generally produces the coarsest material because it breaks the rock along its natural lines of weakness. Jaw crushers are an excellent primary stage solution to prepare rock for subsequent processing
