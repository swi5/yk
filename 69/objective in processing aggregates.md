## The Design Process: Objective or Subjective? | Toptal
Subjective (adj) - influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions. Using these definitions, we may surmise that design is primarily an objective process. To become successful as a designer, it is advisable we follow an objective process in a project's initial phase, rather than being influenced by emotions, "taste," hypotheses, and

## Theuid24
Onyejemezi (1988) defined instructional materials as resources or teaching materials, which a teacher utilizes in the course of presenting a lesson in order to make the content of the lesson understandable to the learner. This implies that the use of instructional materials is inevitable if effective teaching and learning must be achieved. 1.1.1.

TESTING OF AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE. Aggregate crushing value is an indicator of the crushing resistance of the aggregates when a compressive load is increased. It is tested in accordance with BS 812:110, 1990 and aggregate passing a 14mm test sieve and retained on 10mm sieve are considered for the testing. The allowable range is 17- 41.
