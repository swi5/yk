Marble is a mineral that is primarily comprised of calcite. Natural physical and chemical impurities add to this makeup, giving patterns and veining. Unlike marble, quartzite is not a mineral, it is made up of sandstone and quartz, both sedimentary rocks. Quartzite also takes on environmental impurities and inclusions, producing different colours.
