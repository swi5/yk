Iron is the most abundant metal in the world after aluminum. In fact, the earth's crust is made up of about 5% Iron. Iron ore was mostly used for smelting. Now Iron is used to make strong cutting tools, among other implements. Early tools such as hammer, knives, and swords were made using Iron. However, even today, the same tools are made

## Oxide Minerals - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A.C. Scheinost, in Encyclopedia of Soils in the Environment, 2005 Introduction. The oxide minerals typically present in soils comprise oxides, hydroxides, oxyhydroxides, and hydrated oxides of Si, Fe, Mn, Al, and Ti. With the exception of the Si oxide quartz and some Ti oxides, which are predominantly inherited from primary (rock) minerals, most oxides form in soil.

Magnetite is a form of iron oxide, Fe 3 O 4, which possesses uniquely iron in both the Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ oxidation states. Bearing the form of an inverse spinel, it's magnetic properties are highly valued. Addition of magnetite to soil is advantageous as it can later be removed easily by using magnets. It can occur naturally in soil, or be added as a soil treatment agent.

One of the major uses of silica sand is to make glass, and in particular glass bottles. The iron content is one of the major factors that affects the color of the glass. Low iron sands are used to produce clear glass for bottles, while sand with higher iron content is used to make amber glass bottles.
