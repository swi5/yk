Quartz. •••. Gold is most often found in quartz rock. When quartz is found in gold bearings areas, it is possible that gold will be found as well. Quartz may be found as small stones in river beds or in large seams in hillsides. The white color of quartz makes it easy to spot in many environments.

## Ordered monomolecular layers as a template for the regular arrangement 
In contrast, when gold is deposited on a pristine MoS2(0001) surface or on a molecular layer of stearic acid, the gold nanoparticles are randomly distributed on the surface. It is found that the arrangement of gold nanoparticles is largely determined by the deposition rate; faster deposition results in more ordered arrays of gold nanoparticles.

Gneiss ("nice") is a rock of great variety with large mineral grains arranged in wide bands. It means a type of rock texture, not a composition. This type of metamorphic was created by regional metamorphism, in which a sedimentary or igneous rock has been deeply buried and subjected to high temperatures and pressures.
