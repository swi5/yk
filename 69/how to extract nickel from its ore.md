## extracting nickel from its ore by reduction
metal Extraction of nickel from its ores Chemistry. Nickel can be extracted directly from its ore by reduction by hydrogen or carbon monoxide at elevated temperature at $600 mathrm{^circ C}$ to $650 mathrm{^circ C}$: $$ce{NiO + H2 -> Ni + H2O}$$ $$ce{NiO + CO -> Ni + CO2}$$ Also, it can be extracted by treatment with dilute
