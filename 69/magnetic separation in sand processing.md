## Quartz sand magnetic separation process
Quartz sand is a kind of non-metallic minerals, which can be widely used in the production of glass, metal silicon, organosilicon compounds, etc. in industry. Quartz sand is divided into natural sand and artificial sand. For natural sand, the beneficiation process is generally impurity removal - classification (desliming) - scrubbing - magnetic separation.
