Both countries produced marbles from these materials into the first quarter of the twentieth century. A number of Other Minera l spheres are available. Among the more readily available are Tigereye, Onyx, goldstone, malachite, snowflake obsidian, and quartz. Most of these are modern, although there are some antique handcut Tigereye marbles.

1.Size of Coarse Aggregates: The size of the coarse aggregate depends on the use of the concrete is to be poured. For large-scale concreting operations without complex reinforcement, large aggregates of size 80 mm, 40 mm, 20 mm are used. For the simple construction of residential or other buildings, 20 mm is the maximum size will be used.
