## Gender in Zambian Mining: Women in Nonmetalliferous Smallscale  - IJERT
The present research (Phiri, 2014) utilised concepts from Juliet Hunts 11-step Gender Analysis Framework to establish the theoretical and practicl sense of women participation in the non metalliferous small-scale mining sector in Zambia (Hunt, 2000). The framework was modified to four steps as shown in Table 1.

## Zambia's history of copper production — Part 1 - Mining For Zambia
Records of small-scale copper production date back to 1908 and 1911, when mining took place at Kansanshi and Bwana Mkubwa mines, respectively. Almost 100 years has passed since sustained commercial-scale mining began in Zambia, when extensive exploration projects led to the discovery of substantial copper deposits in the 1920s.

Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM) in Zambia is increasingly becoming an important source of employment for many who cannot get jobs in the formal sector. This sector is perceived by the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) as a potential source of tax revenue. ASM in Zambia has been habitually focused on the gemstone mining sector.
