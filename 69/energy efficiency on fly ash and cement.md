Silica.We've determined that one paver cut releases 45 million micrograms of dust into the air. But not all of that dust is silica.Our tests have shown an average silica content in masonry materials of +/- 20%. If 20% of that dust is silica, we can calculate silica by weight: 45,000,000  20% = 9,000,000 micrograms.

The concept of sustainable development can be traced to the energy (especially fossil oil) crisis and environmental pollution concerns of the 1960s and 1970s. The Rachel Carson book, "Silent Spring", published in 1962, is considered to be one of the first initial efforts to describe sustainable development as related to green building.

Coal fly ash is being used as part of the concrete design and specification because of its resistence to alkali reactivity and low heat of hydration. At the same time, the fly ash used in place of cement will prevent approx- imately 335,000 tons of greenhouse gases from being released.

The addition of rice husk ash to a concrete mixture has been proven to increase corrosion resistance. It has a higher early strength than concrete without rice husk ash.The rice husk ash forms a calcium silicate hydrate gel around the cement particles which is highly dense and less porous (Song, 1779).
