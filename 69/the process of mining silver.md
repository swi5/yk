## How Gold Is Mined | Gold Mining Process | World Gold Council
Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity - known as dor√© - typically containing between 60-90% gold.

## Lead Mining - Concentration process, flotation, filtering, roasting 
Lead is extracted from ores dug from under-ground mines. Lead is also found in conjunction with other metals such as silver and zinc. Lead materials are mined as a by- product of these other more valuable metals. Extracting the lead materials from the ore is a tedious process. First the lead ore is ground into small salt-like particles.

Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with water and steel balls.
