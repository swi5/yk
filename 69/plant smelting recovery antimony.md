12.11.2.2 Smelting - Smelting produces lead by melting and separating the lead from metal and nonmetallic contaminants and by reducing oxides to elemental lead. Smelting is carried out in blast, reverberatory, and rotary kiln furnaces. Blast furnaces produce hard or antimonial lead containing about 10 percent antimony.

Antimony Smelter. The largest antimony smelter in the world in 1945 was just north of Laredo in Webb County. Initially it had been at San Luis Potosí, Mexico, operated by a British firm owned by the Cookson family and founded in 1704. The duty placed on foreign antimony in the 1920s had encouraged domestic production to free the United States

The traditional method of producing antimony metal is through heat smelting. However, researchers at MIT claim to have accidentally stumbled upon a new method of smelting using electrolysis rather than heat. Research was funded by the US Department of Energy, the Advanced Research Projects-Energy (ARPA-E), and French energy company Total SA.

## Recovery of alkali, selenium and arsenic from antimony smelting arsenic 
Arsenic-alkali residue is a hazardous waste produced by the refining process of crude antimony in antimony smelting, and contains highly toxic sodium arsenate and a large number of residual alkali. In this study, aiming at the problems of the low recoveries and incomplete separation of arsenic and alkali, the secondary pollution of arsenic-alkali mixed salts and the insufficient utilization of
