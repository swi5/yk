## Benefits of Pelletizing Limestone - FEECO International Inc.
The limestone pelletizing process can be broken down into three steps: preconditioning, pelletizing, and drying. Preconditioning When pelletizing limestone, a preconditioning step is not required, but is often used, because it offers a wide range of benefits, including increased production, reduced binder requirement, and a more uniform product.

## What Happens When Limestone Is Mixed With Water? - Yes Dirt
Limestone is mostly made of calcium carbonate, with very low solubility in boiling water. If the limestone were crushed into a fine powder, it would dissolve because more surface area would be exposed to the hot water. If you put a piece of limestone (calcium carbonate) in hot water, it will dissolve similarly and dissolve in boiling water.
