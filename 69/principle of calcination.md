## Pyrometallurgy | Metallurgy for Dummies
Pyrometallurgy is a branch of extractive metallurgy. Pyrometallurgy Basic Principle. The basic premise of most pyrometallurgical operations is simple: high-temperature chemistry is employed to segregate valuable metals in one phase while rejecting gangue and impurities in another phase. In most instances, both phases are molten (such as the matte and slag in a conventional copper smelting

Apr 5, 2022Ans: In the roasting process, sulfide ore heats in the air and converts to metal oxide. But, in the case of carbonate ore, the moisture and carbonate are eliminated through the calcination process. Hence, roasting is inapplicable for carbonate ores. So, sulfide ores are roasted.
