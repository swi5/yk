## Ball Milling - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Ball milling is a mechanical technique that is broadly used to grind powders into fine particles []. The reactants are generally broken apart using solvent molecules in the traditional method; but in ball milling, reactants are broken by using mechanical forces. The term mechanochemistry has been introduced very recently [142].

One potential method is strengthening the internal and external ventilation of the grinder. Heat taken away by ventilation systems can accounts for roughly 20% of the total heat discharged by the ball mill. Improving that ventilation system brings more cool air into the inside of the ball bill, gradually reducing the internal temperature.
