## Limestone landscapes — Science Learning Hub
Limestone landscapes. Add to collection. Limestone is one of the most common sedimentary rocks found in New Zealand. Eye-catching features such as caves, sinkholes and spectacular skyline landscapes are often associated with limestone formations. These landforms have developed through the interaction of rocks, water and climate.

## What Does Acid Rain Do to Limestone? | eHow
As acid rain falls to the earth's surface, limestone rocks and limestone components in soil will react with the rain, neutralize the acid and dissolve. As the limestone dissolves, the rocks will wear away, becoming pitted with rounded edges. The dissolution process will change the appearance of the landscape as the rocks slowly wear away over time.

## The Formation of Stalactites and Stalagmites | HowStuffWorks
The water dripping from the end of a stalactite falls to the floor of a cave and deposits more calcite into a mound. Soon enough, a stalagmite will form in a conelike shape.

## limestone processes to
Limestone Production Process. As stated above, limestone can used in three forms and as a result the limestone will go though several processes. Here are the basic processes: quarrying of limestone, washing and selecting limestone for further uses, grinding of limestone, calcination of limestone, and slaking of quicklime.
