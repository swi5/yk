Heap leaching of gold and silver ores is conducted at approximately 120 mines worldwide. Heap leaching is one of several alternative process methods for treating precious metal ores, and is selected primarily to take advantage of its low capital cost relative to other methods. Thirty-seven different heap leach operations with a total production of 198 tonnes of gold per year (6,150,000 ounces

We forecast Chinese copper mine production to increase at an average clip of 1.3% per annum over, compared with an average growth rate of 6.9% over the past 10-year period. This slowdown in production growth will be driven by closures of low-grade copper mines in China and delayed planned capacity expansions.

## Chileanemeinschaft-wesermarsch
The mid-March assessment by the battery supply chain research outfit shows that battery-grade lithium carbonate (EXW China, â‰¥99.5% Li2CO3) is averaging $76,700 a tonne, up 10% over just two weeks. The absence of a clear pricing signal, particularly a futures reference price, itself adds to the unpredictability of lithium supply.

## Calculation of Ore Tonnage & Grade from Drill hole Samples
The area influenced by any given hole is found as follows: (1) Divide angle at hole by 180Â°. (2) Multiply total area of entire prism by above result. (3) Multiply area found by (2) by the average thickness (found by solution of the formula) of ore in the hole, which thus transforms this smaller prism into volume.
