## Froth Flotation Method - JXSC Machine
The froth flotation method is widely used to treat various veins of gold and silver ores for the following reasons: (1) In most cases, the froth flotation process can enrich gold and silver in sulfide concentrate to the greatest extent and discard a large number of tailings, thus reducing the smelting cost.

## 4 Nickel Sulfide Froth Flotation Processes and 2 Common Reagents
Nickel sulfide ore generally contains copper, so it can also be called copper-nickel sulfide ore. This type of ore is mostly magma-melted copper-nickel ore. When the nickel content is above 3%, it is called rich ore and can be directly smelted. When the nickel content is less than 3%, it needs to be purified by beneficiation method. At present, the most common method is flotation.

## 60 Centuries of Copper: The Flotation Process
The powdered product of grinding the ore is fed into a series of tanks called flotation cells which are filled with a solution containing various oils capable of forming a froth. Air is pumped into each cell, the solution being agitated to bring froth of bubbles to the surface. In the case of copper minerals, the particles adhere to this froth

## Froth flotation
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.

## Froth Flotation Process - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Jan 20, 2021"The single most important method used for the recovery and upgrading of sulfide ores", that's how G. J. Jameson described the froth flotation process in 1992. And it's true: this process, used in several processing industries, is able to selectively separate hydrophobic from hydrophilic materials, by taking advantage of the different categories of hydrophobicity that are increased by
