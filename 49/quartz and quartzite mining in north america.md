## Quartzite
Quartzite is a hard, non-foliated metamorphic rock which was originally pure quartz sandstone. Sandstone is converted into quartzite through heating and pressure usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts.Pure quartzite is usually white to grey, though quartzites often occur in various shades of pink and red due to varying amounts of hematite.

Quartzite is a metamorphic rock derived from sandstone that is distinguished from sandstone by its fracture. Sandstone breaks along grain boundaries, whereas quartzite is so well indurated (hardened) that it breaks across constituent grains. The intense heat and pressure of metamorphism causes the quartz grains to compact and become tightly

It has a simple chemical formula (SiO 2) but is very stable and resistant retaining its identity even billions of years after its formation, extreme weathering and, transport. Quartz (Fig. 1) has always played a large role in human technology.

## Quartzite - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The quartzite forms in regional metamorphism of feldspar and quartz sandstone, siltstone, chert, and rarely in quartz-rich pegmatite veins. The metamorphic transformation of the primary quartz dominated sedimentary rocks (e.g., sandstone) into quartzite is usually caused by high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, usually related to tectonic movement and compression within orogenic belts.

## Quartz vs. Quartzite Countertops | CounterTop Guides
The resin used in manufacturing quartz countertops is a plastic, so it is prone to melting in heat above 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Where quartz has an advantage over quartzite is that it is less prone to denting and chipping because it is more flexible. Both countertop materials can be scratched by sharp objects, and a cutting board should be used.
