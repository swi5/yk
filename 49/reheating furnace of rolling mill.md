## Integrated Scheduling of Reheating Furnace and Hot Rolling  - Hindawi
Abstract. In the hot rolling mill, a cold slab is reheated in reheating furnace and then rolled into thin coils through hot rolling process. Traditional research on hot rolling mill generally takes the two processes as two separate single-objective scheduling problems, though they are closely connected and their optimization objectives are conflicting with each other.

## Heating of Steel in Reheating Furnace - IspatGuru
The reheating furnace heats the charged steel material to the rolling temperature for its hot rolling in the rolling mill. Rolling temperature is that temperature which makes the steel charge suitable for the plastic deformation in the rolling process. For this, the steel is to have temperatures where its microstructure is in the austenitic range.
