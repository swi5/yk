## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

The beneficiation of low grade banded iron ores has now become mandatory due to a depletion of high grade ores. Many iron ore companies in India are now considering setting up beneficiation plants to recover the iron values from banded ores. The challenge is that the banded ores are liberated at fine sizes—below 100 μm.

Central (1). Toddlers who eat a well-balanced diet, with enough iron sources included, also do not need any supplementation either. Poor iron content in children can lead to distracted focus and causes them to feel tired and weak. So, try to incorporate at least a couple of iron-rich food into your baby's daily diet.

## Recovery of Iron values through conventional beneficiation techniques 
Background/Objectives: Due to soaring demand and rapid depletion of high-grade iron ores, lean grade iron ores of India like BHJ and BHQ needs to be utilized through suitable beneficiation techniques.Methods: Banded Hematite Jasper (BHJ) sample of Bonai-Keonjhar belt (BK belt), Odisha, India assayed 35.3 % Fe, 47.1% SiO2 and 0.96% Al2O3 was investigated in respect of mineralogy, liberation
