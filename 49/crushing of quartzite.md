## Quartzite: Metamorphic Rock - Pictures, Definition & More - Geology
Quartzite can be an extremely durable crushed stone that is suitable for use in the most demanding applications. Its soundness and abrasion resistance are superior to most other materials. Unfortunately, the same durability that makes quartzite a superior construction material also limits its use.

## Quartzite Countertops | Quartzite Slabs | MSI Quartzite
Quartzite is a very hard metamorphic rock that originated as sandstone. Through a process of high heating and pressurization sandstone is transformed into Quartzite, an extremely strong and durable natural stone. When heated, individual quartz pieces recrystallize giving it a beautiful and decorative sparkling pattern.
