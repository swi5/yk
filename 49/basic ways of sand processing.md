Sand Casting. Sand casting means the production processes that need sand as the main molding material, it also means the casting products made by these processes. 1. Casting Process. We need make wooden, resin or metal patterns according to the drawings or samples. Then, we put patterns into the sand boxes, then put green sand or resin sand

The basic function of the sand is to remove the mosses and to increase the immunity of the grass, by acting as a fertilizer. The ingredients of the lawn sand stick to the leaf surface of the mosses and weeds. In this way, the leaf structure is disturbed and the unwanted plants are eventually killed.

Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. Casting materials include metal, concrete, epoxy, plaster, and clay. This article will focus on sand casting. The versatility of the sand casting process is well recognized.

## basic ways of sand processing
it is still common to process gravel simply by screening to a maximum top size.A great benefit is gained from processing the material by crushing. This means that a good percentage of the stone will be fractured in the crushing process.The broken stones will embed into the surface of a gravel road much better than rounded, natural-shaped stone.

There are two basic methods of casting a bronze. Sand casting is a simple technique that uses moulds made of compact, fine sand. Lost-wax casting is a complex process using wax models.

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.
