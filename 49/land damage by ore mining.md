Surface Mining. The largest mines are usually surface mines. Heavy machinery and blasting procedures are used to remove large amounts of surface rock, which significantly disturbs the land. A typical surface mine can produce up to 150,000 tons of ore every day. Sometimes whole mountains (or tops of mountains) are removed via surface-mining
