## Rare Earth Mining Equipment In Australia
Nov 26, 2020 Australia and the US have made it clear they are worried about rare earths supply in particular because the resources are needed in leading-edge technology, including guided missile systems and other defence equipment. The entire global rare earths industry is worth less than US4 billion a year. Which isnt much.

## Rare earth mining Australia - minerals and mining companies
Jun 21, 2022Introduction to Rare earth elements. The global demand for rare earth elements is growing. Australia is the 4 th largest producer of rare earths in the world, and it holds 3.4% of the worlds rare earth resources. As critical minerals, rare earths elements processing is a new industry, which makes rare earth projects riskier compared to lithium projects which have a well-documented history.

## What Are Rare Earth Metals? What Are They Used For? - Tech Metals Research
Rare earths are also used as a refiner in gas used to fuel internal combustion engines. Rare earth magnets, like that of Neodymium-iron-boron, are used in sensors, and even ferrite magnets contain small amounts of rare earths and minor metals like Lanthanum and Cobalt to improve magnet performance by as much as 25%.

## Rare Earth Elements, China, U.S., minerals, critical materials 
Rare Earths in Australia Must Be About More Than Mining. REEs are a group of 17 metalsâ€”15 elements from the lanthanide series and two chemically similar elements, scandium and yttrium. Each has unique properties vital for a range of commercial and defense technologies, including batteries, high-powered magnets and electronic equipment.
