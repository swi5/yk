## Gradation and Size - Pavement Interactive
The particle size distribution, or gradation, of an aggregate is one of the most influential aggregate characteristics in determining how it will perform as a pavement material. In HMA, gradation helps determine almost every important property including stiffness, stability, durability, permeability, workability, fatigue resistance, frictional resistance and moisture susceptibility (Roberts et

The grading of an aggregate can be measured by what proportion of the aggregate, by mass, passes through different sized sieves. The grading of an aggregate can be altered by blending multiple aggregates of different gradings.

## Aggregates - Cement
Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. After harvesting, aggregate is processed: crushed, screened, and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.

Aggregates of different grain sizes for testing. From left to right: manufactured sand of 1-1.25 mm and 4-5 mm, fine aggregate of 10-12.5 mm and 20-25 mm. The general idea is that the smaller the aggregate size, the more we need equipment to produce it. Production of aggregate starts typically from 800 mm pieces of blasted material.

At a given water ratio, within the range employed in most structural concrete, smaller maximum sizes of aggregate will tend to produce higher concrete strengths than larger ones. 2. The larger sizes will require less mixing water and hence, for a given cement factor, will produce concrete of lower water-ratio than the smaller sizes. 3.

## What is Aggregates | Aggregate Definition & its Types. - CivilSeek
In the Fine Aggregates, the grain-size lies between 4.75 mm and 0.15 mm. In other words, these pass-through from sieve with the mesh size of 4.75 mm and are retained on a sieve of 0.15 mesh size. Sand is the most universally available natural Fine Aggregate. (ii) Coarse Aggregates:

Source: ASTM Standard C33/C33M The second column in the table shows the aggregate size range that is always decided prior to use. For example, if we are to prepare a concrete mix using an aggregate sample that contains a maximum particle size of 63mm and a minimum particle size of 37.5mm, we'll look through the second row and the values present in the columns will brief the proportion of a

2. In general the aggregate is filler material and smaller aggregate leads to a stronger mix (there are lots of other variables) 3. This will depend on gradation (well graded vs poorly graded) 4. Not sure. 5. Yes. Around here a 3/8" 4000 psi mix is generally $10 more per yard than a 3/4" 4000 psi mix.
