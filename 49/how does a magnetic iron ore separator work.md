## Pules Electric Magnetic Iron Ore Separator | Handan Zhuofan Mining 
How does it work? Nowadays, the drum separator is used in the iron ore mining industry. But it can not produce high-grade iron concentrate because it can not remove the locked-particles and gangue in the agglomeration formed in the process of magnetic separation. The RY series Pules Electric Separator works in a better way.

RUDN researchers have created and tested a method for processing titanium dental implants. It turned out that theanoslos of graphene on the surface of titanium improve its interaction with stem cells,which are placed on the implant so that it better "takes root".Thanks to this method ofprocessing, stem cells are better kept on the surface, multiply and turn into the desired cells.

In the laboratory, colloidal magnetite Fe 3 O 4 (or similar magnetic material such as maghemite γFe 2 O 3 or ferrites) particles usually are surface-modified by silanisation. Naked iron oxide (Fe 3 O 4) has the capacity of adsorbing DNA (Davies et al. 1998), but aggregates due to attractive forces reduce the surface area that can be used for adsorption.Silane compounds coupled to magnetite.

## How Does a Belt Type High Gradient Magnetic Separator Work? - gtek
Magnetic System: The belt-type high-gradient magnetic separator adopts the extruded flat magnetic system. The magnetic system is composed of high-quality NdFeB magnetic material and magnetic poles. The magnetic poles are also used as magnetic conductive media, which can generate large magnetic field strength and gradient on the surface. 2.
