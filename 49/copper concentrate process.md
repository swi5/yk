## Outotec copper concentrate pressure leaching process
The Copper Pressure Oxidation Plant is an Outotec proprietary technology for impure concentrate refining. The new process offers an effective way to dissolve concentrate, remove impurities, and recover copper as LME A-grade cathodes. In addition, the flowsheet can be modified to recover silver and gold. It is an easy-to-operate, self-optimizing

The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.

A process flow diagram based on roasting with sodium chloride (or carbonate) and subsequent water leaching is presented. The chemistry of sulfide interaction with salt additives is described. The effect of the roasting temperature on copper and molybdenum distribution among the process products was studied

## New Technology Uses Salt Or Brackish Water To Process Copper Concentrate
September 29, 2016. Flotation froth of copper concentrate during laboratory testing in Santiago, Chile. Barrick has developed and patented a new flotation process that can produce copper concentrates from copper or copper-gold ores using salt or brackish water. The new process, an air-metabisulfite treatment, does not require lime or cyanide.

## Handling guide for copper concentrate in bulk
Although copper occurs naturally in a pure state, it s primarily mined from the minerals chalcopyrite, bornite, and malachite. Copper ore is extracted form the earth, then converted into copper concentrate, which is then roasted, smelted and converted into refined copper. The resultant metal is widely used for its high electrical and heat

## copper processing | Definition, History, & Facts | Britannica
copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes. Consequently, it is
