## Graphite facts - NRCan
Graphite facts. Graphite is a non-metallic mineral that has properties similar to metals, such as a good ability to conduct heat and electricity. Graphite occurs naturally or can be produced synthetically. Purified natural graphite has higher crystalline structure and offers better electrical and thermal conductivity than synthetic material.

## Graphite | Energy & Mining
Graphite. Graphite, the hexagonal crystalline form of carbon, occurs naturally as disseminated crystal flakes in high-grade metamorphic rocks, as veins, and as microcrystalline 'amorphous' graphite associated with metamorphosed coal seams. The major market for graphite is in the production of heat resistant 'refractory' linings where it
