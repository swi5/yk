## While there may be a small drop in
While there may be a small drop in price, we expect the price of steel overall to remain flat into the 2nd quarter of 2022 based on the state of the steel market today. This is because there is still a strain on steel supply on a global level. As imported steel is starting to come into the US more, it will help with the overall steel shortage.

How Steel Is Made. Steel is primarily produced using one of two methods: Blast Furnace or Electric Arc Furnace. The blast furnace is the first step in producing steel from iron oxides. The first blast furnaces appeared in the 14th century and produced one ton per day. Even though equipment is improved and higher production rates can be achieved
