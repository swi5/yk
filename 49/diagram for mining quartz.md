## The Quartz Page: Quartz Structure
To get an idea of quartz crystal structure and its symmetry properties, most figures show the crystal when viewed in the direction of either the a-axis or the c-axis (a and c in Fig.1.01). This corresponds to a projection of the atoms onto the a-plane and the c-plane, and not to a slice of the crystal: the atoms one sees actually lie in different planes along the a- and the c-axis.

Shaft mining is a form of underground mining where shafts are pushed vertically from top to bottom to excavate the ores and minerals. It is also called shaft sinking. It is best suited for concentrated minerals such as iron, coal, etc. which can be found at the depth of the earth's surface. It is found mostly all over the world.

The term epithermal was coined to describe a relatively shallow deposit. It comes from the Greek word "epi" meaning shallow, while "thermal" refers to the heated fluid necessary for the deposit's formation. There are two main types of epithermal gold deposits: low sulphide and high sulphide (Figure 1). Figure 1: Diagram showing low

## Quartz Mineral | Photos, Uses, Properties, Pictures - Geology
Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.
