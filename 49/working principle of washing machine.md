Sep 21, 2021What Is The Working Principle Of Washing Machines. Since washing machines come in various designs, shapes, and sizes, some features may differ from machine to machine; however, almost all washing machines more or less have similar basic parts. They include a watertight container called the tub, with a drum fitted inside it to hold the washing.

The working principle of a washing machine is the centrifugal and centripetal forces. Washing machines operate in two primary cycles. These are the wash cycle and the rinse cycle. The wash cycle involves the principle of centrifugal force. The direction of this force is from the inside to the outside, which ensures that every part of the fabric

Jan 14, 2022The outer drum is held to the frame of the machine by heavy-duty springs. That's because, when the clothes spin, they can make the drum shake violently; the springs help to absorb the vibrations. Hot and cold water enter through the detergent tray at the top. The inner drum turns back and forth.

The working principle of an alternator is very simple. It is just like the basic principle of DC generator.It also depends upon Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction which says the current is induced in the conductor inside a magnetic field when there is a relative motion between that conductor and the magnetic field.

## The working principle of a washing machine is A Reverse class 11 
So, we can say that the working principle of the washing machine is centrifugation. Correct answer is option (C) Note: A body moving on a circular path has two forces acting on it. One is centripetal force and the other is centrifugal force. A body moving in a circular path will constantly change direction and hence will change velocity.
