## Fall of ground management in shallow underground hard rock mining: a 
Abstract: Rock fall related hazards will forever be present in the mining industry, therefore it is considered important to have an active fall of ground (FOG) management technique that will help combat such incidents. The Chrome mine has experienced numerous falls of ground incidents in the previous years. This was a major concern, as there

## Quick Guide to Hard Rock Mining | An Underground Miner
Jan 28, 2021Hard rock mining is a process that includes various techniques of excavating minerals from hard rock - especially those that contain metals such as silver, gold, iron, zinc, copper, lead, tin, and nickel. This process also involves the same techniques while excavating large ore bodies containing gems such as rubies and diamonds.

The normal stresses of mining can exceed the uniaxial compressive strength of soft rock even at shallow depths, and excavations based on criteria accepted in hard rock mining inevitably fail. Instead, such excavations must be modified to allow the controlled yielding and displacement available with alternative mining methods.

Hardrock minerals are things like copper, gold, iron, lead, silver, but also uranium. Back in the 1800s in an effort to encourage westward expansion, the General Mining Act of 1872 gave public minerals to individuals or mining companies for free and required no environmental protections or cleanup standards when the mining was complete.

Hard Rock Mining. Starting at the early exploration stage, a geologist must begin spending time, energy and capital right away. Expensive and potentially many deep drill holes must be punched into the ground. After months of analyzing the drill data, if promising results are inferred, the best case scenario is more drilling. The goal is either
