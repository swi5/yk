Grinding takes an abrasive — often attached to a wheel — and uses its many grains to cut a workpiece. Variations on this process are useful for a wide variety of applications. On its surface, grinding seems simple: a machine takes a rotating tool (usually a wheel) with abrasive grains and applies it to a workpiece's surface to remove

## Electrochemical Grinding: Definition, Parts or Construction, Working 
The working principle of electrochemical grinding is When a metal surface is acted upon with an electrolyte under a high current, the metal surface gets oxidized to form an oxide layer (corrosive layer). This layer is removed with the action of a flowing electrolyte and rotating grinding wheel.  Grinding Machine: Definition, Parts, Working

## Centerless grinding
Working principle. In centerless grinding, the workpiece is held between two wheels, rotating in the same direction at different speeds, and a workholding platform. One wheel, known as the grinding wheel (stationary wheel in the diagram), is on a fixed axis and rotates such that the force applied to the workpiece is directed downward, against the workholding platform.

Surface Grinding Machine is a machine in which a grinding wheel is used as a cutting tool for removing the material from the surface of the workpiece. It is also called an abrasive machining process where abrasives are placed on the surface and corners of the grinding wheel so as to do the finishing process with much more accuracy.
