We recommend you use a mini loader with a bucket to move large amounts of crusher dust around your job site. If you have the option, use a levelling bar attachment to quickly and evenly spread the material around. Again wet it. Wetting the crusher dust not only reduces the amount of dust in the air but also allows for a firmer compaction rate.

By nature of the product, crusher dust is easy to work with, spread, and level out. As the material settles, the dust and smaller pieces fill the gaps between larger pieces of stone, creating a smooth and compact surface. The material is tightly packed, which means there is no shifting, no moving, and no potholes developing over time.
