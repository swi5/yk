## The Complete Collection of Copper Beneficiation Reagents
Ester-105: It has selectivity and foaming property to reduce the cost of reagents and improve the mineral processing index. DMDC: It has a strong collection capacity for copper and a weak collection capacity for pyrite and unactivated sphalerite. It can be used for copper and sulfur separation and its flotation index is higher than butyl xanthate.
