## What is Milling?- Definition, Process, and Operations
Oct 18, 2021Milling is the process of machining using rotating cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece. Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty group milling operations. It is one of the most widely used processes of machining custom parts with precise

Once the stock is positioned, it is locked into a vise for safe and easy movement.
