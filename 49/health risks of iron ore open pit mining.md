## Potential ecological and human health risks of heavy metals in surface 
The hazard quotient (HQ) and cancer risk indicated that the pathways for the risk to occur were found to be in the order of ingestion > dermal > inhalation. Overall, findings showed that some metals and metalloid were still present at comparable concentrations even long after cessation of the iron ore-mining activities.

## The Potential Negative Effects Of Mining On The Environment, Animals 
In some countries, mining is responsible for significant amounts of water use, as well as water waste. Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants.

## Mining Problems and Possible Solutions - Tasmanian Times
The overburden from an open pit mine (the world's preferred mining method) sometimes reaches five times the mass of minerals removed for processing. Overburden is piled near the mine and can become unstable and dangerous. Some overburden mountains are as high as 200m and can be poisonous to ground water and animal life.

Most iron ore mining operations use the 'open pit' method, where miners drill into the rock and blast the ore-bearing material loose with explosives. Huge excavators are then used to gather the loosened ore. To mine metallurgical coal, which will later be turned into coke, it's usually necessary to sink vertical mine shafts to access coal

## Health Risks Of Iron Ore Open Pit Mining
Open pit mining, where material is excavated from an open pit, is one of the most common forms of mining for strategic minerals. This type of mining is particularly damaging to the environment because strategic minerals are often only available in small concentrations, which increases the amount of ore needed to be mined.

## Adelaide Research & Scholarship: Iron-ore dust and its health impacts
Abstract: Different lung diseases including lung cancer are the major occupational diseases among the workers of iron ore dust. However, health hazards that arise due to exposures to the ore dust vary considerably due to its variable composition in different mines. Iron oxide and silica predominantly contribute to its toxicological properties.

In-situ mining techniques can use less water than open-pit mining and underground mining, and also reduce the risk of releasing ore dust into the atmosphere. In 2011, SRK commenced a pre-feasibility engineering study for Andes Iron's Dominga project in Chile. The study was completed in late 2013, based on a 95ktpd iron ore mine with two pits.
