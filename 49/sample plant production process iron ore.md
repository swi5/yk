## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets, or fines) into iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Direct reduction refers to solid-state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting

There are two main processes for producing steel: by means of a blast furnace (= indirect reduction) in combination with a converter, or by means of an electric furnace. In the former process, iron ore is the main raw material. In an electric furnace, scrap iron is used and occasionally also sponge iron. Sponge is an intermediate product, which

In 1991, these facilities produced 4.5 million tons of primary aluminum. 12.1.2 Process Description 2-3 Primary aluminum production begins with the mining of bauxite ore, a hydrated oxide of aluminum consisting of 30 to 56 percent alumina (A l2O3) and lesser amounts of iron, silicon, and titanium. The ore is.

##  88 Iron Ore - Usgs
ore mines (each with associated concentration and pelletizing plants), and three iron metallic plants—one direct-reduced iron (DRI) plant in Louisiana and two hot-briquetted iron (HBI) plants in Indiana and Texas—operated during the year to supply steelmaking raw materials. The United States was estimated to have produced 1.9% and consumed
