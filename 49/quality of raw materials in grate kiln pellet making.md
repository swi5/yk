## Model and simulation of heat transfer, magnetite oxidation and NOx 
The induration of magnetite pellets is a complex physico-chemical process that involves oxidation, sintering, and heat transfer. The thermal- and gas-composition profile that is experienced by the pellet in an induration reactor could result in the formation of a homogenous or heterogeneous pellet structure, which could affect the pellet quality.

## Wood pellet-free-marburg
Wood Pellet Making Process Deisgn at Low Cost. Raw Materials Pretreatment; The production of wood pellets begins with the generation of the raw material. In most cases this raw material is a byproduct of some other wood processing operation, like clean (no bark or dirt), dry sawdust and small scrap blocks etc. and there are also producer using wood logs to make.

The first thing that you will need to do is to make sure that the can is cut open and that the lid is left attached. Then make a hole in the lid. Next, place the pellets in the can, making sure that they fill the can about a third. Then tilt the can, ensuring that the lid is closed. Masterbuilt MB Digital Electric Smoker, 30 inch, Black

## Predictive models and operation guidance system for iron ore pellet 
This model was primarily developed for static heat hardening of pellets on moving grate. For grate-kiln system, pellet temperature profiles within two devices can be estimated by the coupled model proposed in this study, and residence time on the grate can be obtained via moving speed while residence time in rotary kiln can be estimated by Eqs.
