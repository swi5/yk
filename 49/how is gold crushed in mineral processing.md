2. Ancient placer gold ore. The ancient placer gold ore is the petrified placer ore, which is composed of the petrolized gravel. The particle size of 80% ore is between 75-100 microns. And this type of ore has a high grade. Gravity separation and cyanidation is a better process for gold extraction.

Gold, recognizable by its yellowish cast, is one of the oldest metals used by humans. As far back as the Neolithic period, humans have collected gold from stream beds, and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C., when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry, religious artifacts, and utensils such as goblets.

## gold processing - Mining and concentrating | Britannica
The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below). These heaps can be
