## block caving (mining) | SpringerLink
block caving (mining) [ It involves the undercutting of large blocks of ore. The settlement, following undercutting, causes crushing and fracturing of the ore. As broken ore is drawn off the block settles continuously and subsidence eventually extends to the surface. Ore is drawn off at the bottom of the blocks until cap rock, or overburden

## Block Caving
Overview. Block caving is an underground hard rock mining method that involves undermining an ore body, allowing it to progressively collapse under its own weight. It is the underground version of open pit mining. In block caving, a large section of rock is undercut, creating an artificial cavern that fills with its own rubble as it collapses.

## Block caving: A new mining method arises | Geoengineer
Block caving is an underground hard rock mining method that involves undermining an ore body, allowing it to progressively collapse under its own weight. It is the underground version of open pit mining. In block caving, a large section of rock is undercut, creating an artificial cavern that fills with its own rubble as it collapses.
