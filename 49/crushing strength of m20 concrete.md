## Concrete Mix Design Calculation - M20, M25, M30 - Procedure & Example
Concrete Mix Design Calculation for M20, M25, M30 Concrete with Procedure & Example. Concrete mix design is the process of finding right proportions of cement, sand and aggregates for concrete to achieve target strength in structures. So, concrete mix design can be stated as Concrete Mix = Cement:Sand:Aggregates.
