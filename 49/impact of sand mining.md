Excessive instream sand mining is a threat to bridges, river banks and nearby structures. Sand mining also affects the adjoining groundwater system and the uses that local people make of the river. Instream sand mining results in the destruction of aquatic and riparian habitat through large changes in the channel morphology. Impacts include bed

Mining Contributes To Global Warming Natural resources extracted through mining contribute heavily to global warming. Coal and oil are burned to power cars and our electric grid, releasing dangerous CO2 into the environment. Beyond being fueling these processes, mining itself creates a lot of pollution.

## Environmental impact assessment of sand mining from the small  - PubMed
This, in many of the occasions, has resulted in indiscriminate mining of sand from in-stream and floodplain areas leading to severe damages to the river basin environment. The case is rather alarming in the small catchment rivers like those draining the southwestern coast of India due to limited sand resources in their alluvial reaches.

## The Negative Impact Of Sand Mining On The Environment
Local sand mining is leading to the destruction of aquatic habitats by the dramatic change in channel morphology. Impacts include bed lowers, bed cramps, lowering of water tables near streambed, and channel instability. These physical effects cause riparian and aquatic biota damage and can lead to damage to bridges and other structures.

## The Impact of Sand Mining on the Environment and social  - GAINAKO
Inland sand mining has an impact on biodiversity and habitat, deforestation of the land with the consequent elimination of the vegetation, pollution of the land, hydrology, air and even noise. Because of these impacts, local communities are the one that tend to bear the negative impacts of sand mining be it social, economic or environmental.

Human activities also have a major impact on rock. Mining, of course, changes the location and condition of rocks and soil. Acid rain caused by pollution can eat away at rocks and minerals. Soil: Formation and erosion. Under steady state, erosion rates are equal to soil formation rates. The fastest rates of soil formation occur in dune sands in
