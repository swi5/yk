## Carbonized limestone
The burning of limestone in the cement-making process liberates carbon dioxide gas (formula CO 2). Limestone is used in the manufacture of three kinds of lime that have a wide range of uses. Aglime is simply pulverized limestone. It is used as a soil conditioner to neutralize acidity and to add calcium and magnesium nutrients. Quicklime is.

Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
