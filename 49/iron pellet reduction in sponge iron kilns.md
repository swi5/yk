## Blast furnace
The main chemical reaction producing the molten iron is: Fe 2 O 3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO 2. This reaction might be divided into multiple steps, with the first being that preheated air blown into the furnace reacts with the carbon in the form of coke to produce carbon monoxide and heat: . 2 C (s) + O 2(g) → 2 CO (g).

Direct Reduction Process. DRI is also known as sponge iron, it is a solid-state direct reduction process Fig 26 Coal, dolomite and iron ore or pellets are fed into one end of a rotary kiln, while sponge iron and char are withdrawn from the other end Primary and secondary airs are supplied to the kiln to initiate combustion and reaction processes Choudhury, 2014 .
