Steel-making is the practice of producing steel from iron ore and scrap. In steel-making, contaminants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, silicon, and excess carbon are removed from the sourced iron, and alloying elements such as manganese, nickel, chromium, and vanadium are added to produce different grades of steel.

## Steelmaking
Steelmaking has played a crucial role in the development of ancient, medieval, and modern technological societies. Early processes of steel making were made during the classical era in Ancient Iran, Ancient China, India, and Rome.. Cast iron is a hard, brittle material that is difficult to work, whereas steel is malleable, relatively easily formed and a versatile material.

## Iron- and Steel-Making Process | SpringerLink
Iron is extracted in the form of metallic iron (Fe) by reducing the oxide ores with a reducing agent. The principal agents commonly employed to serve this reduction process are the naturally occurring forms of carbon such as coke, charcoal and coal. In order to extract the iron, Fe (55-60%)-rich ore is usually used.

Pig iron, an intermediate form of iron produced from iron ore and is subsequently worked into steel or wrought iron 10. Uses: Traditionally pig iron would be worked into wrought iron in finery forges, and later puddling furnaces, more recently into steel. In these processes, pig iron is melted and a strong current of air is directed over it

At this point, the liquid iron typically flows through a channel and into a bed of sand. Once it cools, this metal is known as pig iron. To create a ton of pig iron, you start with 2 tons (1.8 metric tons) of ore, 1 ton of coke (0.9 metric tons) and a half ton (0.45 metric tons) of limestone. The fire
