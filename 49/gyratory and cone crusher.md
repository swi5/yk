## Cone Crusher Explained - saVRee
Cone Crushers; Typically, the initial crushing stage is completed using either gyratory crushers or jaw crushers. It is often the case that there will be only one crusher installed, and this will be referred to as the primary crusher. Cone crushers are more often used for 2nd, 3rd & 4th stage crushing steps (although not always).

## How does gyratory crusher work?s
How does a gyratory cone crusher work? Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h.

## Gyratory And Cone Crusher Are The Same In South Africa
Gyratory Crushers - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy. Feb 17, 2016 Essentially, the gyratory crusher consists of a heavy cast-iron, or steel, frame which includes in its lower part an actuating mechanism (eccentric and driving gears), and in its upper part a cone-shaped crushing chamber, lined with wear-resisting plates (concaves).

## Difference Between Standard and Short Head Cone Crusher
The standard cone crusher has a large head angle, coarser discharge and higher output. It is generally placed behind the rough crusher (jaw crusher or gyratory crusher) for medium crushing. The head angle and the size of the discharge port of the short-head cone crusher are relatively small, and a finer product size can be obtained.
