If you choose to operate a small scale recycling plant, then a 50 sq. feet room can also work. But if you choose a large scale recycling plant, then at least 200 to 500 sq. feet of land is required for the recycling process.

These by-products are not useful for plants and are stored in barks, stems leaves the plant parts. These parts shed off after some time. Main excretory product of the plant is oxygen and carbon dioxide. Sometimes resins are mixed with gums.These are called gum resins.
