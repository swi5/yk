Palm kernel shell as one of the by-products accruing from oil palm pro-cessing can be suitably converted to renewable energy to meet the de-mand of the ever-growing population of fuelwood and charcoal (Agyei et al., 2019). Palm kernel shells as a form of renewable energy have not been adequately investigated in Ghana; therefore, this project

Feb 3, 2022Palm kernel shell (PKS) is a by-product in palm oil milling during the extraction of crude palm oil from fresh fruit bunches. PKS is a promising solid fuel to replace coal with its high calorific value. As Japan is moving towards renewable power to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, importing biomass as fuel sources is trending. In the past decade, PKS has been imported extensively into Japan
