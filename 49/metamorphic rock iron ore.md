## What Is The Difference Between Igneous Metamorphic And Sedimentary Rocks
Metamorphic Rock - Forms when pressure temperature or chemical processes change existing rock. Igneous Rock - forms when magma or lava cools and hardens to become solid. Sedimentary Rock - Form when minerals that form from solutions or sediment from older rocks get pressed and cemented together.

Metamorphic rocks, and the processes that create them, are key parts of the rock cycle that relates igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. Most metamorphic rocks form when heat, pressure, or chemically reactive fluids cause changes in preexisting rocks (Figure 8.2). The preexisting, or parent rocks, are called protoliths.

## What Is The Difference Between Igneous Metamorphic And Sedimentary Rocks
Igneous rocks are derived from molten material (magma or lava). Sedimentary rocks are derived from sediments of pre-existing rocks fossils and tiny pieces of animal remains. Metamorphic rocks are derived from other rocks. Igneous rocks are formed when molten material from volcanoes cools down and solidifies.

## Metamorphic Rocks - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Metamorphic rock is the result of the transformation of an existing rock type, the protolith, in a process called metamorphism. The protolith is subjected to heat and pressure causing profound physical and chemical change. The protolith may be sedimentary rock, igneous rock, or another (older) metamorphic rock.

## Sub-pixel Mapping of Copper- and Iron-Bearing Metamorphic Rocks Using 
Mapping of metamorphic complexes using remote sensing technology is essential for searching metallic and nonmetallic ore deposits (Kotnise and Chennabasappa 2015).Many of the largest deposits of base and precious metals are located in metamorphic terrains (Spry et al. 2000) which are important geological features in orogenic systems (Eskola 1948; Teyssier and Whitney 2002).

## Metamorphic rock
Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock to new types of rock in a process called metamorphism.The original rock is subjected to temperatures greater than 150 to 200 °C (300 to 400 °F) and, often, elevated pressure of 100 megapascals (1,000 bar) or more, causing profound physical or chemical changes.During this process, the rock remains mostly in the solid state, but
