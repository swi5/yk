## What is the purpose of sieve analysis conducted on aggregates used for 
The aggregates are graded as per IS code 383, when the aggregate size is less than 4.75mm is called fine aggregate & more than 4.75mm is called coarse aggregate. The aggregate gradation is determined by the fineness modulus method where aggregates are passing through the sieve as per IS standard to classify its size.

## INTRODUCTION AGGREGATE AND SIEVE ANALYSIS.pdf
INTRODUCTION AGGREGATE AND SIEVE ANALYSIS • Aggregate is a raw material used in construction to produce concrete or mortar for example sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag, recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Aggregates are used broadly in the construction because it ' s strengthen the composite material and it is affordable. • Aggregate gives higher volume stability and better
