## Prediction of power consumption and product size in cone crushing 
An investigation of the parameters affecting the performance of laboratory scale cone crushers is presented. This work forms part of a rock characterisation initiative undertaken by Pegson Ltd. and the Camborne School of Mines. The effect of feed size, closed side setting and rock strength on the power consumption and product size is examined.

## Crushing Energy & Work of Crushing Machines
W = Pf/2 = P²L/2AE = A²S²L/2AE = S²/2E x AL. When P/A = S. If, to simplify the mathematics of the demonstration, we assume the particle under load a cube of edge D, then A = D 2, L = D, S 2 /E is an assumed constant, and. W = S²/2E x D³. or the work of deformation is proportional to the volume of the particle deformed.
