## A Guide on Keeping Limestone Driveway Clean & Polished
1. Use a pressure wash. Because liquid limestone is porous, spores, bacteria, and algae have a chance to develop and ruin the exquisite look of your driveway. Along with a high-pressure wash, treat your limestone driveway with a mixture of water and chlorine. This will kill off any unwanted microorganisms that could potentially stain the limestone.

A major component in concrete is cement, and the manufacture of cement is one of the world's largest producers of carbon dioxide. Cement is made by taking limestone, which is mostly calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), and heating it.That produces calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2).And since heating limestone takes a tremendous amount of energy, carbon dioxide is also released by whatever.

At a high level, limewash is essentially crushed limestone that is combined with water to make a wash. It's a method that's been around for centuries. When applied to a porous surface (like brick), it creates a chalky, matte finish. In the picture above I've only applied one coat, but you can apply multiple coats for a more opaque finish.
