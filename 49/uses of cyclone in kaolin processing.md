## Kaolin in the Paper Industry - Focus on the Asian Region
An example of the extensive processing of kaolin is found in those products intended for the paper industry. The greatest demand for kaolin-based pigments comes from the paper industry, which uses them to coat and fill papers and boards. There are many ways to produce these pigments. One of the methods used is the water washed process.

## Production Process - kaolin
Firing is the most important manufacturing process stage, because, when the semi-hardened elements travel through the kiln, they undergo fundamental transformations in their physico-chemical properties. The processed pieces are subjected to a high-temperature thermal cycle up to 1300 C. The length of the kiln can be more than hundreds of meters.

Kaolin can satisfy the world demand for filler, paper and ceramic industries. Kaolin converts to a pozzolan material named metakaolin (MK) after suitable thermal treatment. MK can be used in mortar and concrete to improve their properties. In addition, MK can be used as a source of cementing materials in alkali activation or geopolymer.
