##  PREFACE - United Nations Development Programme
Energy savings were approximately 25% in furnace oil using units and exceeded 40% in coal using units. UNDP along with MoS and supported by AusAID, has launched a new project to upscale the energy efficiency measures in steel rerolling and other subsectors. The project titled "Upscaling Energy Efficient Production in Small Scale Steel

## Iron and Steel - Analysis - IEA
The steel sector is still highly reliant on coal, which meets 75% of its energy demand. The energy intensity of crude steel needs to decline by 0.2% annually during 2020‑2030 to attain the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario level. While energy efficiency is important for Net Zero by 2050 alignment, on its own it cannot decarbonise the sector.
