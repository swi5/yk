## Open-pit Mining - Mining North Works
Open-pit mining occurs on surface and is generally the cheapest way to extract ore. This is because rock doesn't have to be moved far up hill against gravity, equipment used can be larger than underground, and it doesn't require more expensive features like ventilation, communications, etc. that underground does.

Open-Pit Mining. SANDEEP YADAV B.E. MINING VIIIth SEM.. Description. Open-pit mining is surface mining in which huge portions of earth are dug from the surface to extract the desired mineral within them. During the mining process, the land face is scraped away by explosives and digging creating a deeper and deeper pit until the mining is complete. The final shape of the open pit is decided

More useful is to look at the mining industry in general. Statista reports that, in 2020, the United States had the following active mines: 6,251 sand and gravel pits, 4,281 stone quarries, 1,009 coal mines, 895 nonmetal mines, and 278 metal mines. Sand, gravel, stone, coal, and many of the metal and nonmetal mines are likely to be of the open pit type.

Open-pit mining, or open-cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth, such as long wall mining. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful minerals or rocks are found near the surface; that is, where

## Open Pit Mine Planning and Design - Micromine
Open Pit Mine Planning and Design: Step two. Produce a solid wireframe of the pit. The pit shell solid represents the shape and volume of material that will be excavated throughout the life of mine. At this stage, Interactive Wireframe Boolean can be used to boolean the pit DTM against a topographic surface to create a pit shell solid.

Among the major concerns about open-pit mining are the change in landform, the generation of an acid mine drainage, and the deprivation of water supply. All these, however, can be reversed, mitigated, if not totally avoided, with the proper engineering solutions, using advances in technology. One example of a mining project that meets the law
