Gypsum outcrop in Clark County. Gypsum is an evaporite because it precipitates (settles) out of water as the water evaporates. the three varieties of gypsum are selenite, satin spar, and rock gypsum. Selenite, found throughout the Red Hills, has flat, diamond-shaped crystals that can be split into thin sheets.Satin spar is white or pink and fibrous with a silky luster.

No gypsum deposits are 100% pure. It is usually found with deposits of a combination of the following: limestone, sand, shale, anhydrite and sometimes rock salt. To be a commercial deposit, gypsum content should be at least 75%. The first mining of gypsum in North America was in Nova Scotia about the year 1770.

## Macro-Microscopic Deterioration Behavior of Gypsum Rock after Wetting 
Gypsum rock is highly sensitive to a water environment due to its unique physical and chemical properties, such as high solubility. After wetting, the internal microstructure of gypsum rock is damaged, and the mechanical properties deteriorate accordingly, leading to serious engineering problems for gypsum-bearing geotechnical structures. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to investigate

Jan 28, 2021Hard rock mining is a process that includes various techniques of excavating minerals from hard rock - especially those that contain metals such as silver, gold, iron, zinc, copper, lead, tin, and nickel. This process also involves the same techniques while excavating large ore bodies containing gems such as rubies and diamonds.
