The linear vibrating screen uses an inertial vibration exciter to generate vibration, and its vibration source is a motor belt.Dynamic exciter, the exciter has two shafts, each shaft has an eccentric weight, and in the opposite direction.It is also called double-shaft vibrating screen, which is meshed by two gears to ensure synchronization.

Use multiple vibrators: For more extensive pours, you will want to attach several vibrators. That way, you can ensure complete agitation of the concrete and dissolve all air bubbles. Space the vibrators about 6 feet apart for best results. Be sure the formwork can vibrate freely: The concrete formwork will need to vibrate sufficiently.
