## Grinding process
Grinding is the process of removing metal by the application of abrasives which are bonded to form a rotating wheel. When the moving abrasive particles contact the workpiece, they act as tiny cutting tools, each particle cutting a tiny chip from the workpiece.  For wet grinding, flood the wheel with coolant when you dress or true it. For dry

## Wet Grinding | Custom Milling & Consulting LLC
Wet Grinding, also known as wet milling, is a process of taking materials in a liquid form or slurry and reducing particles, such as agglomerates, by breaking them apart or shearing them down in size. Since the early 1800's companies have manufactured machines that were engineered to process wet materials. As time went on people formulated
