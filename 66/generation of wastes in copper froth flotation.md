## Effect of Collector & Frother Concentration on Copper Flotation
This increases the froth overflow and flotation rate, but, unfortunately it also decreases the concentrate grade. Collector concentration has a significant effect (either linear or non-linear) on all three quantitative response variables. As collector concentration increases, recovery increases until a maximum is reached (=93%), after which a

## Froth flotation
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.

## Environmental Performance Assessment of Froth Flotation for Coal 
In the two stage flotation process developed at the University of Cape Town, froth flotation is used to both recover coal (stage 1) and remove pyritic sulfur (stage 2) from ultrafine coal waste, resulting in three outputs streams: a saleable coal product, a small volume sulfide-rich stream, and a reduced volume sulfide lean tailings stream.

## Froth_flotation
Froth flotation. Froth flotation is a selective process for separating minerals from gangue by using surfactants and wetting agents. The selective separation of the minerals makes processing complex (that is, mixed) ores economically feasible. The flotation process is used for the separation of a large range of sulfides, carbonates and oxides
