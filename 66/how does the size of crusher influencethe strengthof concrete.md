Retaining Walls. Layering crushed concrete is also a great way to create a retaining wall and control erosion on slopes or hills in your yard. Different sizes of crushed concrete can function together to help prevent erosion. A layer of smaller, more broken-up crushed concrete as a base will contribute to the stability of the wall.
