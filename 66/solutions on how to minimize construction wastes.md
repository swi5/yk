Types of Construction Wastes and Recycling Strategies. 1. Brick. Brick wastes are generated as a result of demolition, and may be contaminated with mortar and plaster. Brick wastes are sometimes blended with other materials like timber and concrete. Currently, bricks are recycled by crushing and using as filling materials.
