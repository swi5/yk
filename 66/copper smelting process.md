## Smelting - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Ramesh Singh, in Applied Welding Engineering (Second Edition), 2016. Smelting. Smelting is an energy-intensive process used to refine an ore into usable metal. Most ore deposits contain metals in the reacted or combined form. Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite (αFeO[OH]), limonite (the generic formula for limonite is FeO[OH].nH 2 O), and siderite (FeCO 3) are iron ores, and

## How does a copper smelter work? Explained by FAQ Blog
May 30, 2022How does the smelting process work? Smelting is a form of extractive metallurgy to produce a metal from its ore. Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gasses or slag and leaving just the metal behind.The reducing agent is commonly a source of carbon such as coke, charcoal, and coal.

smelting, process by which a metal is obtained, either as the element or as a simple compound, from its ore by heating beyond the melting point, ordinarily in the presence of oxidizing agents, such as air, or reducing agents, such as coke. The first metal to be smelted in the ancient Middle East was probably copper (by 5000 bce), followed by tin, lead, and silver.

## Copper extraction
Copper sulfide and iron oxide can mix, but when sufficient silica is added, a separate slag layer is formed. Adding silica also reduces the melting point (or, more properly, the liquidus temperature) of the slag, meaning that the smelting process can be operated at a lower temperature. The slag forming reaction is: FeO + SiO 2 → FeO.SiO 2

## Is Green Smelting Possible? | Wood Mackenzie
The vast carbon emissions from steel and aluminium production often overshadow the environmental impact of zinc, lead and copper smelting. But the energy-intensive process of producing these metals is far from squeaky clean. So, is 'green' smelting possible, and what are the obstacles to making it happen? Visit the store to read Is green

## USA - Copper smelting process - Google Patents
There is disclosed a copper smelting process. At first, blister copper is produced in a blister copper-producing facility. Then, the blister copper is caused to flow through blister copper launders into one of anode furnaces, and refined into copper of higher quality in the anode furnace. In the refining operation at the anode furnace, the receiving step and the oxidizing step are carried out

## The SKS Copper Smelting Process In China - OneMine
The SKS copper smelting process was jointly developed by Shuikoushan Mining Corp. and ENFI (Beijing Central Engineering and Research Institute for Non-ferrous Metallurgical Industries) in China. It is a new bath copper concentrate smelting process with oxygen enriched air. The pilot plant testwork was completed successfully in 1993.
