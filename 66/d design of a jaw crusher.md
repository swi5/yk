For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

## Optimization Design of Vibratory Jaw Crusher with Double Cavities Based 
The vibratory jaw crusher with double cavities was designed for reducing energy consumption by more crushing and less grinding. The dynamic model is established based on its structural characteristics, and the standard state equations are built by using Lagrange method. Based on MATLAB, the trajectory diagrams of the moveable jaws in the two cavities are obtained by Range-Kutta method.
