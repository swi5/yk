## What Are the Basic Principles of Cylindrical Grinding?
Grinding this part reduces the intensity of the friction it will be subjected to. The shaft therefore becomes more durable and reliable. Cylindrical grinding is also used in areas with particularly high technical requirements. Many industrial machines have ground parts, as do the vast majority of engines.

## Centerless grinding
Working principle. In centerless grinding, the workpiece is held between two wheels, rotating in the same direction at different speeds, and a workholding platform. One wheel, known as the grinding wheel (stationary wheel in the diagram), is on a fixed axis and rotates such that the force applied to the workpiece is directed downward, against the workholding platform.
