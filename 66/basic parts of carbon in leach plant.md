## Modeling and optimization of Carbon in leach (CIL) circuit for gold 
The CIL process concentrates gold from 2.5-3.5 g/t in ore to 2000 to 6000 g/t on carbon. Although the earliest process was in South Africa in 1890, CIP/CIL was first introduced in gold processing in 1949 at San Andreas (Honduras) (Marsden and House, 2006). As the ore grades have deteriorated from around 12 grams per tonne in 1950 to nearly 3

The CIL facility, which kick-started initial trial production on November 6, will enable CNMC to extract and process at least 500 metric tons per day (mt/d) of higher-grade ore at its flagship Sokor gold field in Kelantan. Construction of the plant began in May and was completed within the budget of RM25 million ($3.8 million).

Photorespiration can drain away as much as 50% of the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle on a hot, dry day. Certain plant species have evolved alternate modes of carbon fixation to minimize photorespiration. C4 plants first fix CO2 in a four-carbon compound. Several thousand plants, including sugarcane and corn, use this pathway.
