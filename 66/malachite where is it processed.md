## Is Malachite Poisonous? Is It Toxic To Touch? - You Are My Magic
Raw Malachite is quite poisonous as it contains copper minerals in a very high percentage ( approximately 58% ). Copper is toxic to humans and it affects the formation of red blood cells and hence Malachite dust should not be ingested, inhaled, or left on the skin. This is the reason Malachite is well polished and cleansed before it can be used.

It is important to know that most malachite stones and jewelry meant to be handled or worn are sealed, meaning that the raw stone cannot touch your skin. Malachite is high in copper, and that copper can be toxic to humans. When a stone is broken, usually there will be unsealed edges of the copper rich malachite available for your skin to touch.
