Figure 4: Sweeping machine. Batch Plant. Batch plants, which produce HMA in individual batches, are the older of the two types of HMA production facilities; it was not until the 1970s that drum plants became a popular HMA production option. Typical batch quantities range from 1.5 to 5 tons of HMA and each batch can take 15 - 45 seconds to make.

Machine Lubrication With Water-Based Fluids: Use Additives, Mixing and the Right Water. Many oil-based fluids have been replaced by vegetable oils and water-soluble cutting fluids. All coolants, however, contain additives that enhance lubricity, inhibit rust and (most) bacteria growth, or reduce foaming.

The iron ore is smelted out to form pig iron, the raw and purest form of iron. The pig iron is usually distributed in the form of ingots. Pig iron is then combined with other elements such as carbon, chromium, etc. to obtain materials like cast iron, steel, and alloy steel. Steel plants do the job of separating the pig iron from the iron ore.
