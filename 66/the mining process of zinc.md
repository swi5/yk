## mining mining process of zinc
Zinc mining is the process by which mineral forms of the metal zinc are extracted from the earth through mining. A zinc mine is a mine that produces zincminerals in ore as its primary product. Common co products in zinc ores include minerals of lead and silver. Other mines may produce zinc minerals as a by product of the production of ores
