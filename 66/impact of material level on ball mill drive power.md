## Energy Efficiency Analysis of Copper Ore Ball Mill Drive Systems - MDPI
3. Analysis of Variant Ball Mill Drive Systems. The basic element of a ball mill is the drum, in which the milling process takes place ( Figure 1 ). The length of the drum in the analyzed mill (without the lining) is 3.6 m, and the internal diameter is 3.4 m. The mass of the drum without the grinding media is 84 Mg.

## Impact mill
Impact mills pulverize the material upon impact. The feasibility of impact mills was greatly enhanced by the mechanization and engineering of the Industrial Revolution. Prior to the industrial revolution, milling was primarily done by attrition or grinding the material between two surfaces. [1] Attrition milling continues to be the dominant
