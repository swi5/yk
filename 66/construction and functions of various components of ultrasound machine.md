1) Resistor. Resistor with symbol. A resistor is an electrical component that regulates or restricts the flow of an electrical current in a circuit. This can also be used to provide a specific voltage to a transistor. When current flows through the resistor, the electrical energy is absorbed by the resistor and dissipated in the form of heat.

INTRODUCTION. A diagnostic ultrasound machine consists of many components, each of which has a separate operation to perform. This starts with transmitting and receiving ultrasound signals which are then processed to form the images that we see on screen. The internal components that make up a typical ultrasound machine are listed below.

One of the most common uses of ultrasound is during pregnancy, to monitor the growth and development of the fetus, but there are many other uses, including imaging the heart, blood vessels, eyes, thyroid, brain, breast, abdominal organs, skin, and muscles. Ultrasound images are displayed in either 2D, 3D, or 4D (which is 3D in motion).

Ultrasound Machine is a very useful test to visualize the structure of the heart and achieve the study of its hemodynamic functioning (its ability to pump blood). It is possible to accurately diagnose cardiac, acquired or congenital conditions. With an ultrasound, cardiac conditions can be classified according to their intensity and origin.

Dec 22, 2020An ultrasound transducer converts electrical energy into mechanical (sound) energy and back again, based on the piezoelectric effect. It is the hand-held part of the ultrasound machine that is responsible for the production and detection of ultrasound waves. It consists of five main components: crystal/ceramic element with piezoelectric properties.

## Application of Ultrasound in Medicine - PMC - PubMed Central (PMC)
The development of real-time system led to, even, to the possibility of the continued visualization or the ultrasound fluoroscopy . In the ultrasound diagnostics can be differed two techniques : transmission and reflection. Transmission technology is based on distinguishing the tissues with different absorbance of ultrasound.
