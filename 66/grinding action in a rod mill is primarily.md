Rod Mills Introduction. Rod mills are widely applied in cement industry, chemical industry, new building materials, fire-resistant materials, fertilizer, porcelain and glass industry etc.. Rod mill Grinding are grinding machine which employ high carbon steel or special steel rods of nearly the same length as that of the drum, in place of steel balls in ball mills.

## Rod Mills - SolidsWiki
Rod mills usually require greater operator attention. It is important that the rods stay essentially parallel to one another. If rods become misaligned, grinding action is lost and, more importantly, rod tangles occur. Maximum rod length is limited to about 6.1 m (20 ft). This in turn limits the length, diameter, and capacity of rod mills.

The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill, similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill. To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling, the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6. Rod mills accept feed up to about 50 mm (2 in.) and produce a product in the size range of 3000 to 270 mm (-4 to -35 mesh).

The grinding action of a rod mill is line contact. As material travels from the feed end to the discharge end it is subjected to crushing forces inflicted by the grinding rods. The rods both tumble in essentially a parallel alignment and also spin, thus simulating the crushing and grinding action obtained from a series of roll crushers.

As such, when the product is sticky, rod mills are preferred over ball mills. Rod mills have an industrial yield that is less than that of a ball mill, which explains the fact that balls have a much larger grinding surface than rods. The power needed to operate a rod mill could exceed 30% of the power used in a ball mill.
