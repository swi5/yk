## Dolomite | Common Minerals
In sedimentary dolostones, dolomite is most often associated with calcite, aragonite, gypsum, anhydrite, chert, and halite. Vein deposits of dolomite occur with quartz and other common vein minerals, such as calcite, magnesite, fluorite, siderite, and sphalerite, or with metallic ore minerals such as galena, pyrite and chalcopyrite.

Description. Dolomite is a calcium magnesium carbonate mineral which has many characteristics similar to calcite. In places where access to limestone is not available or more costly, dolomites are used in its place for the basic materials from which most building stone and a significant percentage of crushed stone are produced.

## Dolomite (rock)
Dolomite (also known as dolomite rock, dolostone or dolomitic rock) is a sedimentary carbonate rock that contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2.It occurs widely, often in association with limestone and evaporites, though it is less abundant than limestone and rare in Cenozoic rock beds (beds less than about 66 million years in age).
