## on used belt conveyor calculation
Belt Conveyor systems are the most versatile and simplest material handling systems. They work with two or more pulleys driving an endless loop belt. The loop then moves a product from Point A to Point B on the belt. We use belts made from fabric or rubber. Belt conveyors are commonly used in both manufacturing and distribution facilities. Read

## How to Calculate Load Carrying Capacity of Conveyor Rollers?
Calculating load on conveyor roller is simple arithmetic and very easy. Assume that you have to design a Gravity Roller Conveyor System for carton box conveying. Weight of the carton box is 50kg Length of the box is 400mm Width of the box is 300mm Lets Calculate width of the rollers = width of the carton box + 50mm So Roller length is 350mm Now we have to decide how many rollers will be below
