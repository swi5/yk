THE BLAST FURNACE IRON PRODUCTION. A typical blast furnace may be up to 32 metres in height and 10 metres in diameter They have thick steel sides, lined with refractory bricks, to ensure that heat is not lost Blast furnaces are used continuously and are only shut down when their brick lining needs replacing As the mixture of iron ore, coke and limestone heats, the hot waste

## Iron Ore Processing Plant With 50 Years Experiences
The HIsarna steelmaking process is a process of primary steelmaking in which iron ore is processed almost directly into steel. The process is based on a new type of blast furnace called a Cyclone Converter Furnace, which makes it possible to skip the process of manufacturing pig iron pellets, a necessary step in the basic oxygen steelmaking

## Iron Making in Mini Blast Furnace (MBF)
The products from mini blast furnaces are of the same quality as that of normal Blast Furnaces and are free of tramp elements - this is of particular advantage in steel making in mini steel plants. Use of 40 - 45% hot metal in EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) charge has thus become standard practice, which has helped to reduce the power consumption in Electric Arc Furnaces to 380 - 400 kwh/t liquid

## What's the Process of Iron Smelting? - Meetyou Carbide
Reduction of iron. In blast furnace, iron is not directly reduced from high valence oxide, but through a process of reduction from high valence oxide to low valence oxide, and then from low valence oxide to iron: Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe. The reduction of iron mainly depends on carbon monoxide gas and solid carbon as reducing agent.

A blast furnace is a steel cylinder lined with refractory. It operates continuously until the lining wears out, which takes many years to occur. The term blast furnace comes from the blast of hot air that is blown into the lower part of the furnace at between 1400º to 2100ºF. Molten iron is produced in a blast furnace by the following steps: 1.

A "DR-grade" pellet typically has higher iron content and less silica, alumina and other gangue constituents than "BF-grade" pellets.

## How steel is made - a summary of a Blast Furnace
To make steel, iron ore is first mined from the ground. It is then smelted in blast furnaces where the impurities are removed and carbon is added. In fact, a very simple definition of steel is "iron alloyed with carbon, usually less than 1%." Blast furnaces require many auxiliary facilities to support their operations.

The purpose of a blast furnace is to chemically reduce and physically convert iron oxides into liquid iron called "hot metal". The blast furnace is a huge, steel stack lined with refractory brick, where iron ore, coke and limestone are dumped into the top, and preheated air is blown into the bottom. The raw materials require 6 to 8 hours to

## Evolution of Blast Furnace Iron Making - IspatGuru
Evolution of Blast Furnace Iron Making. The origin of the first smelting of iron is concealed in the unrecorded history of human civilization. The first evidence of iron implements being used in ancient times actually comes from Egypt where an iron tool was found in a joint between two stones in a pyramid. The origin of many prehistoric iron
