## Why Should We Reduce The Use Of Plastic - Almost Zero Waste
Reducing the use of plastic is essential because plastic production requires an enormous amount of energy and resources. This causes carbon emissions and contributes to global warming. Recycling plastic is inefficient - only 9% of plastic ever produced has been recycled. Instead, about 60% is discarded in landfills and oceans.

The plastic grinding machine is used to grind flexible or rigid materials with or without water.. The grinder placed under the screw press is used to obtain a better dry on the film. The material heated by friction and in some cases partially melted, falls in the grinder where it is reduced in size and in the meantime the moisture is removed by thermal exchange.

Polyethylene production - Neuman & Esser. Polyethylene is the most widely used plastic worldwide. Polyethylene is produced from high-purity ethylene by the high-pressure process using traces of oxygen or peroxides at pressures of 1,500 to 3,800 bar and temperatures of 100 to 200°C in stirred autoclaves or tubular reactors.

## Plastic recycling
Plastic recycling is the reprocessing of plastic waste into new products. When performed correctly, this can reduce dependence on landfill, conserve resources and protect the environment from plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Although recycling rates are increasing, they lag behind those of other recoverable materials, such as aluminium, glass and paper.
