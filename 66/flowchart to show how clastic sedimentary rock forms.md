Sedimentary rock types Conglomerates and breccias. Conglomerates and breccias are sedimentary rocks composed of coarse fragments of preexisting rocks held together either by cement or by a finer-grained clastic matrix.Both contain significant amounts (at least 10 percent) of coarser-than-sand-size clasts. Breccias are consolidated rubble; their clasts are angular or subangular.

The characteristics and distinguishing features of clastic sedimentary rocks are summarized in Table 6.2. Mudrock is composed of at least 75% silt- and clay-sized fragments. If it is dominated by clay, it is called claystone. If it shows evidence of bedding or fine laminations, it is shale; otherwise it is mudstone.

## Clastic Sedimentary Rocks - Arizona State University
Clastic Sedimentary Rocks. Clastic sedimentary rocks are made up of pieces of other rocks. For example, sand on a beach or in a dune can get buried. Under the pressure of burial, the sand is pressed together and compacted. The individual sand grains are glued together by minerals such as calcite (calcium carbonate) and hematite (iron oxide

Rock Flow Chart by Dean Nguyen on Prezi. Sedimentary rocks begin when wind or rain break off pieces of rock and then the rocks are then transported to the bottom of mountains or the bottom of oceans. The deposited rock then sits there for over thousands and thousands of years. Each deposited rock is in its own layer.
