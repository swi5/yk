## TENORM: Copper Mining and Production Wastes - US EPA
Copper mining waste piles may be as large as 400 hectares and typically include three types of waste: Tailings (33%). Dump and heap leach wastes (28%).  (39%). Some of the copper mine wastes have been put to use, but on a limited scale. Mixtures of crushed waste rock, including waste rock from the copper mines, have been used to construct

## Chapter 4: Mining waste - SGU
The ratio of waste rock/ore is called stripping ratio. For example, a stripping ratio of 2:1 means that 2 tonnes of waste rock needs to be removed to mine 1 tonne of ore. Generally, an open pit mine has a higher stripping ratio than an underground mine. Waste rock is often deposited in piles or heaps close to the mine to minimize transports.

## Mining
Ore, for processing, and waste rock, for disposal, are brought to the surface through the tunnels and shafts. Sub-surface mining can be classified by the type of access shafts used, and the extraction method or the technique used to reach the mineral deposit.  The largest and second deepest open-pit copper mine in the world is Chuquicamata

Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors..
