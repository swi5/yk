As you can see in the example above, the deposit does not have to be enormous in size (only 500 meters long by 100 meters wide) to contain a valuable deposit (approximately $6 billion worth of minerals). However, in order to be as realistic as possible about this valuation, you can not assume that the complete ore body contains the same grade (i.e. 2% copper and 1.5 gram per tonne gold).
