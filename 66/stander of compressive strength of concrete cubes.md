Like the cylinder break test, the concrete cube test is performed for the purpose of determining the compressive strength of a concrete element. The cubes used for this test have a dimension of 150 x 150 x 150 mm as long as the largest aggregate does not exceed 20 mm. Generally speaking, the cubes are cured for and tested at 7 and 28 days

Compressive Strength of concrete = Maximum compressive load carried by specimen / Cross Sectional Area surface of specimen. Take it as, Cross sectional Area = 150mm X 1500mm = 22500 mm 2 or 225 cm 2. Assume the compression load is 400 KN, Compressive Strength = (400000 /22500) = 17.77 /9.81 = 181.22 kg/cm2. Note - 1 kg is equal to 9.81 N

Concrete compressive strength for general construction varies from 15 MPa (2200 psi) to 30 MPa (4400 psi) and higher in commercial and industrial structures.Compressive strength of concrete depends on many factors such as water-cement ratio, cement strength, quality of concrete material, quality control during the production of concrete, etc. Figures 1 and 2 present a comparison between some

## stander of compressive strength of concrete cubes
Sep 26, 2016¬∑ It is also important to know that the measurement of compressive strength is widely accepted as the best test for the quality control of fresh concrete. How to Measure Compressive Strength of Concrete. Testing concrete cylinders and cubes is the most widely used test for measuring the compressive strength. []
