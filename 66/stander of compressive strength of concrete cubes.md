Compressive Strength of concrete = Maximum compressive load carried by specimen / Cross Sectional Area surface of specimen. Take it as, Cross sectional Area = 150mm X 1500mm = 22500 mm 2 or 225 cm 2. Assume the compression load is 400 KN, Compressive Strength = (400000 /22500) = 17.77 /9.81 = 181.22 kg/cm2. Note - 1 kg is equal to 9.81 N

Concrete compressive strength for general construction varies from 15 MPa (2200 psi) to 30 MPa (4400 psi) and higher in commercial and industrial structures.Compressive strength of concrete depends on many factors such as water-cement ratio, cement strength, quality of concrete material, quality control during the production of concrete, etc. Figures 1 and 2 present a comparison between some

Sep 26, 2016· It is also important to know that the measurement of compressive strength is widely accepted as the best test for the quality control of fresh concrete. How to Measure Compressive Strength of Concrete. Testing concrete cylinders and cubes is the most widely used test for measuring the compressive strength. []
