## Environmental impact assessment (EIA) of hard rock quarrying in a 
The increase in demand of building stones and construction-grade sand has resulted in aggressive hard rock quarrying in many parts of the world. The problems are to be evaluated in detail for the judicious use of resources on the one hand and ensuring health of the ecosystems on the other. The present study aims to evaluate the impact of hard rock quarrying on one of the important twin - river

crushed rock aggregate involves the process of mining known as quarrying and it also has some environmental impacts such as noise pollution as a result of explosives and heavy machineries, the production of fines which pollutes the air and causes several other problems to man and his environment.

Common rock types in the study community have a wide range of crushability (i.e. the ease with which a rock is crushed). The table 1 shows a number of rock types and their relative crushability. As one can see, rocks with high amounts of quartz are harder than those with no or little quartz and thus require considerable effort to crush.
