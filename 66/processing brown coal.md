## From a humid swamp to a cooler climate - how Latrobe Valley's brown 
About Latrobe Valley brown coal. About 430 billion tonnes of brown coal reserve is located in Victoria. Eighty percent lies in the Gippsland Basin. Brown coal is made up of partially decayed plant trunks, branches and stems, leaves, bark, and seed. It's typically low in ash, sulphur, heavy metals and nitrogen, and contains a moisture content

A 24-ton-per-day (tpd) pilot plant was built in 1978 at Rheinbrau's brown coal processing plant at Frehen, Germany (near Cologne). Later, in 1996, a demonstration plant was built at Berrenrath, Germany (Figure 3), and operated for over 10 years, and supplied syngas for methanol production.

## Learn About Wyoming Coal Mining.
Coal. Wyoming, the nation's leading coal producer since 1986, provides about 40% of America's coal through the top 10 producing mines located in the Powder River Basin. Most Wyoming coal is sub-bituminous, which makes it an attractive choice for power plants because it has less sulfur and burns at around 8,400 to 8,800 BTUs per pound.

Lignite, often referred to as brown coal, is a soft, brown, combustible, sedimentary rock formed from naturally compressed peat.It has a carbon content around 25-35%, and is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content.When removed from the ground, it contains a very high amount of moisture which partially explains its low carbon content.

## How Is Coal Processed? |Ensuring the Coal Sample Representative
Coal is a black or brownish-black sedimentary rock that can be consumed and used to generate electricity. It is composed mostly of carbon and hydrocarbons, which contain energy that can be released through combustion. Coal is produced by tectonic motion. The dead biotic material will have changed after a few geological processes.

## Brown Coal - Climate Hero
Brown coal is a typ of coal that is also known as lignite.  These categories depend on the decomposition process of the coal, which basically means how long the coal has been underground. For example, about a 65-84 % content of carbon counts as lignite or peat. While between 84-91 % is categorised as hard coal.
