Aug 16, 2022Mortar is the element that bonds bricks or other masonry units together and provides structural capacity to the wall or other structure. There are four main types of mortar mix: N, O, S, and M. Each type is mixed with a different ratio of cement, lime, and sand to produce specific performance characteristics such as flexibility, bonding properties, and compressive strength.
