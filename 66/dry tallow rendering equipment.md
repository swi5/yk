5.05.2.5.2 Tallow. Tallow is a product from rendered animal by-products. The rendering process drives off water at high temperatures to separate the fat (or tallow) from the protein. About 30-35% of an animal's mass can be rendered, and of this, 24% is tallow.

Beef tallow has to be rendered before it can be used. To render beef tallow, you cut it into small pieces and stick in a shallow pan in the oven at 200. Leave for several hours as it "melts". You will have solid "cracklings" left in the bowl which can be eaten plain or on top of salads. The melted tallow can now be transferred to a glass.

##  AP42 Meat Rendering Plants Title: Comments and correspondence to 1995

## Rendering beef tallow in instant pot - Pitmaster Club
Top | #3. January 5, 2019, 03:03 PM. I've only rendered fat on the stove top. Put a little water (say, a cup) in a pot, add the fat and cook on low heat until the fat is rendered (the water will have evaporated, but it helps early on before some fat has rendered). The hotter the rendering, the more color your tallow will have.

## How to render tallow at home - Our Little Suburban Farmhouse
Set to a medium/low heat and if you are wet rendering then add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water. Stir occasionally to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom. Tallow is fully rendered when it is clear and you can see the crispy crackling bits. Line a loaf pan with parchment and line a fine mesh strainer with cheesecloth.
