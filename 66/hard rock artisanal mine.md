Bawdwin (Figs. 2.2 and 2.13) is a giant pyritic silver-rich base metal sulfide deposit at which commercial production and smelting began in 1909.This followed more than 500 years of artisanal mining for silver and the later completion of a mine railway. Bawdwin is the largest underground mine in Myanmar with combined ore production plus reserves estimated at over 20 million tons.

## Underground hard-rock mining
Underground hard-rock mining refers to various underground mining techniques used to excavate "hard" minerals, usually those containing metals, such as ore containing gold, silver, iron, copper, zinc, nickel, tin, and lead.It also involves the same techniques used to excavate ores of gems, such as diamonds and rubies. Soft-rock mining refers to the excavation of softer minerals, such as salt

Hard rock mines include most metal and diamond mines. They tend to be deep, and the orebody is often steeply inclined (or dipping). Shafts can be as a deep as several kilometres. Access from the surface is via a shaft or a decline. There is a variety of mining methods used, often in the same mine, depending on the geometry of the orebody and

## Artisanal mining: the dangers that come with the job
Personal injury. The most direct danger of artisanal mining is the risk of personal injury faced by miners themselves. As artisanal mining typically occurs outside of the law, these projects may not conform to regulatory standards with regards to the quality of tools and equipment, or safety practices.
