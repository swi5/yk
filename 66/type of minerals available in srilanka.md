Sri Lanka exposes substantial parts of the lower continental crust [2]. In Sri Lanka 90% of the area is covered by Precambrian (over 600 mil-lion-year-old) metamorphic rocks. The other 10% which is in the Northern part of Sri Lanka consists of Miocene age (0-25 million years) limestone. Few Jurassic age out crops are also available in this area.

Oxides: When an ore is found in which one or more elements are combined with oxygen, it is an oxide mineral. These may have chemical formulas of the type XO (MgO, ZnO, CuO, etc.), X 2 O (Cu 2 O), X 2 O 3 (Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3), XO 2 (MnO 2, SnO 2) and XY 2 O 4 (MgAl 2 O 4, FeCr 2 O 4).The oxide minerals are mostly of metallic elements. Example: hematite, magnetite, and cuprite.
