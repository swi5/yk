## Segregation of Concrete - Causes and Prevention - The Constructor
In a good concrete, all concrete aggregates are evenly coated with sand and cement paste and forms a homogeneous mass. During handling, transporting, and placing, due to jerks and vibrations the paste of cement and sand gets separated from the coarse aggregate. If concrete segregates during transit it should be remixed properly before depositing.

Concrete Ingredients Calculation. For Cement, Sand and Coarse Aggregate. This is a Volumetric Calculation. Assuming we need 2 m 3 of concrete for M20 Concrete Mix, (Mix Ratio, M20 = 1 : 1.5 : 3) Total Part of the Concrete = 1+1.5+3 = 5.5 Parts. Therefore, Cement Quantity = (Cement Part / Concrete Parts )  Concrete Volume

Aggregate is a general term that embraces a wide variety of grained particulate materials with various sizes, physical properties, and chemical compositions. Aggregates are inert materials which can increase the volume and alter the properties of concrete. In fact, aggregates occupy a large volume in a concrete mixture.

## Analysis of the Demand Status of Sand Aggregate | World Highways
What is sand aggregate? Sand aggregate is a general term for sand, gravel and other materials in construction projects. It is the main building material for concrete and stone masonry in hydraulic engineering, and it acts as skeleton or filling in concrete. It is widely used in civil engineering such as cement concrete, asphalt concrete, road foundation, railway track slag, and mortar.
