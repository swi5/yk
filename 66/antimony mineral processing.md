## Antimony | U.S. Geological Survey
Antimony is an important mineral commodity used widely in modern industrialized societies. The element imparts strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance to alloys that are used in many areas of industry, including in lead-acid storage batteries. Antimony's leading use is as a fire retardant in safety equipment and in household goods, such as mattresses.

## Antimony ore processing flow chart and plants
Nature of antimony ore decides the antimony ore processing flow chart and the beneficiation method. The general antimony upgrading covers hand selection, gravity separation, and floatation separation. Flow sheet of energy-saving and high upgrading efficiency has been required. Here is a combination of gravity separation-floatation separation-gravity separation for antimony ore to share with you.
