## Jaw Crusher VS Gyratory Crusher - JXSCMACHINE
The gyratory crusher is taller than the jaw crusher, thus needs a high workshop design. Besides, gyratory crusher is heavy than jaw crusher, it's not convenient to move. Capacity. Gyratory crusher can work continuously, has high productivity and crushing ratio ( up to 6-9.5), working performance is very stable, light vibration.

## Jaw Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Rose and English [9] determined the capacity of a jaw crusher by considering the time taken and the distance travelled by the particles between the two plates after being subjected to repeat crushing forces between the jaws. Therefore, dry particles wedged between level A and level B (Figure 4.4) would leave the crusher at the next reverse movement of the jaw.
