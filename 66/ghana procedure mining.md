## Mining Policy - Minerals Commission
The industry was very vibrant during the pre-independence period when mining policy was largely geared towards assisting and promoting the maximization of mineral production in the interests of the colonial powers. Therefore, for example, Ghana accounted for 36% of total world gold output (8,153,426 fine ounces) between 1493 and 1600 when there
