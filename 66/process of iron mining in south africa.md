## Iron metallurgy in Africa
The topic of early iron-metallurgy in Africa encompasses both studies of the technology and archaeology of indigenous iron-production.. Some recent studies date the inception of iron metallurgy in Africa between 3000 and 2500 BCE. Evidence exists for earlier iron metallurgy in parts of Nigeria, Cameroon, and Central Africa, possibly from as early as around 2,000 BCE.
