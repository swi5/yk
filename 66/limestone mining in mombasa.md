## Environmental Hazards of Limestone Mining and Adaptive Practices for 
Limestone mining is likely to result in relatively local impacts such as reduced water quality, rerouting of recharge water in aquifer, increased run-off and thereby leading to localized reduction in groundwater storage (Hobbs and Gunn 1998). The major impact of quarrying on water relates to mine dewatering and the associated decline of the

## Global Outlook: Limestone Around the World - MDLPA
Mining limestone begins with its extraction from viable deposits in mines and quarries, like the one present in the Lake Belt Region of western Miami-Dade County. There is no naturally formed rock anywhere in the world that demonstrates the versatility of limestone. Crushing or screening the rock only bolsters the multiplicity of applications.
