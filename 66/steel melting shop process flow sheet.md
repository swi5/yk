To produce steel first the iron ore is heated and melted in a furnace. The impurities are then removed from the molten iron. Carbon and other required alloying elements are added to make steel. Modern-day steel making is highly improved and specialized. There are two processes that are widely popular for modern-day steel making.

## Steelmaking
Steelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and/or scrap.In steelmaking, impurities such as nitrogen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur and excess carbon (the most important impurity) are removed from the sourced iron, and alloying elements such as manganese, nickel, chromium, carbon and vanadium are added to produce different grades of steel.

## Infrastructure - Visakhapatnam Steel Plant
Steel is made in steel melting shop in the refractory lined vessels called LD Converters by blowing oxygen through the hot metal bath. While iron making is a reduction process, steel making is an oxidation process. The oxygen reacts with impurities like carbon, silicon, phosphorous, sulphur etc. present in hot metal to produce steel.
