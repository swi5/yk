During the surface magnetization roasting process, the outer layer of hematite was first reduced to magnetite. The reduction of hematite to magnetite resulted in a lattice volume expansion of about 10% . Coupled with the effect of temperature stress, a porous magnetite layer was formed on the surface of the hematite particles [36,37].

## Beneficiation method for mixed magnetite and hematite
The invention provides a beneficiation method for mixed magnetite and hematite. The method comprises the steps of a, performing first section ore grinding and second section ore grinding on the mixed magnetite and hematite to obtain ore pulp; b, grading the ore pulp, and performing first fluctuation and desliming on the obtained overflowing ore pulp to obtain slurry and setting sand; c
