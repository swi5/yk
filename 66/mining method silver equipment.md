## Mining Methods - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
MINING METHODS. The method of extracting the ore is dependent upon the nature of the ore occurrence. Each orebody is a problem in itself. All influencing factors, as size, shape, position, nature and grade of an orebody, and character of the enclosing walls, are fully considered before the method of extraction is decided.

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

## methods of mining platinum
Jan 15, 2014Â· The mining of platinum ores is similar to gold mining inasmuch as the orebody is a thin, tabular reef covering an extensive area. This enables a progressive method of mining - the reef is drilled and blasted to advance the face, support being installed for local control of the hanging wall.

## Common Types of Industrial Mining Equipment & Machinery
Longwall mining usually takes place deep underground, when excavating coal. The process relies on incredibly sophisticated interconnected pieces of equipment that work together in an efficient and safe mining operation. Source: Midwest. A longwall mining site is usually 3 to 4 kilometers long and 250 to 400 meters wide.

## Selection of mining method - QueensMineDesignWiki
The process must recognize that more than one mining method can be used in the mine. Cut-off-grade selection Selection of mining methods, sizing of stopes. The first selection will be based mostly on the shape and the geotechnical characteristics of the orebody. Review of the main points in reference to the previously discussed mining methods

## Strip Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Andrew P. Schissler, in Encyclopedia of Energy, 2004 2.3 Strip Mining. Strip mining is employed in coal reserves where the overburden is removed in rectangular blocks in plan view called pits or strips. The pits are parallel and adjacent to each other. Strip mining is fundamentally different from contour or area mining on how the overburden is displaced, called spoil handling.
