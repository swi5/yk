The reduction ratio is then calculated by comparing the input feed size passing 80 percent versus the discharge size that passes 80 percent. The finer the closed-side setting, the greater the proportion of fines produced. The closed-side setting of a jaw crusher helps determine the nip angle within a chamber, typically 19 to 23 degrees.

## aggregate reduction ratio crushers
May 13, 2019· Setting jaw crushers. Ideally, the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6-to-1. There are different ways to calculate reduction ratio, but the best way is something called the P80 factor. The reduction ratio is then calculated by comparing the input feed size passing 80 percent versus the discharge size that passes 80 percent.
