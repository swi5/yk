Figure 1: Gold Cost Standard Evolution. (Christie, 2013) In 1996, in an attempt to standardize the cost reporting of gold, the Gold Institute published a guideline. It was basically the division of the costs of mining into cash and total costs. The cash costs are the regular direct costs involved in the mining and processing of the ore.
