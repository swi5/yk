## Construction sand shortage leads to development of manufactured sand 
To address the issue of sand scarcity, Holcim is exploring the potential of manufactured sand - or 'M-sand' - for use in concrete. M-sand is a term used to describe fine aggregates produced by crushing stone using specialised equipment, or generated as a byproduct of the production of coarse aggregates.

The production of sand for construction purposes grew significantly with the push for paved roads during World War I and through the 1920s. The housing boom of the late 1940s and early 1950s, coupled with the increased use of concrete for building construction, provided another boost in production.

## The Applications of Manufactured Sand in Concrete Production
Manufactured sand can be used as one important component in concrete, mortar, and concrete and mortar products production. At present, China's largest Three Gorges Project (TGP), the Yellow River Xiaolangdi Project had used manufactured sand to produce concrete. Additionally, according to existing engineering projects, C10-C70 strength ordinary

## There are many obvious features compared to other forming techniques: 1.
Here's a look at the pros and cons of each. Advantages: Speed of production with injection moulding is increased by fact that no curing time is required. Speed results in lower mold costs, fewer cavities being necessary for specific output. Other features which helped make injection molding are, 1) Dimensional accuracy good.
