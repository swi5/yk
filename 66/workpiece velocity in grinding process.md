Grinding takes an abrasive — often attached to a wheel — and uses its many grains to cut a workpiece. Variations on this process are useful for a wide variety of applications. On its surface, grinding seems simple: a machine takes a rotating tool (usually a wheel) with abrasive grains and applies it to a workpiece's surface to remove

Turning Operation. Turning is a type of machining operation used to remove material from the outer diameter of a cylindrical workpiece. The workpiece is held in a chuck rotating at high speed during turning operation. A single-point cutting tool is fixed to the machine, and it moves in X and Y directions to cut the material.
