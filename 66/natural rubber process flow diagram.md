## The Manufacturing Process of Rubber - Seacon Corporation
The production process of natural rubber begins with the cultivation of rubber trees (Havea brasiliensis). Rubber trees must be allowed to grow for about seven years before they become viable for harvesting rubber. Once the trees have reached the appropriate level of maturity, they will be tapped.

The screw will begin to carry the rubber forward into the die, with an increase in pressure and temperature occurring as the material gets

Transfer molding is a natural progression in development to limit the disadvantages of compression molding. The process starts out with a blank being loaded in the chamber, which is then distributed into several cavities. In this beginning stage, pre-heating takes place in the rubber, forcing the rubber to flow through channels.

From the first commercial rubber plantation in Sri Lankan, the nation has had a proud history of manufacturing high quality natural rubber latex. Rubber was first introduced in the late 19th century under the British. Though slow to catch on, the cultivation of rubber accelerated in the early 1900's due to a slump in world tea prices.

Rubber trees can be tapped for about 35 years. The collected latex is first coagulated into soft, spongy blocks by adding formic acid or acetic acid. This makes it solid and produces sheets which are cut into standard size. There are several other ways of processing the rubber. The latest processing method is to produce Hevea crumb.

## rubber process flow diagram
The 4 Most Common Rubber Manufacturing Processes. The process starts out with a blank being loaded in the chamber, which is then distributed into several caviti In this beginning stage, pre-heating takes place in the rubber, forcing the rubber to flow through channels This pre-heating reduces the curing time and allows the rubber to flow easier and fill mold cavities efficiently
