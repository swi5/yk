The third way to monitor conveyor speed is to attach an encoder to an encoder measuring wheel that rides on the surface of the belt or one of the rollers if the belt itself is crowded with product. Typically, these wheels are 1 foot in circumference, which makes an easy conversion from RPM to linear speed in feet per minute.

The first step in the design of a belt conveyor with a specified conveyor capacity is to determine the speed and width of the belt. The magnitude of the belt speed can be determined using: equation. Where: C = Conveyor capacity. r = Material density (kg/m3) V = Belt speed (m/s) A = Conveyor's belt cross-sectional area.

The speed at which the conveyor belt moves depends on the size of the rollers and their revolutions per minute. Measure the diameter of the rollers around which the conveyor belt is wrapped. Multiply the diameter of the roller by pi, 3.14159. This calculation yields the circumference of the rollers.

## How A Conveyor Belt Works - Realonomics
The ends of a belt are free and a buckle forms the belt into a loop by securing one end to another part of the belt at or near the other end. How does a conveyor pulley work? A conveyor pulley is a mechanical device used to change the direction of the belt in a conveyor system to drive the belt and to tension the belt. Modern pulleys are made

TC = F 1 x L x CW: F 1 = .035″ [Normal friction factor for average conditions (over 20°F) to move empty belt.] L = Belt length (ft.)CW = Weight of conveyor belt components. (Table A of the Engineering Manual) TL = F 2 x L x MW F 2 = .04″ [Normal friction factor to move load horizontally.] L = Belt length (ft.)MW = Material weight (lbs. per lineal foot).
