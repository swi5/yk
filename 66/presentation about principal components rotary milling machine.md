## The working principle of milling machine - studentlesson
Working principle. The workpiece is held on a worktable of the machine. The table movement controls the feed of the workpiece against the rotating cutter. This cutter is fixed on a spindle or arbor which revolves at desired speed. the workpiece moves against the cutter and remove the metal from the surface in order to produce the desired shape.

Milling is the machining process in which the removal of metal takes place due to the cutting action of a rotating milling cutter.In a milling machine, the cutter is rotating due to workpiece is fed against it.This machine can hold more than one tool at a time. The cutter rotates at high speed, and because of the many cutting edges, it removes metal at a very fast rate.

The type of milling machine most commonly found in student shops is a vertical spindle machine with a swiveling head. Although there are several other types of milling machines, this document will focus only on the vertical milling machine. A milling machine removes metal by rotating a multi-toothed cutter that is fed into the moving workpiece.
