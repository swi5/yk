The lead ore was always associated with other waste minerals known as 'gangue', usually calcite (CaCO3) or barytes (BaSO4). The density of lead ore is 7.4-7.6 g/cm3,the density of calcite is 2.6-2.8 g/cm3.There is a distinct difference in density between lead ore and gangue, so we can separate the lead ore from gangue by gravity separation

## Lead
Lead is a chemical element with the symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and atomic number 82. It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials. Lead is soft and malleable, and also has a relatively low melting point.When freshly cut, lead is silvery with a hint of blue; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
The best practices for chemical leaching are a combination of pre-concentration and mill leaching, as they lead to the least amount of waste, a short processing time for miners, and high gold recoveries. First, concentration is done through gravity techniques. Then the concentrate is simultaneously milled and leached.
