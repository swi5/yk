There is a 1:2:3 ratio of bags of cement and sand and gravel in 1 cubic meter. As a general rule of thumb, you can approximate this by percentage: If the total number of units of cement and aggregates in 4.5 cubic meters of concrete at a 1:2:3 ratio is 6. One-sixth of an inch equals 0.75 centimeters of cement.

## Suitability Of River Sand Mining Sand And Sea Sand As Fine Aggregate In 
Atural sand is being used as fine aggregate in concrete making and is preferred as fine aggregate. it is mostly mined from the river beds and indiscriminate mining of sand has reportedly causing damages to the environment. we also see that dependency on this source has led to high material costs also. now there isgh scarcity of natural sand.

## Can Sea Sand be Used for Concrete Construction?
Concrete is a mixture of cement, coarse aggregates, fine aggregates or sand and water. Among them, natural river sand is the main source of fine aggregate or sand. However, with the exhaustion of river sand resources and restricted mining, the contradiction between the supply and demand of construction sand has become more and more intense.

Fine aggregate is basically any normal sand particle that comes from the land through the mining process. Fine aggregates comprise regular sand or any squashed stone particles that are 1/4â³ or smaller. This item is frequently alluded to as 1/4â³ short as it alludes to the size, or evaluation, of this specific aggregate. Fine Aggregate.
