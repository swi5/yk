## What Is Impact Crusher and Its Working Principle?
Working Principle It is crushing machine which crushes materials relying on the impacting force. When the materials enter the field of the hammer, it is impacted by the hammers, thrown onto the impact plate, and crushed. The stuff springs from the impact plate, is impacted by the hammers again, and thrown onto impact plate.
