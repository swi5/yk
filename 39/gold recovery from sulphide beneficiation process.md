## Gold extraction
Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e. gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as color) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calverite (AuTe), aurostibnite (AuSb

## gold recovery from sulphide beneficiation process
Recovery of Gold in Pyritic Sulfide Ores - Mine . Recovery of gold in sulfide ores has fallen into several categories. First is froth flotation, and second is cyanidation of the ores. Using cyanide to recover gold from sulfide ores generally results in 30 to 35% recovery, and the best I have heard of is around 50% recovery.
