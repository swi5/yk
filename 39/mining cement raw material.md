## What are the raw materials of cement?
The ingredients for cement are limestone, clay, sand, and water. The first step is to mix these ingredients together in a large container. The second step is to heat the mixture in a kiln at a high temperature. The third step is to grind the mixture into a powder. The fourth step is to mix the powder with water to form a paste.
