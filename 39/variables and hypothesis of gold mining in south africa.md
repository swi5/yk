## The devastating impact of Gold Mining in South Africa
For 130 years South Africa has been exploiting its gold resources in Johannesburg. But at what cost? 278 abandoned mines and 200 mining dumps, that contain about 6 billion tons of waste, exist in Johannesburg. For every single gram of gold extracted, 200 kg of waste are produced. Inside the city, hills composed of sand debris arise.

Gold mining in West Africa may be examined by considering two paradoxes. Regions with gold mines may have given rise to stronger and more complex state structures, while gold mining also gave rise to incentives for rent-seeking, conflict, and undermin­ ing of state structures.
