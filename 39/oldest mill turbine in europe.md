## History of wind power
Sailboats and sailing ships have been using wind power for at least 5,500 years, [citation needed] and architects have used wind-driven natural ventilation in buildings since similarly ancient times. The use of wind to provide mechanical power came somewhat later in antiquity. The Babylonian emperor Hammurabi planned to use wind power for his ambitious irrigation project in the 17th century BC.
