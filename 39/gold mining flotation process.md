May 23, 2022The mixed flotation process is a commonly used process in the flotation of polymetallic sulfide ores. First, all the useful minerals are mixed and floated, and then the useful minerals in the mixed concentrate are separated one by one. This process is suitable for useful minerals grade comparison.

## Recovering Gold through the Froth Flotation Process
Pre-19th century placer mining operations used mercury to dissolve the gold in crushed ore, making it easier to recover. Later innovations include the MacArthur-Forrest Process and borax flux extraction. However, one of the most interesting methods is froth flotation. Froth flotation works by exploiting the hydrophobic properties of gold molecules.

## Gold flotation process - Jinpeng Mining
Flotation is a method that is widely used in gold ore processing plant to process the rock gold,commonly used in dealing with highly floatable sulfide minerals containing gold ore. Flotation process can maximum enrich gold to the sulfide mineral, tailings can be abandoned directly, the cost of processing plant is low, 80% of China's rock gold are used in this method.

## Gold CIL process - Yantai Jinpeng Mining equipment, ore dressing 
Cyanidation ---carbon adsorption process is the most widely used in gold cyanide extraction process . The principle in brief is the carbon could adsorb liquid gold from cyanide solution . In 1970s, with the research and establishment of adsorption of carbon loaded with gold and the recovery of carbon discharge gold, make recycle the carbon and reduce the cost, and easy to process the gold

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below).
