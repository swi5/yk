With the in-feed method, the regulating wheel spins the part at one speed while pushing it towards the grinding wheel, which is spinning at a faster speed. The greater the difference in speeds, the faster the removal rate. 4. The choice of grinding wheel is critical. Another key factor in centerless grinding is the choice of grinding wheel.

This process is known as Dressing of grinding wheel and the whole process takes 15 to 20 minutes to operate. The life of the grinding wheel is described as the time period between two successive dressings. Grinding operation is one of the machining processes which consume the highest specific cutting energy with very less material removal rate.

Grinding. Grinding is a finishing process used to improve surface finish, abrade hard materials, and tighten the tolerance on flat and cylindrical surfaces by removing a small amount of material. Information in this section is organized according to the subcategory links in the menu bar to the left. In grinding, an abrasive material rubs against the metal part and removes tiny pieces of material.

STEP 1. The plastic material to be ground enters a granulator via a specific loading system. When it reaches the cutting chamber, it is shredded by a rotating body (rotor), to which blades are applied. Fixed blades (or counter blades), positioned in the cutting chamber in a diametrically opposite position, are used for cutting.
