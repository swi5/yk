## Cement Replacement Material - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Concrete is an artificial stone manufactured by mixing together coarse and fine aggregates, cement, water and often other components such as cement replacement materials, e.g., pulverised fuel ash, and chemical admixtures, e.g., superplasticisers. The grading of an aggregate defines the proportions of particles of different size in the aggregate.

Section snippets Concrete mix design. The 10 concrete mixes used are depicted in Fig. 1: three reference concrete (RC) mixes with 100% basalt (BRC), granite (GRC) or limestone (LRC) coarse aggregates; six concrete mixes obtained by replacing each of the primary aggregates (PA) used in the reference concretes with marble coarse aggregates (CMA) at ratios of 20% or 50% of the total volume; and

## Replacement Of Coarse Aggregate In Concrete - Civil Planets
Using the E-waste as a partial replacement of coarse aggregate in concrete is the best solution. We can not fully replace material in concrete because it impacts the workability of concrete. The electronic waste is crushed as required particle size and can be mixed with other aggregates in concrete which will not affect the quality & durability

##  An Experimental Study on Mechanical Propeerties of Concrete Partially 
properties of concrete which is partially replaced by recycled aggregates and marble powder as coarse aggregate and fine aggregate respectively. In this study compressive strength, flexural strength and tensile strengths are evaluated. The percentage of Recycled aggregate as a partial replacement of coarse aggregate are 45%,50% and
