## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, & Extraction Methods
Sep 27, 2021The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

The cast iron is usually extracted from its oxide ore (haematite). This process involves the following steps: 1) Concentration. The ore is crushed in jaw crushers and is broken to small pieces of about 1 inch in size. The crushed ore is concentrated by gravity separation process in which it is washed with water to remove clay, sand, etc.

The ore is generally associated with rock impurities like clay, sand etc. called ' gangue or matrix'. The purification of ore means removal of gangue from the powdered ore. This process is otherwise called concentration of the ore or ore dressing. Thus, the percentage of the ore in the concentrated ore is higher than that in the original ore.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material. Grade of iron ore is usually determined by the total Fe content in the ore.

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO
