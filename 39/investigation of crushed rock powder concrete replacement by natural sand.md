## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
The percentage passing 150 microns of manufactured sand is relaxed to 20% (while that of natural sand is limited to 10%). As per design and economics, crushed sand can be used to partially or fully replace river sand from a concrete mix. The Availability of crushed sand is not a concern as it can be manufactured from rocks in any season.

Because gravel comes in a number of different shapes, sizes, and colors, it may be used in landscaping as a decoration or an accent while also providing potential benefits such as drainage.  Crushed stone is a type of medium-sized gravel that is formed by mechanically crushing stone. Most commonly, limestone, dolomite, or granite is crushed.

## Replacing natural sand by crushed rock in concrete using nonlinear 
There is a lot of pressure to stop using natural sand and instead use crushed rock or recycled aggregate in concretes. However, crushed rock tends to have sharp corners, which affect not only the rheology of fresh concrete, but they also affect the strength of hardened concrete. So it is not possible to add large amounts of crushed rock easily.

## Landscaping sand that hardenslegang
Why Bagged Concrete Hardens . Concrete is a building material made by mixing cement, sand, small stones, and water. A bag of ready-to-use concrete, such as Quikrete, is a mix of cement, generally Portland cement, sand, and gravel or stone. Cement is a binding agent. When mixed with water, it creates a paste effectively binding together the sand.

## Study on Properties of Concrete With Manufactured Sand As Replacement 
In the present investigation workability, strength and durability of concrete with manufactured sand as replacement to natural sand in proportions of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 100% is studied. The experiments were conducted on M 20 and M 30 concrete
