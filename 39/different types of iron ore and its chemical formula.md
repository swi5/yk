Limonite is a hydrous iron oxide ore, which is formed after the weathering of other ores, and is the most widely distributed in nature, but it is rare to find a large amount of ore deposits. Its chemical formula is nFe2O3·mH2O (n=1～3, m=1～4). Limonite is actually a mixture of goethite (Fe2O3·H2O), hydrogoethite (2Fe2O3·H2O) and iron

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

Broadly, it can be classified as ferrous (by-products of processing iron and steel), ferroalloy (by-product of ferroalloy production) or non-ferrous/base metals (by-products of recovering non-ferrous materials like copper, nickel, zinc and phosphorus). Within these general categories, slags can be further categorized by
