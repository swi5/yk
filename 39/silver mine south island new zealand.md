## What's the Difference Between North and South Island? - Silver Fern 
South Island is the rugged sister of the North Island. Fjords, lakes and mountains set the scene and the Southern Alps (the highest mountain range in Australasia) are home to Mt Cook. This iconic mountain is snow-capped all year round.
