## What Is a Vertical Mill? - Career Trend
A vertical milling machine shapes metal into a predetermined form, from ball bearings, to airplane parts or flywheels. A vertical mill is used typically in a machine shop; however, some people work from their own garage. A vertical mill usually works with a very tight tolerance, meaning there is a very little margin of error.

## How Do Wind Turbines Work? | Department of Energy
A wind turbine turns wind energy into electricity using the aerodynamic force from the rotor blades, which work like an airplane wing or helicopter rotor blade. When wind flows across the blade, the air pressure on one side of the blade decreases. The difference in air pressure across the two sides of the blade creates both lift and drag.

## Vertical Roller Mills - FLSmidth
As vertical roller mills are 30 to 50 percent more efficient than other grinding solutions, they give cement plant owners a great opportunity to maximise productivity and minimise operating costs. The high energy efficiency is especially beneficial in regions with limited power generating capacity or where electricity availability is limited.
