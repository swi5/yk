## sand mining - Barbudaful
Sand mining was the largest industry to ever take place on the island, and after thirty years of stopping and starting the Barbuda Council tried to finally bring an end to the industry by Council resolution in early April 2012. In spite of this, it has been continued by various Council leaders on both sides, who view it as a lucrative income regardless of the environmental damage caused.

There is growing interest in opening up the deep-sea to industrial mining for copper, nickel, cobalt, gold, rare earths and other metals. But at what cost? The International Seabed Authority (ISA) met recently to discuss a strategic plan for the development and regulation of mining in the deep ocean beyond national waters.
