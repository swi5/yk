## Modelling regional ecological security pattern and restoration 
In the context of open-pit coal mining, drawing on water-related research is key to understand water runoff and quality (Shao et al., 2015).  Least-cost ecological corridors were first identified and within those corridors using Linkage Mapper to model movement along with a resistance surface.

When the open pit at Sacramento Hill, Bisbee, Ariz., became so deep that hauling ore from the pit was too expensive, the deep ore was mined by glory-holing. In 1929, 574,000 tons and in 1930, 304,000 tons were mined by this method. The bottom of the old pit was oval, about 450 feet long and 400 feet wide.

## What consequence does open-pit mining most likely have on plant life?
Open-pit mining includes blasting of soil and vegetation to access underground ore layers or coal seams [17]. Consequently this method produces large volumes of mining waste including soil and overburden which increase the vulnerability of mining environments to soil erosion and pollution.

## Coal mining
Coal that occurs at depths of 55 to 90 m (180 to 300 ft) are usually deep mined, but in some cases surface mining techniques can be used. For example, some western U.S. coal that occur at depths in excess of 60 m (200 ft) are mined by the open pit methods, due to thickness of the seam 20-25 metres (60-90 feet).

## Safety system for open pit mining
Jul 2, 2010. A locally designed and manufactured safety system, adapted for open pit mining applications and which could save the mining industry tens of millions of rand, is about to be launched on the South African market. Plans are already underway to introduce this system, known simply as intelligent safety system, or collision avoidance
