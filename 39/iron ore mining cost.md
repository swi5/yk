This guide of mining shows how each floor is. This wiki is a read-only version of the Stardew Valley Wiki.  Note that obtaining Iron Ore from a Geode is only possible after reaching level 26 of The Mines. Before reaching level 26, a geode that would give iron ore will instead give copper ore.

## China continues to ravage iron ore prices, miners - Australian Mining
Venture Minerals has suspended operations at its Riley iron ore mine in Tasmania due to unfeasible iron ore prices, as its milestone first shipment makes its way to China.  Iron ore prices have dropped to a 10-month low as China made further calls to slow steel production, causing major and minor iron ore miners to feel the effects in

## Iron mining in the United States
Because iron and steel-making at the time consumed more coal than iron ore, the steel mills moved closer to the coal mines to minimize transportation costs. Although later overshadowed by production from the Lake Superior mines, iron ore mining in New Jersey and New York continued until the 1960s. Iron mining in Pennsylvania ended in 1973.

## China iron ore cost summary Report | Wood Mackenzie
Jul 19, 2022Our 2021 average total cash cost of Chinese iron ore mines is US$15/tonne higher compared to 2020 due to higher energy costs, strong RMB and higher royalties and levies because of higher iron ore prices in 2021. We expect costs to increase to around US$82/tonne due to higher diesel prices in 2022.

Nov 9, 2021The mine will be 40 miles from the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribes (FMPST) reservation and is the largest lithium resource in the US. Lithium Americas, the company in charge of the project, is leaching lithium from the clay deposits with sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid attacks the ore, separating the lithium which dissolves into the acid.

In contrast, Chinese iron ore production tends to be at the higher end, which is likely to reflect higher processing costs due to the lower quality of iron ore mined as well as the high cost of transporting domestic ore to steel
