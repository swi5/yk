## Coal preparation plant - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
A coal preparation plant (or coal handling plant) is a place where coal is prepared for use after it has been mined. The coal is washed and resized here, before it is transported to be sold, loaded on coal transport or used locally. It is then transported to coal-fired power plants, for example.

The scale of the coal preparation and CWF plant design chosen for the study is 200 tons per hour coal output on a dry basis (285 tph CWF).  For the coal burning utilities, they lower fuel expenditures and help to establish a stable fuel supply thereby reducing the level of inventories which must be held.
