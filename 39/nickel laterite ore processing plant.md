01 Rotary kiln drying and prereduction-electric furnace reduction smelting method. Rotary kiln drying and pre-reduction-electric furnace reduction smelting is a classic process for processing laterite nickel ore. In the rotary kiln (800 ℃), the laterite nickel ore with about 30% water content will be dehydrated and pre-reduced.

Nickel occurs in essentially two ore types; magmatic sulphides and ('wet' or 'dry') laterites. The sulphides typically are found hundreds of metres below ground with principle mineralisation including pentlandite (Ni, Fe)9S8 . Major deposits such as those in Canada and Russia have historically provided the bulk of nickel production.

## Minerals | Free Full-Text | Nickel Laterites—Mineralogical  - MDPI
Nickel laterite ore is used to produce nickel metal, predominantly to manufacture stainless steel as well as nickel sulfate, a key ingredient in the batteries that drive electric vehicles. Nickel laterite production is on the rise and surpassing conventional sulfide deposits. The efficiency of mining and processing nickel laterites is defined by their mineralogical composition. Typical

## Nickel Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
Many of the sulfide deposits occur at great depth. Laterites are formed by the weathering of ultramafic rocks and are a near-surface phenomenon. Most of the nickel on Earth is believed to be concentrated in the planet's core. Nickel is primarily sold for first use as refined metal (cathode, powder, briquet, etc.) or ferronickel.
