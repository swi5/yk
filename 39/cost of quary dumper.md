## Whatcha pay for a truckload o' gravel? | Homesteading Forum
204 Posts. #10 · Aug 20, 2004. About $200/ truckload- 22 tons or so, I'm about 12 miles from the quarry. I thought about buying a smallish dump truck ($3000, gas job, automatic-could haul about 6T), but by the time I figured in fuel, licensing, insurance, taxes and time, I decided it was about the same to just pay to have it delivered.
