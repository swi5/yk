## Minecraft Caves And Cliffs: New Best Level For Strip Mining - ScreenRant
Minecraft's Caves & Cliffs update has expanded the world's maximum depth from Y-level 0 to Y-level -60 which means there are sixty additional layers added to the bottom of each world. While Y-level 12 was the optimal level for strip mining, that level has now been lowered to Y-level -35. What this means is that diamonds will appear on or around this level more frequently than any other.

Yea, I finally found that the best way to get iron early game is to dig down to level 14 (avoiding caves ofc) and stripmining a bit. Then once geared up, you can find plenty of iron in caves. I tried 6 seeds but didn't find a single high mountain near me in anyone. So I had to switch to this method to get iron. 2 Continue this thread level 1

Iron deposits primarily appear between levels 40 and 80. Beyond 80 and you start focusing on gold deposits. So if you're trying to farm iron, focus on 40-80.
