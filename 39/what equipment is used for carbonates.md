## Carbonates (CO3) and bicarbonates (HCO3) in water - BIOLOGY TEACH
Carbonates. When the pH value of a sample of natural water is above 8.4, the CO3 is present, normally as sodium carbonate. The carbonate ion is converted to HCO3. The amount of acid used a measure of the carbonate present. CO 3 + H = HCO 3 Bicarbonate. Bicarbonate ions react with mineral acid and release carbon dioxide (CO2) into the solution.

Carbonate has a -2 charge while bicarbonate has a -1 charge due to the extra hydrogen proton it contains. When we deal with brewing water chemistry, we are actually working with 'equivalents' which is equal to the weight of the molecule divided by its electrical charge. The molecular weight of carbonate is 60 grams and bicarbonate is 61 grams.

## Thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate - RSC Education
In association with Nuffield Foundation. Calcium carbonate is strongly heated until it undergoes thermal decomposition to form calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. The calcium oxide (unslaked lime) is dissolved in water to form calcium hydroxide (limewater). Bubbling carbon dioxide through this forms a milky suspension of calcium carbonate.
