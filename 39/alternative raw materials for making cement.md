## Eco-Friendly Alternatives To Traditional Concrete
Posted on July 18, 2019. Concrete is a mixture of cement, gravel, sand, water and a range of aggregates. With about 10 billion tons of concrete produced every year, it is the most consumed substance in the world, second only to water.. It is also the world's most widely used material for construction - from bridges to large buildings, concrete forms the very foundation of our infrastructure.

##  Guidelines for Co-Processing Fuels and Raw Materials in Cement 
Producing cement consumes both large quantities of raw materials and fuel, and produces substantial CO2 emissions. The use of alternative fuels and raw materials in cement manufacturing can reduce the amount of conventional fuels and virgin raw materials needed, and thus reduce the overall environmental impact of the operations.

## How Cement Is Made
Concrete is formed when portland cement creates a paste with water that binds with sand and rock to harden.

Step 6 - Pour Cement. Simply pour the concrete into the form slowly and steadily. For a project such as this, it is best to steer clear of quick-drying cement formulas. A quick-drying formula can end up causing more work for you later since you need to take time to pour and even out the cement. Make sure you watch to see the falling concrete.

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.
