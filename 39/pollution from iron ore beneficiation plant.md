## pollution from iron ore beneficiation process
Oct 09, 2014· The beneficiation of iron ore typically occurs in a liquid medium. In addition, many pollution abatement devices use water to control dust emissions. At a given facility, these techniques may require between 600 and 7,000 gallons of water per ton of iron concentrate produced, depending on the specific beneficiation methods used.

Introduction Iron ore. Iron ore is rock containing enough iron content, and in sufficient volume and accessibility to mining and transportation to be able to be economically mined. Iron in ore iron is most commonly found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite (FeO(OH)), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O)) or siderite (FeCO 3). Hematite and magnetite are the most common

## Lithium
Lithium (from Greek: λίθος, romanized: lithos, lit. 'stone') is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal.Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element.Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as

## Treatment and Recycling of the Process Water in Iron Ore  - Hindawi

The process water carried plenty of residual processing reagents, and such wastewater with color depth and strong smell could seriously affect the environment and the local people.
