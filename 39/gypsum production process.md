Very commonly it is formed from the hydration of anhydrite by surface waters and groundwaters, and, thus, many gypsiferous strata grade downward into anhydrite rocks. This replacement causes a 30 percent to 50 percent volume increase and results in intense, tight folding of the remaining anhydrite layers. Gypsum also occurs disseminated in

## FGD Gypsum Production Process - Gypsum Association
FGD Gypsum Production Process Mineralogically identical to natural gypsum, FGD gypsum, or synthetic gypsum, is produced from gas captured within emission control systems at coal fired electric utilities. An emission that would compromise air quality, sulfur dioxide (SO 2) gas, is the primary contribution coal makes to FGD gypsum.

##  How Gypsum is Made - AWCI
This method of gypsum mining produces approximately 90,000 to 160,000 tons of ore a year. The largest gypsum quarry in the world, Gold Bond's Milford, Nova Scotia operation, produces four and a half to five million tons of ore per year. The quarry process begins by first removing the earth over the deposit.

## Gypsum Powder Production Process - Buy Product on Shijiazhuang Wuxing 
Technological process of gypsum powder production line. 1. Crushing system. Gypsum raw material enters the crusher through the feeder, and the crusher breaks the large-size gypsum ore into small particles less than 30mm for standby. According to the size of gypsum raw materials and different production needs, you can choose the crusher of the
