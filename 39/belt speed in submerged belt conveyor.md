## Materials conveyors: A guide for specifying belt conveyor systems
Jan 26, 2021The first step in the design of a belt conveyor with a specified conveyor capacity is to determine the speed and width of the belt. The magnitude of the belt speed can be determined using: equation. Where: C = Conveyor capacity. r = Material density (kg/m3) V = Belt speed (m/s) A = Conveyor's belt cross-sectional area.

The lowest overall belt conveyor cost occur in the range of belt widths of 0.6 to 1.0 m [2]. The required conveying capacity can be reached by selection of a belt width in this range and selecting whatever belt speed is required to achieve the required flow rate.

## Belt Weigher | Conveyor Belt Scale - Weighing Conveyor System
A typical conveyor belt scale or belt weigher system has a weigh bridge structure supported on load cells, an electronic integrator, and a belt speed sensor. The load cells measure the material weight on the belt, and send a signal to the integrator. The integrator also receives input in the form of electrical pulses from a belt speed sensor.

Most underground conveyor belts are narrow and run at high speed for maximum capacity. However, for operations that can use greater widths Depreux conveyor belts are available in widths up to 84". Tensile strength, impact absorption and wear characteristics are addressed in three separate constructions: multi-ply, straight-wrap and steel-cord.

The skew angle, Î³, should be 3Â° to 12Â° depending upon belt load, the friction between roller and belt, and on the belt speed. This method is not recommended to be used with thin belts of low transverse rigidity. Since the belt does not only run on the rollers but also slides, friction exists and thus increases belt wear.
