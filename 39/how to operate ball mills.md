## Ball Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Tumbling ball mills or ball mills are most widely used in both wet and dry systems, in batch and continuous operations, and on small and large scales. Grinding elements in ball mills travel at different velocities. Therefore, collision force, direction, and kinetic energy between two or more elements vary greatly within the ball charge.
