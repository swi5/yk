## The Different Types of Rock Crushers - Interesting Facts
While a jaw crusher "chews" and a cone crusher squeezes, an impact rotates the material at intense speeds to break it down in its final stage. Keep in mind, this guide to the types of crushers is a simplistic view of the milling process; there are more nuances to creating aggregate, like the importance of wear liners to break down rock.
