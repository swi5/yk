## How much does a ton of decomposed granite cost?
The cost of the materials alone is between $35 and $60 per inch of coverage, assuming you use basic crushed granite. Stabilized decomposed granite costs about $185 per ton. The price for this type of granite is much higher than that of simple crushed granite because the supplier must add and mix a stabilizing agent with the granite.
