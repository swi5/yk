## Structure and properties of aerated concrete: A review. (2000)
Abstract: In this paper, we report the results of our investigation on the possibility of producing foam concrete by using a geopolymer system. Class C fly ash was mixed with an alkaline activator solution (a mixture of sodium silicate and NaOH), and foam was added to the geopolymeric mixture to produce lightweight concrete.

Foamed concrete, also called cellular light weight concrete is produced by the mixing of Portland cement, sand including or alone fly ash, water and preformed stable foam. The foam is produced with the help of a foam generator by using foaming agent. The air content is typically between 40 to 80 percent of the total volume.

## Feasibility study of palm oil boiler ash (POBA) as a partial 
A study was conducted to explore the effect of palm oil boiler ash (POBA) on foamed concrete by varying the percentage of POBA over sand quantities (0, 4, 8 and 12%). This paper primarily discusses the water absorption test, uniaxial compressive
