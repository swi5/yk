## Complete information on various Types of Iron Ores found in India
In India we get four types of iron ores, viz. (a) hematite (Fe 2 0 3 ), magnetite (limonite (2Fe 2 0 3 .3H 2 0), and siderite (Fe 2 C0 3 ). The hematite ore or red-ochre is called 'ox­ide of iron'. It has ferrous content ranging from 60 to 70%. It is mainly found in the Dharwad and Cuddapah rocks of the Peninsular India.

## Steel
Steel is an alloy made up of iron with typically a few tenths of a percent of carbon to improve its strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. Many other elements may be present or added. Stainless steels that are corrosion- and oxidation-resistant typically need an additional 11% chromium.Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, steel is used in buildings
