## Understanding the Difference Between Silica Sand and Washed Sand
Silica sand consists of fine pieces of quartz and other minerals such as salt, silt, clay, dust and various powders. Washed sand goes through a cleaning or "washing" process that removes these additional substances. MS Industries is a provider of naturally occurring smaller sized silica sand with microproppants and proppants.
