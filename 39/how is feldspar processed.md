## Feldspar: Uses And Applications | African Pegmatite
Feldspar melts at an early stage in the overall firing process, efficiently and rapidly producing a glassy matrix that is responsible for holding the other materials in the melt together. Additionally, feldspar can give the glass enhanced desirable properties such as increased hardness, durability and resistance to chemical attack.
