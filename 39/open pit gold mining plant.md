## What consequence does open-pit mining most likely have on plant life?
How does open-pit mining affect the environment? Open-pit mining includes blasting of soil and vegetation to access underground ore layers or coal seams [17]. Consequently this method produces large volumes of mining waste including soil and overburden which increase the vulnerability of mining environments to soil erosion and pollution.

Open-pit mining technology. Open-pit mining clearly offers a number of economic advantages over underground mining, especially now that mineral-processing technology has advanced to the stage where very low-grade ores can be treated profitably. 100 to 150 years ago, this was not the case, and mining was still much more selective.
