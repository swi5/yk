## How Are Magnets Made In Nature - Realonomics
The iron ore magnetite also known as lodestone is a natural permanent magnet. Other permanent magnets can be made by subjecting certain materials to a magnetic force. When the force is removed these materials retain their own magnetic properties. . They are made by surrounding certain materials with a coil of wire.

Aug 08, 2019 Â· Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore, and magnetite, as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purification. Hematite, however, responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite, so it is the preferred type of ore.

The object of the separation, however, is twofold: the concentration of the mineral in the raw ore to a product of sufficient

## USA - Process for beneficiating magnetite iron ore - Google
A process for upgrading low-grade magnetite-containing iron ore with minimum fine grinding. The dry ore is first comminuted to between about three-fourths inch and 10 mesh particle size and magnetically separated. The dry tailing is discarded and the concentrate is ground to between about 20 and 100 mesh and again subjected to dry magnetic separation.

## Types of Iron Ore: Hematite vs. Magnetite
That makes the iron extraction process much less costly and time consuming. In addition, hematite ore only goes through one stage of screening and crushing, while magnetite ore has an additional round of processing. Types of iron ore: Magnetite. With the chemical formula Fe3O4, magnetite ore has much lower iron content than hematite ore.
