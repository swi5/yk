## Asbestos Fiber: History, Manufacturing Process and Uses
Nov 24, 2021Asbestos is obtainable by various underground mining methods, but the most common method is open-pit mining. Only about 6 percent of the mined ore contains usable fibers. The fibers are separated from the ore by crushing, air suction, and vibrating screens, and in the process are sorted into different lengths, or grades.

Most of the asbestos mining operations are of the open pit type, using bench drilling techniques. The fiber extraction (milling) process must be chosen so as to optimize recovery of the fibers in the ore, while minimizing reduction of fiber length. Dry milling operations are the most widely used.
