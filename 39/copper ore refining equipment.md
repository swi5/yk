## From Ore to Finished Product - Copper
Copper - From Beginning to End. Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man. It is found in ore deposits around the world. It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago. And as alloyed in bronze (copper-tin alloy) about 3000 BC, was the first engineering material known to man.

Mar 10, 2021 The copper ore beneficiation process generally adopts a relatively simple process. After one stage grinding, the fineness -200 mesh accounts for about 50% to 70%, 1 roughing, 2 to 3 selections, and 1 to 2 sweeping. If the copper mineral impregnation particle size is relatively fine, the stage grinding process can be considered.
