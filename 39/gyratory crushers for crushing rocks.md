## Use Range and Attentions of Gyratory Crusher - Luoyang Dahua
The gyratory crusher is a large crusher which makes use of the gyratory movement of the crushing cone in the inner cone cavity to extrude, split and bend the material for various kinds of rocks and stones. Gyratory crusher is a typical coarse crushing equipment in a large mineral dressing plant. Both gyratory crusher and jaw crusher can be used as coarse crushing machinery.

## Choosing the right crusher - Buying Guides DirectIndustry
A cone crusher can crush a variety of rocks, from medium to hard. The way a cone crusher operates is similar to how a gyratory crusher does, but in a cone crusher the slope in the breaking space is not as steep. Although it is known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, the cone crusher is better suited for secondary crushing.

Gyratory Crusher & Cone Crusher Mantle Differences. Jul 25, 2015 · In the Gyratory all the movement is in the bottom of the crusher mantle. This is due to the angle that the main shaft is on. The greater angle of the cone crusher puts the pivot point below the distributor plate. While the pivot point for the gyratory crusher is at the spider cap.

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency - Pit & Quarry
Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of a machine's work to the energy supplied to the machine. To apply what this means to your crusher, operations produce the exact sizes in the reduction process that their market demands. In the past, quarries produced a range of single-size aggregate products - up to 40 mm in size.

## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and developed by Gates around 1881 and were referred to as a Gates crusher [1]. The smaller form is described as a cone crusher. The larger crushers are normally known as primary crushers as they are designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines.

## How does gyratory crusher work?s
How does a gyratory cone crusher work? Gyratory crushers work on a similar principle to jaw crushers but have a circular gap. Rock is compressed between a static conical bowl and a concave mantle which oscillates about the central axis. These are generally designed for primary crushing in large-scale rock crushing applications up to 6000 t/h.

While cone crushers are usually supported at the base, gyratory crushers are suspended. Impact crushers, sometimes called "hammer crushers," use mass and velocity to break up pieces with a blow bar or hammer that strikes a stationary plate. When the rock hits the plate or anvil, it breaks on natural stress lines to create a uniform product.
