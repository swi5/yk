## Why are crystals rare? - Science Questions with Surprising Answers
As should now be evident, crystals are not rare. But pretty crystals seem to be rare. Why? The answer is twofold: erosion and mixed composition. Wind, rain, and water flow have a way of knocking and mixing around things here on earth. This erosion causes big crystals such as a palm-sized amethyst to get knocked apart into little crystals.

## Granite - Minerals Education Coalition
Description. Granite is the most widespread of igneous rocks, underlying much of the continental crust. Granite is an intrusive igneous rock. Intrusive rocks form from molten material (magma) that flows and solidifies underground, where magma cools slowly. Eventually, the overlying rocks are removed, exposing the granite.

Marble is made by regional metamorphism of limestone or dolomite rock, causing their microscopic grains to combine into larger crystals. This type of metamorphic rock consists of recrystallized calcite (in limestone) or dolomite (in dolomite rock). In this hand specimen of Vermont marble, the crystals are small.
