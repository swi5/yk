The mixed type leaching is a combination of spraying type and immersion type leaching methods, and both the flat-turn leacher and the rotary-turn leacher are representative of the equipment for mixed type leaching. The leaching method of oil production can be categorized into direct leaching and prepressing leaching by the production method.

## Leaching - Mining Fundamentals
The two main types of leaching are heap and insitu leaching. Heap Leaching. Heap leaching is also known as acid leaching. This method is most effective for the extraction of metals from difficult ores, and is one of the most tried and tested methods. The pre-processing of ore before leaching involves the grinding and roasting of the ore.
