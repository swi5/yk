Conical Ball Mills differ in mill body construction, which is composed of two cones and a short cylindrical part located between them (Fig. 2.12).Such a ball mill body is expedient because efficiency is appreciably increased. Peripheral velocity along the conical drum scales down in the direction from the cylindrical part to the discharge outlet; the helix angle of balls is decreased and

The mill consists of a rotating cylindrical drum; the ore enters one hollow trunnion and the finished product leaves the other. Modern practice indicates ball mill feeds of 1/2 in, 3/4 in, and 1 in (1.27 cm, 1.91 cm, and 2.54 cm) for hard, medium, and soft ores respectively and the products range from 35 to 200 mesh and finer.

## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
For both wet and dry ball mills, the ball mill is charged to approximately 33% with balls (range 30-45%). Pulp (crushed ore and water) fills another 15% of the drum's volume so that the total volume of the drum is 50% charged. Pulp is usually 75% solid (crushed ore) and 25% water; pulp is also known as ' slurry '.
