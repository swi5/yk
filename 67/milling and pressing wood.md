## Milling and Drying Cottonwood
If you can, use a blade with a little wider kerf and keep it sharp. Cottonwood tends to tear and drag on the sides of the blade, which builds up heat. Not so much of a problem with green wood, so you should be okay. I've found that dry cottonwood is the one of the most difficult species to mill. Just a little tip to make the job go easier.

Mat bulk density. Table 2 lists the bulk density of mats of wood particles, hammer milled straw and refined straw particles. Without any pressing, wood particle mats are much denser than straw particles. This, plus the fact that straw is waxy on surfaces, can lead to practical problems in maintaining the mat integrity for strawboard during transportation from the former to the press.

Cut Big Boards into Small Pieces. You might think the best strategy for milling rough lumber is to flatten as large a piece as possible, then cut it into smaller parts. Not true. It's better to cut a big roughsawn board into individual pieces, one for each part on your cutting list, more or less, and then start milling.
