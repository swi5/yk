The concentration of Ca in the manganese ore samples occurs in a range of 0.98 to 1.89, which is possibly due to the interaction of calcite veins in the manganese deposits of the study area. This CaO concentration is near to hydrothermal-hydrogenous manganese ore deposits, Hazara, Pakistan .

## Manganese ore concentration
There is a manganese ore concentration plant in Polunochnoje (North Ural) which was designed and built for entirely dry concentration processes. The use of this technology made it possible to receive a concentrate with 30% manganese content (up to 19% grade of mined ore), when it is extracted into the concentrate - 79%, the grade of manganese

The production of titanium metal accounts for only 5 percent of annual titanium mineral consumption; the rest goes to the titanium pigment industry. Pigments are produced using either a sulfate process or a more environmentally acceptable carbo-chlorination process (described below) that converts TiO2 into TiCl4. The latter process also supplies the TiCl4 necessary for the production of.

## Manganese
This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150 and 250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe 2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio.
