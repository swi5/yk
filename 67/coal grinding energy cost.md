Coal is also an affordable source of energy. Coal prices have historically been lower and more stable than oil and gas prices and it is likely to remain the most affordable fuel for power generation in many developed and industrialising countries for several decades. Coal-based electricity is well-established and highly reliable.

Coal Grinding - Cement Plant Optimization. Drying and grinding are generally being done in either air swept ball mill or a vertical mill. The selection of mill system will depend mostly on the factors like initial capital cost, drying and grinding capacity required, cost of energy (power) etc. Coal Fineness: It is understood generally that the finer we grind, the easy it is for burning

## Final report and evaluation of the Ilok 4-micron coal grinding process 
Increasing needs for pulverized coal necessitate more efficient grinding. Energy inefficiencies, equipment wear and maintenance are significant cost factors, as is the broad size range of resulting particles; in addition to the unnecessary cost of production, too many fines often make difficulties in processing and flowability; for other

## Coal grinding to obtain water-coal fuel
Coal grinding mills. In conventional systems, coal grinding is carried out using ball and rod mills. Depending on the process flow diagram and the type of coal mill, the specific power consumption is very high and ranges on the average from 50 to 250 kW·h/t. Such energy input arises due to a very low energy efficiency of the equipment used.
