## Qualitative and Mineralogical Characterization of Lead Deposit in 
A detailed mineralogical and elemental characterization of a lead (Pb) ore deposit from Ishiagu, Ebonyi State, Nigeria was carried out with XRD, SEM-EDX, and ICP-OES based mappingtechniques. The results show that the most dominant and valuable metal is lead (Pb = 95.02%, mass fraction). The main mineral is galena.
