## How it Works: Crushers, Grinding Mills and Pulverizers
Jaw crushers use mechanical pressure to break the material by forcing it between two vertical jaws, one stationary and one that is driven back and forth. The gap between the two jaws narrows as the material moves through the crusher, further reducing the size. Jaw crushers are heavy duty machines and can be used in mining or quarry applications

For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 Ã 1.7 = 78 cm.

## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

## Should I Choose an Impact Rock Crusher or Cone Crusher? - Sepro Aggregates
Cone Crusher Applications. Cone crushers, a type of compression crusher, have less versatility than a horizontal impact crusher, but a great capability to guarantee a finished product size. If set at 2", typically 80% of the final product will meet the 2" target which is not something that can be replicated by jaw crushers or impact crushers.
