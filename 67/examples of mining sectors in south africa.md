## South Africa: Developments In The Mining Sector In Sub-Saharan  - Mondaq
According to IJGlobal, there are at present 35 mining projects at the financing or pre-financing stage in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is worth noting that traditional project financing remains rare for mining projects in Sub-Saharan Africa, with one notable, recent exception being the bauxite mine and associated rail and port infrastructure project

## Expat jobs in mining | JobnetAfrica
Mining is a large sector in quite a few African countries and therefore there are also relatively a lot of expat jobs in mining in Africa. It differs per country what the most popular forms of mining are, but expat jobs in mining can be found in a wide range of mining, for example mining for copper, diamonds, gold and platinum.
