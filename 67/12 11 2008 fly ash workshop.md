## Fly ash floods Tennessee River > Appalachian Voices
By The Appalachian Voice | December 23, 2008. A six-foot wall of coal fly ash mud broke loose from an earthen dam early Monday morning near Harriman, TN, washing out a road, isolating a dozen homes and posing a possible threat to drinking water downstream from Watts Bar dam on the Tennessee River. No injuries have been officially reported

The major arsenic species in fly ash was reported to be As(V) (Silberman and Harris, 1984, Goodarzi and Huggins, 2001, Huggins et al., 2007).Since acidity constants (pK a) of arsenic acid (H 3 AsO 4) are 2.26, 6.76, and 11.29, respectively (), the neutral H 3 AsO 4 species dominates the system when pH < 2.3.

On December 22, 2008, a retention pond wall collapsed at TVA's Kingston plant in Harriman, TN, releasing a combination of water and fly ash that flooded 12 homes, spilled into nearby Watts Bar Lake, contaminated the Emory River, and caused a train wreck. Officials said 4 to 6 feet of material escaped from the pond to cover an estimated 400 acres of adjacent land.

## Special Issue "Current State of Coal Fly Ash Utilization 
In this study, polypropylene (PP) fibers with three lengths (6, 12, and 24 mm) and three mass percentages (0.5%, 1%, and 1.5%) were used to reinforce a coal fly ash soil (FAS) mixture. Unconsolidated, undrained triaxial tests were carried out in order to study the mechanical properties of the polypropylene fiber-reinforced FAS mixture and

## New Publication - Workshop report: Waste-to-Energy fly ash valorisation 
The webinar presentations clearly show that fly ash valorisation is a hot topic, especially as Circular Economy principles are slowly but surely unfolding into all aspects of society. Several technologies are (or will be) good candidates to contribute to more valorisation and/or re-use of WtE fly ash and possibly less hazardous waste landfilling.
