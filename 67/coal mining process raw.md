## Coal | Uses, Types, Pollution, & Facts | Britannica
coal, one of the most important primary fossil fuels, a solid carbon-rich material that is usually brown or black and most often occurs in stratified sedimentary deposits. Coal is defined as having more than 50 percent by weight (or 70 percent by volume) carbonaceous matter produced by the compaction and hardening of altered plant remains—namely, peat deposits. Different varieties of coal

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

Coal to Make Coke and Steel. Metallurgical coal (also called "met" coal) is an important raw material used in the steel-making process, although very small amounts of coal (relative to the amount used for electricity) are needed. The coal used to make steel is heated without air in an oven at temperatures of as much as 2,060°F (1,125°F

## Manage Your Cement or Coal Mix with PGNAA Technology - Advancing Mining
PGNAA and PFTNA online analyzers help cement producers save energy costs and reduce raw material waste. A stable cement manufacturing process with the correct chemistry takes much less energy to run than a highly variable process. The more variability in the raw materials, the more fuel the producer must use to get the materials to "react

## raw material found in coal mining
The U.S. coal industry serves a vital role in the nation's economy by producing fuel for more than half of its electricity. Despite the industry's importance, industry financial data for 2005—the strongest year for the coal industry in recent years—shows that it is a relatively small industry with revenues totaling $20 billion to $25 billion and net income between $1 billion and $2

## Study on Permeability Characteristics of Gas Bearing Coal under Cyclic Load
With the depletion of shallow coal mine resources, the mining depth of coal mines is deepening year by year, therefore, gas explosion and other disasters occur from time to time. Gas drainage is the main measure to prevent gas disasters, and the permeability of coal is one of the main factors affecting gas drainage. In order to explore the seepage characteristics of coal under different
