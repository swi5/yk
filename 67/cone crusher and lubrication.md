## How to do the lubrication of the cone crusher-Jiaozuo zhongxin heavy 
May 6, 2021The cone crusher adopts thin oil circulation lubrication. It has two kinds of lubrication systems: one is the oil pump driven by the power of the drive shaft, called the integral lubrication system; the other is the lubrication system driven by the oil pump alone. Most crushers are equipped with The lubrication system driven by the oil pump alone.

## Causes of high lube oil temperature
The lubricating properties of aero lubricating oil will change due to deterioration caused by high temperature, high pressure, and high shearing, along with metallic catalysis (i.e., copper and iron) under the conditions of being exposed to the air. The deteriorated oil will do harm to the functions of the engine afterwards [ 6, 7 ].

## Causes of high lube oil temperatureme.shop
Causes of High Oxidation While some new oils may produce an oxidation value due to the presence of synthetic esters, increases in oxidation generally represent degradation of the fluid. The biggest driver to oxidation is heat, as the rate of reaction doubles with every 10 °C or 18 °F increase in temperature.Causes: Factors to consider include temperature raised and grease used to lubricate.

Replace the oil pan and thrust plate. 2. Oil temperature and oil pressure rise. The oil pressure in the thin oil lubrication system of the cone crusher increases and the oil return temperature also rises accordingly. The reason. The oil pipe or the oil groove in the crusher parts is blocked, and the safety valve fails.

## Advantages of hydraulic cone crusher lubrication
Hydraulic cone crushers are widely used in metal and non-metal mines, cement plants, construction, sand and gravel metallurgy and other industries. Since the cone crusher often works under heavy conditions and in a bad environment, it is very necessary to keep the lubrication system oil path unblocked, the oil is clean, does not leak, and runs normally, which is very necessary to ensure the

## How to do the lubrication of the cone crusher-Jiaozuo zhongxin heavy 
The cone crusher adopts thin oil circulation lubrication. It has two kinds of lubrication systems: one is the oil pump driven by the power of the drive shaft, called the integral lubrication system; the other is the lubrication system driven by the oil pump alone. Most crushers are equipped with The lubrication system driven by the oil pump alone.
