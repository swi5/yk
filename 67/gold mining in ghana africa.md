Gold mines built by Chinese investors have destroyed water bodies in the heart of Ghana, Africa's second-largest gold producer. River pollution caused by digging up the surrounding land areas have led to deforestation, dying fish and undrinkable water. Some rivers have dried out completely, and deforestation has impoverished many local farmers.
