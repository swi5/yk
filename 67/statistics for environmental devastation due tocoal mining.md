## Environmental degradation in India's oldest coal mining belt leaves 
Decades of unabated coal mining can irreversibly change the character of an area and that is the story of Raniganj Coalfields, India's oldest coalfield area spread over West Bengal and parts of Jharkhand. Although mining started in this area in 1774, environmental degradation worsened when open-cast mines made their appearance 30 years ago.

Mining activities also give rise to the visual effects on the environment surrounding the mine including the release of methane into the atmosphere, the release of contaminated water and the generation of solid waste products.
