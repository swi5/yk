## Belt Conveyor Capacity
I recalculated Belt 1 and got the 6000 tons/hr with a freeboard of the ore from the belt edge of 170 mm. By using the same formula, I recalculated Belt 2 and got 2500 tons/hr with the same freeboard. After increasing the freeboard to 205 mm, the capacity reduced to 1800 tons/hr. As you said, "Seems simple enough".

16' Hay Elevator Base Unit. The basic unit comes in two 8′ pieces that easily go together. The 16′ unit needs a half horse power motor (sold separately). From there you can add 4′ or 8′ sections to make the conveyor as long as you need. Once you get to 24 feet in length you'll want to increase your motor to a 3/4 horse which we also.
