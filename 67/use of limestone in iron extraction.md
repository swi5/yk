## what is the role of limestone in extraction of iron?? - Youth4work
5 Answers. The main role of limestone in extraction of iron is to decomposes in hot furnace and form the calcium oxide. Iron is extracted from its ore, haematite, in a blast furnace. The ore is fed into the top of the furnace along with coke and limestone.  The limestone decomposes in the hot furnace, forming calcium oxide.

## Why limestone is added in the extraction of lead from galena?
Why is limestone added to the blast furnace during iron extraction? Limestone is also used to remove impurities from the blast furnace when making iron. The impurities are mostly silicon dioxide (also known as sand). The calcium carbonate in the limestone reacts with the silicon dioxide to form calcium silicate (also known as slag).

During iron making, iron ore, coke, heated air and limestone or other fluxes are fed into a blast furnace. The heated air causes the coke combustion, which provides the heat and carbon sources for iron production. Limestone or other fluxes may be added to react with and remove the acidic impurities, called slag, from the molten iron.

Mar 26, 2020 · Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however, because iron does not occur naturally, it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.
