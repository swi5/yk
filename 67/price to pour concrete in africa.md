4 รท 12 = .33. 100 x .33 = 33 cubic feet. 33 x .037 = 1.22 cubic yards. Essentially you are solving for volume and then converting to cubic yards. For concrete, the formula for volume is as follows: length x width x thickness. To determine how many bags of concrete you will need, divide the total cubic yards needed by the yield.
