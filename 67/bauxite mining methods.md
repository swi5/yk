Mining Immediately prior to mining any deposit, the land is cleared and the top soil, to a minimum of 6 inches, removed and stockpiled for later replacement when mining is completed. The surface occurrence of the ore (usually less than 100 feet) makes the deposits suitable for mining by simple opencast methods.

Bauxite is a sedimentary rock with a relatively high aluminium content. It is the world's main source of aluminium and gallium.Bauxite consists mostly of the aluminium minerals gibbsite (Al(OH) 3), boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) and diaspore (α-AlO(OH)), mixed with the two iron oxides goethite (FeO(OH)) and haematite (Fe 2 O 3), the aluminium clay mineral kaolinite (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4) and small

Oct 15, 2020The methods used in mining bauxite differ somewhat in different countries and with different types of deposits. In deposits occurring in the form of extensive surface blankets or in beds and lenses interlayered with unconsolidated sediments, such as are being mined in Arkansas and in northern South America, quarrying is a common method of mining.

Surface mining is more common than underground mining because most of the bauxite deposits occur near the surface.

Bauxite is mined by surface methods (open-cut mining) in which the topsoil and overburden are removed by bulldozers and scrapers. The topsoil is then stored and later used for revegetating and restoring the area after mining is completed. The underlying bauxite is mined by front-end loaders, power shovels or hydraulic excavators.
