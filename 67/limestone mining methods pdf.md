Jul 15, 2021Therefore, the underground mining of limestone is the best sustainable method of mining limestone in the future. Recall that limestone is a mineral of low value found near the Earth's surface. Its current production in India is through surface mines using either opencast (stripping and hill mining) or open-pit mining methods.

## Environmental and social impacts of mining - WRM
Environmental and social impacts of mining. Mining is a short-term activity with long-term effects. There can be no doubt that when it takes place in forest zones, it is a factor of degradation. It is calculated that, together with oil prospecting, mining is threatening 38% of the last stretches of the world's primary forests.

## Opencast Mining (Quarrying): Methods, Advantages & Disadvantages 
Opencast mining or quarrying of minerals is easier than mining by underground methods. During quarrying the alluvium and rocks below which the minerals lie, are removed and dumped, in the initial stages, in a place which is not required in future for quarrying, residential or other purposes. The mineral exposed is completely extracted.
