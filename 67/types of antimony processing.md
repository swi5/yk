Jan 14, 2021The above is an introduction to 3 commonly used antimony ore beneficiation processes. Among them, the gravity beneficiation process is the most used process. One is because most types of antimony ore have high density and coarse particles, and the beneficiation index can be directly achieved by gravity separation.
