## Strip Mining | Encyclopedia
Strip mining is used for mining phosphate fertilizer in Florida, North Carolina, and Idaho, and for obtaining gypsum (mainly for wallboard) in western states. However, the most common association of strip mining is with coal . The examples of decimated land in Appalachia have motivated calls for prevention, or at least major efforts at reclamation.

## Strip Mining: A Destructive Way of Coal Extraction
This is because by definition the process of strip mining involves striping away trees, plants and topsoil so that the coal can be accessed underneath. This means that surface mining destroys mountain tops, landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats. On top of that, it leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land.

1. It's cheaper than other mining methods. At first glance, mountaintop removal might seem expensive. Explosives, for one thing, aren't exactly cheap, especially since millions of pounds are needed for a single mountain. The earth-moving machines used in digging up coal are also pricey, with some costing approximately $100 million.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Strip Cropping
Strip cropping helps to stop soil erosion by creating natural dams for water, helping to preserve the strength of the soil. Certain layers of plants will absorb minerals and water from the soil more effectively than others. When water reaches the weaker soil that lacks the minerals needed to make it stronger, it normally washes it away.
