## Iron Ore Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.

Minex companies and the Geological Survey but economic Ni-Cu deposits have yet to be identified. The Ubendian Belt grouping in the Chitipa-Karonga area of northern Malawi comprise 17 mafic-ultramafic bodies emplaced synkinematically into the host c.2Ga gneisses. The Mzuzu grouping includes four pyroxenitic bodies and four noritic bodies.
