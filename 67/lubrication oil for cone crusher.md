Lubrication is an important maintenance step for the cone crusher. Good lubrication can protect the equipment and extend the service life of the cone crusher. When we use the equipment, we will have poor lubrication. What factors will cause this phenomenon? First, the temperature changes. The oil in the cone crusher varies with temperature.

## Crushing Machinery And Cone Crusher - Centrifugal Oil Filter For Cone 
One of the key operating systems on a cone crusher is the lube oil circuit. On larger crushers, the lube circuit pushes more than 800 liters of oil per minute through the crusher bearings. However these crushers run in some of the worst dirt filled environments. Airborne dirt continuously crosses through the bearing seals, dumping a tremendous

## Causes of high lube oil temperature
The lubricating properties of aero lubricating oil will change due to deterioration caused by high temperature, high pressure, and high shearing, along with metallic catalysis (i.e., copper and iron) under the conditions of being exposed to the air. The deteriorated oil will do harm to the functions of the engine afterwards [ 6, 7 ].
