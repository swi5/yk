Copper is extracted from its ore through heap leaching process. Heap leaching is an industrial mining process which involves a series of chemical reactions to absorb target minerals and separate them from other earth materials. Cu-Ore (Cu2S) of . 11 mm particle size is spread with Conc. H2SO4 (88%) pelletized to get a particle size of ~ 16 mm.

Most copper leaching is done by piling broken ore (∼0.5% Cu) into flat-surface, 3-10m high, 10 4 -10 5 m 2 heaps of ore and then sprinkling dilute sulfuric acid lixiviant on to the heap surface. The lixiviant trickles down through the heap and leaches copper from its minerals to produce a pregnant leach solution containing 1-5kg Cum −3.

## Outotec copper concentrate pressure leaching process
The Copper Pressure Oxidation Plant is an Outotec proprietary technology for impure concentrate refining. The new process offers an effective way to dissolve concentrate, remove impurities, and recover copper as LME A-grade cathodes. In addition, the flowsheet can be modified to recover silver and gold. It is an easy-to-operate, self-optimizing
