A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
