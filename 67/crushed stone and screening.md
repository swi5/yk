## What is screening stone?
What are gravel screenings? Screenings are a pulverized byproduct of the stone-crushing process at quarries and rock yards. The size of screenings are generally 3/8″ down to dust, and are made up of whatever type of rock it is that is being crushed - most commonly limestone or granite.

## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
Crushed stone: The term "crushed stone" usually refers to stone that has a mixture of stone dust in it. This type of stone is best used for a base when heavy compaction is needed. As a result, it is typically used for the base of concrete and paving projects, foundations of structures, and driveway bases.

## Screening of crushed stone - an economical material for use in construction
In winter, screening of crushed stone is widely used for sprinkling slippery sections of the road surface. The structure, specific gravity and optimal particle size of this material provide an excellent anti-slip effect, in addition, screening is safe for the environment, since it does not contain chemical reagents in its composition.

## crushed stone and screening
Crushed stone aggregates are produced by crushing quarried rock, then screening it to sizes appropriate for the intended use. Production of crushed stone has three stages: Primary crushing to break down the stone to a manageable size; secondary and tertiary crushing to render the rocks into sizes specific to their applications; and screening to separate the crushed stone for further processing

In most crushed-stone operations, this process occurs after the shotrock has been processed by a primary crusher. The role of screening in the processing flow is to size and separate material ahead of secondary and tertiary crushing circuits, and/or to size and separate material in preparation for final product stockpiling.
