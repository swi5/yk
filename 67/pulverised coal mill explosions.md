## Coal Mill Safety
VG: At best, coal mill safety is not well understood and, at worst, it is ignored. When it comes to coal mill systems, most cement plant operators just presume that the supplier of the equipment knows all of the standards and rules and is 100% capable of making a system that conforms to these and is therefore safe. However, this is not the case.
