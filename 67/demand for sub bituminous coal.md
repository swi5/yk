Oct 19, 2021Subbituminous coal has a higher heating value than lignite. Subbituminous coal typically contains 35%-45% carbon, compared with 25%-35% for lignite. About 46% of the coal produced in the United States in 2020 was subbituminous. Bituminous coal contains 45%-86% carbon and has two to three times the heating value of lignite.

Sub-bituminous coal is a lower grade of coal that contains 35-45% carbon. The properties of this type are between those of lignite, the lowest grade of coal, and those of bituminous coal, the second-highest grade of coal. Sub-bituminous coal is primarily used as a fuel for steam-electric power generation

Bituminous and sub-bituminous coal represents more than 90 percent of all the coal consumed in the United States. When burned, the coal produces a high, white flame. Bituminous coal is so-called because it contains a tar-like substance called bitumen. There are two types of bituminous coal: thermal and metallurgical.

Bituminous coal. Bituminous coal is an organic sedimentary rock formed by diagenetic and sub metamorphic compression of peat bog material. It is also called as black coal. It is often referred to as soft coal. However, this designation is a layman's term and has little to do with the hardness of the rock.

Bituminous and sub-bituminous coal represents more than 90 percent of all the coal consumed in the United States. When burned, the coal produces a high, white flame. Bituminous coal is so-called because it contains a tar-like substance called bitumen. There are two types of bituminous coal: thermal and metallurgical.

## Sub-bituminous Coal | SHS Coal
Sub-Bituminous Coal. Sub bituminous coal is lignite that has been subjected to an increased level of organic metamorphism. This metamorphism has driven off some of the oxygen and hydrogen in the coal. That loss produces coal with higher carbon content up to 71% to 77% on a dry ash-free basis. Contact us.
