Scoria is an igneous rock that is dark-colored with abundant bubble-like cavities called vesicles. Scoria's color can range from black or dark gray to a deep reddish brown. It has a composition similar to that of basalt, or can also have a composition similar to andesite. The small pieces of scoria look like the ash produced in a coal furnace resulting in particles of scoria being called cinders.
