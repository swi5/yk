## 10 Advantages and Disadvantages of Quarrying Limestone
The market for limestone is remarkably consistent. Quarried limestone can be used to neutralize acidity, so it can be added to soils or lakes. Limestone is used in the iron manufacturing industry, is required for cement, concrete, and mortar mixes, and is heated with sand and sodium carbonate to create glass. 3. It is extremely affordable.

## environmental impact mining limestone
How Does Limestone Affect the Environment? While limestone itself doesn't affect the environment, limestone mining can have a negative impact. On the other hand, the environment can affect limestone by breaking it down. Limestone mining can pollute water and create sinkholes.

## What Effect Does Limestone Have On The Environment
Mining limestone can damage the environment because to mine limestone we need bombs,Big machines and trucks. The steps to mining limestone is by putting a bomb in a quarry. When the bomb explodes we get limestone. Then to transport limestone we need big machines that can turn them into bricks so they are easy to carry.

## Environmental Hazards of Limestone Mining - Seattle PI
Limestone mines use two types of blasting. Small explosive charges set along drilled lines free blocks of stone to be removed for construction. Large charges reduce whole areas of limestone to rubble, which is removed for use as crushed stone. The noise, dust, and impact from explosions can result in noise pollution and dust.
