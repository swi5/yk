## Types of Road Pavement in Construction: 6 Important Points
Flexible pavement is made of multiple layers named surface course, base course, sub-base, capping, and lastly the Geogrid. The surface layer is made of Asphalt material. It is further categorized into two materials named Thin Surface course System (TSCS) and Hot Tolled Asphalt (HRA). Surface Course. Base Course.
