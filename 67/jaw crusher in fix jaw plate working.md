These non-choking jaw plates have been developed in two styles, reversible and non-reversible. The advantage of the reversible design has been outlined in connection with its application to the gyratory reduction crusher. For both types of jaw plate, the effective receiving opening is reduced, as compared to the standard, straight-plate setup.

## Jaw Plate Failure and Life - Crushing, Screening & Conveying 
Too many fines can accelerate jaw plate wear. What happens is the fines will fill the jaw plate corrugations or valleys. These valleys are necessary for the crusher to crush efficiently. Filling the valleys with fines creates an event called compaction. Normally a jaw crusher will squeeze the material between the stationary and moving jaw plates.

Keep the toggle area clean, particularly before any crusher adjustments. It's best to wash out the toggle seats and plates daily, as wet material buildup results in a gritty compound that grinds down components, causing premature wear. Also, remove dirt and debris from crusher frame surfaces and from areas around the machine.
