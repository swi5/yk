The Density of Gold. Gold has a density of 19.32 grams per cubic centimeter, ranking it as one of the densest metals on Earth. Many people are confused by the terms density and gravity, but the two refer to the same thing. Density is the mass of a gold item relative to its volume. In scientific terms, density is unit mass per unit volume—for

## gold processing | Britannica
gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

Native gold is an element and a mineral. It is highly prized by people because of its attractive color, its rarity, resistance to tarnish, and its many special properties - some of which are unique to gold. No other element has more uses than gold. All of these factors help support a price of gold that is higher than all but a few other metals.

The actual identification of the oxide was made a few years later by a German chemist, M.H. Klaproth, who gave the metal constituent of this oxide the name titanium, after the Titans of Greek mythology.

## Gold in Quartz - How to Calculate the Gold Content
To explain that in other words, the specific gravity of gold is 19.3 which means the weight of gold is 19.3 times that of an equivalent volume of water (at 4 degrees C). If water weight is 1 gram per ml then Gold at an SG of 19.3 is 19.3 times as dense as water or 19.3 grams
