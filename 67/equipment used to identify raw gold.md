## How To Test If Gold Is Real | Test Methods | NYC Bullion
The porcelain tile test, also known as the gold scratch test, requires a ceramic plate or a piece of unglazed porcelain tile. Scratch or rub your gold across the tile/plate and take a look at the color of the streak. A golden, yellow streak indicates real gold while a black streak shows that your item is fake or it's pyrite.
