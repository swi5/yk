## Collaborative blast optimisation in a limestone mine - Quarry
Boral's Limestone Mine near Marulan in southern New South Wales is the source of limestone for up to 60 per cent of all cement products used in the state. It has operated since the 1830s, and today it is Boral's largest mining operation in Australia. The mine blasts 3.5 million tonnes of rock a year using modern open-cut hard rock drill and

## Is limestone used in coal mines? - Origin of coal
Why is limestone scattered around a coal mine? Limestone powder, known as rock dust, is spread throughout the mine workings on a regular basis. .. When explosions do occur, the dispersed limestone powder absorbs the heat generated from the explosion and will either stop the chain reaction or reduce the intensity of the explosion.

## CDC - Mining Feature - Coal Mine Explosion Prevention - NIOSH
Underground coal mining produces finely divided coal dust that deposits throughout the mine and serves as a source of combustible material for coal dust explosions. Limestone powder, known as rock dust, is spread throughout the mine workings on a regular basis. This rock dust serves to inert the coal dust when applied in the proper proportion.

In this part of Florida, groundwater is very near the surface. So as the rock is mined, the quarry pits fill with water. These lakes range from 30 to 50 feet deep and cover a total of about 4,900 acres.
