## What are the Benefits of Silica for Plants | Harvest Gold Organics
Silica creates a protective measure against animals, bacteria, and fungi in a couple of ways. One is that the composition of the plant itself becomes less palatable. A second is that the molecular structure is such that it becomes less digestible. A third protective measure is the ability to entice its predators.

## From sandy beach to Kaby Lake: How sand becomes silicon
Silica sand is also known as silicon dioxide, and as you've no doubt guessed from the name it's a compound of silicon and oxygen. To get the silicon, the oxygen is removed by mixing it with carbon

## Polysilicon - from Sand to Solar Cells, it Starts Here
The purity of polysilicon used for solar cells is very high, about 99.999% or higher! The pure polysilicon thus formed is first converted into ingots (a solid, brick-like material). These ingots are further cut into thin wafers by specially designed saws. The wafers are then fabricated into solar cells.
