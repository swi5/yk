## Method for the removal of iron pyrites from coal and carbon structures 
ConentionaI pyrites removal methods such as gravity separation, magnetic separation, and flotation can then be employed. Gravity separation is particularly enhanced as the organic coal matrix achieves a lower than normal density after hydrofluoric acid leaching, due to the dissolution of ash-fonaing ms nerals, thereby increasing the density

## Advances in depressants used for pyrite flotation separation from coal 
Pyrite is separated from other minerals mainly by flotation. However, the hydrophilicity of pyrite is affected by many factors, causing it to easily enter the concentrate and consequently reduce the quality of concentrate. Highly efficient pyrite depressants can be selectively adsorbed on the surface of pyrite to improve its hydrophilicity, thereby increasing the flotation separation

## Pyrite
Pyrite's metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold, hence the well-known nickname of fool's gold.The color has also led to the nicknames brass, brazzle, and Brazil, primarily used to refer to pyrite found in coal.. The name pyrite is derived from the Greek πυρίτης λίθος (pyritēs lithos), "stone or mineral which strikes fire", in turn from

## Pyrite Uses In Coal Mills
Pyrite and Coal Mining Sulfur occurs in coal in three different forms 1) .Aug 01, 2021 Pyrite from tailings needs to be recovered not only to reduce drainage acidification (acid mine drainage), but for industrial purposes, because pyrite is an iron disulfide that can be used as an electrode in photoelectrochemical cells, rechargeable
