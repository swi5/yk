##  Assessment of Potentially Harmful Arsenic, Cadmium, Cobalt and Lead in 
A number of environmental studies previously conducted in the Tsumeb Mining district analysed total metal concentrations in soils and vegetation; with results showing high concentrations of heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead and zinc which exceed international guidelines for different land uses.

Tsumeb, company town, north-central Namibia. At an elevation of 4,232 feet (1,290 m), the town is a northern terminus of the country's north-south railway and lies on a main trunk highway about 275 miles (440 km) north of Windhoek, the capital. In 1851 Sir Francis Galton, a British explorer, made note of copper ore deposits in the vicinity of what later became the town of Tsumeb.

## The use of gravity and magnetic separation to recover copper and lead 
The use of gravity or magnetic separation followed by upgrading on a shaking table recovered about 25 per cent of the copper and lead minerals, at a combined metal grade of 20 per cent, from the final flotation tailing at the Tsumeb Mine. Magnetic separation recovered the copper minerals more efficiently than the lead minerals; it also recovered finer particles more efficiently than standard
