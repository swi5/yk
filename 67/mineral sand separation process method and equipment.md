## Electrostatic Separation of Minerals | Bunting - Redditch
Electrostatic separation enables the separation of a wide range of minerals and this example, separating Pyrite from Silica Sand, provides a good example of the separation process. A feed of conducting (Pyrite FeS 2 ) and non-conducting (Silica Sand SiO 2 ) powders is fed via a vibratory feeder onto an earthed, stainless-steel roll revolving at

Adding foaming agent and inflate to produce bubbles, attach hydrophobic mineral particles to bubbles, and then float and separate. Floatation can usually deal with materials smaller than 0.2~0.3mm. In principle, it can separate all kinds of mineral raw materials, which is one of the most widely used methods.
