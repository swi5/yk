## Iron ore mining and dressing - tec-science
Regions in which iron ore has formed over millions of years (e.g. through volcanism) and can be mined economically are also referred to as iron ore deposits. Especially many ore deposits can be found in countries such as China, Australia, Brazil, India and Russia. These countries account for around 85 % of the total global iron ore mining volume.

Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental concerns linked to iron ore mining. This is because of the combustion-related emissions caused by equipment, including products like nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulphur dioxide. In fact, the global iron and steel industry accounts for approximately 5% of total global CO2

Resource-replacement capex by iron ore and coal producers is expected to be around $10 billion between 2018 and 2022. This largely reflects plans by major iron ore miners to build large replacement mines, with spending on front-end planning and engineering work for a number of these mines beginning in 2017.

## Iron ore
Mining iron ore is a high-volume, low-margin business, as the value of iron is significantly lower than base metals. It is highly capital intensive,  China is followed by Japan and Korea, which consume a significant amount of raw iron ore and metallurgical coal. In 2006, China produced 588 million tons of iron ore, with an annual growth of 38%.
