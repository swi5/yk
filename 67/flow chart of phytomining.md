## Phytomining: how to mine a tree | Feature | RSC Education
Plants suitable for phytomining are called hyperaccumulators because they accumulate large amounts of metals in their tissues and sap. Most plants don't grow well in metal-contaminated soil, and the ones that can thrive mainly do so by leaving the toxins in the soil, not absorbing them. Hyperaccumulators, however, employ a different approach

## Phytomining - Trends in Plant Science
Phytomining is the production of a `crop' of a metal by growing high-biomass plants that accumulate high metal concentrations. Some of these plants are natural hyperaccumulators, and in others the property can be induced. Pioneering experiments in this field might lead to a `green' alternative to existing, environmentally destructive, opencast mining practices.

## Phytomining: Can plants really grow gold? - Manhattan Gold & Silver
The method of using plants to extract particles of gold from soil is called phytomining. It works by taking a fast-growing plant with leafy mass, such as mustard, sunflowers or tobacco, and planting the crop on soil that contains gold. Once the plants grow to their maximum height, the soil is then treated with a chemical to make the gold soluble.
