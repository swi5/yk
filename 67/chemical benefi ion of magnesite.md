This chemically patina effect on aluminum and may be reduced to form small particles of copper. These copper particles, in turn, can cause local pitting corrosion of aluminum [3]. Closer to the touch - More corrosion.

## What is the chemical formula of magnesium phosphate? How is it  - Quora
Answer (1 of 7): Magnesium phosphate is Mg3(PO4)2. Okay, onto how I found that: Magnesium phosphate is an ionic compound, because firstly, there is no numerical prefix on the second word of the name, so we know it is not a covalent compound. In the names of ionic compounds, the first word is a

## Nomenclature, a collection of rules for-job
The anion is named by taking the elemental name, removing the ending, and adding "-ide.". 28. Write the chemical formula for each ionic compound below. aluminum bromide  (Na) is +1 and the chloride is 1. In MgO the magnesium is +2 and the oxygen (O) is 2 and so again the charges cancel each other out. Remember the charges come from the chart

## Liquid Magnesium: Benefits, Uses & Side Effects | Organic Facts
Magnesium affects the production of serotonin - a chemical essential for brain health and considered key in for mental health and happiness. Research by George A. Eby III et al., magnesium deficiency can decrease the levels of serotonin in the brain, and it is therefore important for mental health that the body gets enough of this mineral. [3
