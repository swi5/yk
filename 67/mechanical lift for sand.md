## Hydraulic Lift or Mechanical Lift? - CIP - Custom Industrial Products
Mechanical lifts are operated through cable lifting systems, and they work well when lifting both small or large loads between two or more levels. Because of their mechanical operation, they use less moving parts and components to operate. This means far less maintenance over the life of the lift, leading to long-term savings of time and money.
