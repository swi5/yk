Mechanical lifts, often referred to as Hoyer lifts, are devices designed to help caregivers move a person from a sitting to standing position and from one place to another within a room or house. There are three main types of mechanical lifts: passive floor lifts, overhead lifts, and active sit-to-stand lifts. When deciding if a mechanical lift

## Hydraulic Lift or Mechanical Lift? - CIP - Custom Industrial Products
Mechanical lifts are operated through cable lifting systems, and they work well when lifting both small or large loads between two or more levels. Because of their mechanical operation, they use less moving parts and components to operate. This means far less maintenance over the life of the lift, leading to long-term savings of time and money.
