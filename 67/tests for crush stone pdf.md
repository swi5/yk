## Crushed Stone & Clear Stone | Greely Sand & Gravel Inc.
The grey, angular stone commonly called gravel is usually limestone that has been crushed to achieve a desired size. Crushed Stone is gravel that includes pieces of all sizes usually from ⅞" all the way down to stone dust. The pieces are all mixed together, allowing them to compact together, creating a strong and stable surface.

The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.
