## Coal Processing Methods
More coal processing is done in foreign coal-producing countries because of their requirements for a smokeless fuel, their need to make a satisfactory metallurgical coke from inferior quality coals, and their general lack of indigenous oil or gas from which to produce chemicals or other carbon-based products. High-Temperature Carbonization

## Metallurgical Coke - IspatGuru
Metallurgical coke or 'Met coke' or 'BF (blast furnace) coke' or simply 'coke in short' is a hard carbon material produced in the process of the 'destructive distillation' of various blends of bituminous coal. It is produced by carbonization of coal at high temperatures (1,100 deg C) in an oxygen deficient atmosphere in a coke oven.

Coke gas (also called foul gas) contains coke tars, ammonia, and light oils. Tars are recovered and used to make tar derivatives. Ammonia is recovered as an aqueous

## What are Coal and Coke? - Reibus International
The combination of smaller coal pieces and the use of multiple small coking ovens increases the surface area of the coal that is exposed to the heat, which speeds the coking process. At the coking oven, a larry car is used to fill each small oven with the blended coal. Then the coal is heated to 1,800°F for approximately 18 hours.

## How does coke and coal play into steel making?
Quality of coal In either coke or non-coked coal, the quality of the coal affects the quality of the steel. Metallurgical coke is made from bituminous coals by a distillation process. Ash deposited by the coal must be kept to a minimum, preferably below 10% of the original mass.

## Why is Coke considered a better fuel than coal?
Coke is a fuel obtained from the dry calcination or distillation of coal. It is composed of carbon and has a high calorific value, but is highly polluting. It is used as a fuel in the blast furnaces of steel foundries. The method of producing coke began around 1800, although its production by simple methods had been known for centuries.

The blended coal mass is heated for 12 to 20 hours for metallurgical coke. Thermal energy from the walls of the coke chamber heats the coal mass by conduction from the sides to the middle of the coke chamber. During the coking process, the charge is in direct contact with the heated wall surfaces and develops into an aggregate "plastic zone".

On average, about 630 kilograms of coke are required to produce 1 metric ton of steel. Production efficiency in the blast furnace process is highly dependent upon the quality of raw materials used. A blast furnace fed with high-quality coke will require less coke and flux, lowering production costs and resulting in a better hot metal.
