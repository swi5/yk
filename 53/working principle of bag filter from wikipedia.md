The working principle of a multigrade filter is quite straight forward. In a multigrade filter or pressure sand filter, water is passed through multi layers of filter media consisting graded sand, pebbles and gravels layers.

Working Principle of Bag filter Air along with dust particles under suction or pressure enters the lower portion i.e. hopper of the bag filter. The air travels through the filter bag, which retains the dust particles on surface of the bag, and the clean air passes out through bags and plenum to the outlet of Bag filter.
