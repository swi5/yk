## Automatic flushing of sand traps to make them more efficient
The sand or other organic matter (wood, leaves, etc.) must be flushed from the sand trap regularly. This cleaning is currently performed manually and covers the whole sand trap. The Ark's project was launched in order to implement an automatic flushing system, controlled remotely via sensors. The aim was to minimise not only the water wasted

## Sediment Flushing of Reservoirs under Environmental Considerations 
where ψ= constant related to sediment type, size and flushing type which is 1600 for this case, Q f = flow discharge, S= water level slope during flushing and W= average of flow width during flushing. Parameters Q f, Sand Ware determined using the results of hydrodynamic model. This equation is an empirical relation derived and verified with field data in different countries.
