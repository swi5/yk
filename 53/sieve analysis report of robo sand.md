weight is the weight of the sand from -1 added to the 0 phi weight of sand. So 2.95 + 4.95 = 7.90, and the 1 phi cumulative weight is 7.90 + 13.36 = 21.26, etc. Weight percent is the total weight of Sieve Fraction Divided into each weight of the sand fractions. Thus for -1 phi 2.95 is divided by 33.42 then times 100 = 8.83 %.

## How to do a Sieve Analysis - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
A sieve analysis of the ore will often supply information of considerable value. This may start at about 20 mesh and include the range of sizes to and including 325 mesh. A portion of each sieve size should be examined under the microscope and assayed for gold and silver. A sample also should be separated into a sand portion and a slime portion.

## Sieve analysis
A sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used in civil engineering and chemical engineering to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material by allowing the material to pass through a series of sieves of progressively smaller mesh size and weighing the amount of material that is stopped by each sieve as a fraction of the whole mass.

## Sand Sieve Analysis Lab Report | PDF | Concrete | Materials
Engineering B45 Sand Sieve Analysis Lab Report Introduction: A great many materials used by the engineer are. comprised of an agglomeration of smaller units. Probably the most obvious example is that of concrete in which gravel, sand and cement are mixed together to form a monolithic (literally, one-stone) engineering material.

## Sieve Analysis | 4 Types of Sieves | Lab Procedure | Advantages 
The main importance of sieve analysis in civil engineering can be listed as follows: 1. It is necessary for design purposes. The process of concrete mix design is greatly influenced by the size of coarse aggregates to be used. 2. It is necessary to predict the quality and performance of the soil sample. 3.
