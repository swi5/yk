(Also Called: Crush and Run) Crusher run is a blended mix of coarse aggregate and fine aggregate. The combination of both crushed stone and stone dust creates a low void content (the amount of space or air between the pieces of rock in a mix) that is valuable in concrete construction for its compaction ability and drainage characteristics.

## sand and aggregates, crushing, maximum yield - The Weir Group
Igneous rocks, such as basalt and granite, are an excellent source of aggregate because they are hard, tough, and dense. Sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, are more challenging than igneous rocks to crush. When crushed with conventional compression type crushers they tend to fracture into flat or elongated pieces.
