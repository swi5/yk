Things to Remember. When coal is old, the content of carbon in it is higher. Carbon dioxide gas is produced when coal is burnt. The extraction of coal cost is high, while the extraction of petroleum cost is low. Coal and petroleum resources are limited. About 40% of petroleum is used to produce the world's electricity.

The Thermodynamics of Steam Turbines.Steam turbines operate on the principle of thermodynamics. The superheat or dry saturated steam vapor enters the turbine after having been heated by the boiler at a high temperature and pressure. It then passes through a nozzle on the turbine and as it exits the nozzle it is directed at a high velocity. All the turbine bearings are checked for following :-.

## What are the different types of coal? - American Geosciences Institute
The coal formation process involves the burial of peat, which is made of partly decayed plant materials, deep underground. The heat and pressure of burial alters the texture and increases the carbon content of the peat, which transforms it into coal, a type of sedimentary rock. This process takes millions of years. Types, or "ranks," of coal are determined by carbon content. There are four
