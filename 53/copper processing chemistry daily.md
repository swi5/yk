## Copper Facts: Chemical and Physical Properties - ThoughtCo
The modern name copper first came into use around 1530. Properties: Copper has a melting point of 1083.4 +/- 0.2°C, boiling point of 2567°C, specific gravity of 8.96 (20°C), with a valence of 1 or 2. Copper is reddish colored and takes a bright metallic luster. It is malleable, ductile, and a good conductor of electricity and heat.

## Uses of Copper | Supply, Demand, Production, Resources - Geology
Copper - A Metal Used Through The Ages. Copper was one of the first metals ever extracted and used by humans, and it has made vital contributions to sustaining and improving society since the dawn of civilization. Copper was first used in coins and ornaments starting about 8000 B.C., and at about 5500 B.C., copper tools helped civilization emerge from the Stone Age.

Copper Ore Processing Methods. The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining, concentrating, smelting, and refining. In a few instances, however, leaching takes the place of concentrating, smelting, and refining. At present, although considerable leaching and direct-smelting ores are produced, the bulk of the copper ore

The purification uses an electrolyte of copper(II) sulphate solution, impure copper anodes, and strips of high purity copper for the cathodes. The diagram shows a very simplified view of a cell. At the cathode, copper(II) ions are deposited as copper. At the anode, copper goes into solution as copper(II) ions.

Before 1982 U.S. pennies were pure copper. Now they are mostly zinc with a thin shell of copper. Most copper that is mined today is refined and drawn into wire for use in the electrical industries. A significant portion is also used in manufacturing water pipe. Copper, of course, has a characteristic color which most people recognize.

The reaction of these processes can be written as: 2CuFeS2+2SiO2+4O2 → Cu2S+2FeSiO3+3SO2. The copper extracted from this process is mixed with the slag and is called Matte Copper due to its texture and appearance. This mainly consists of Cu2S which is reduced to pure metal by blasting Matte Copper with air. Cu2 S+O2 → 2Cu+SO2.

In addition process gases or copper can diffuse into the ILD and cause damage and thus increasing the permittivity or leakage. To counteract this issues, the pores have to be distributed evenly and must not be in contact with each other.

## Chemistry of Copper, the Transition Metal | Science Facts
Chemistry, Earth Copper is used in coins, pipes, electrical wiring, electronic components, and the human body. Copper is a transition element and has the symbol Cu and atomic number 29. It is a reddish-colored metal, is malleable and ductile, is resistant to corrosion, and is a good conductor of heat and electricity.
