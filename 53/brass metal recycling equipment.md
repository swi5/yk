Common items made from red brass include pump equipment, irrigation sprinklers, and water meters. When recycling brass, it is important to make sure that it is clean. Otherwise, you may not be paid the full value for your metal. For it to be considered clean, you should make sure that there are no non-brass contaminants remaining.

Mining is an energy-intensive and environmentally damaging process, even more so than the creation of metals, and metal ores are a limited natural resource. BRASS IS INFINITELY RECYCLABLE.
