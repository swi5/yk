If no gold or native silver can be seen in the rock, take a representative sample of about 300 grams and grind it up to pass a No. 30 sieve. Weigh out 250 grams and carefully pan down until most of the gangue is removed. Examine the heavy residuum for metallics. Should any be found it will be well to see how much can be amalgamated.
