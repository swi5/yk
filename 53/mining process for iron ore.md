## The Six Main Steps of Iron Ore Processing | Multotec Canada
Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing. This step prevents overloading the crusher and increases its efficiency.

## How is Iron Ore Mined
The iron ore that is blasted is stacked and loaded upon large dumpers to be moved to the blast furnaces for smelting process. Benches are made for the process of iron ore mining. Mechanized mining involves creation of benches that are used for the purpose of drilling, blasting, and finally the transportation of the iron ore to the crushing plant.

## Process Of Iron Mining
The Mining Process. 1. Mining open pit and underground. To define the ore from the waste rock samples are taken and assayed. Assay results are used to mark out areas of ore and waste rock which are mined separately. Some of the harder areas require blasting to loosen the rock prior to excavation by hydraulic diggers.

## Iron ore
Mining iron ore is a high-volume, low-margin business, as the value of iron is significantly lower than base metals.  The second method involves oxidizing the phosphorus during the fining process by adding iron oxide. This technique is usually associated with puddling in the 19th century, and may not have been understood earlier.

Rocks with large concentrations of minerals, are called ores. Mining depends on finding good quality ore, preferably within a small area. The next step is to get the rocks which contain the mineral out of the ground. Once the ore is on the surface, the process of getting the mineral you want out of the rock can start.
