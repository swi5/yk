## USA - Gold inquartation process - Google Patents
A method of refining a precious metal comprising the steps of inquarting the material containing the precious metal into an alloy, with a known quantity of a base metal to form an alloy of a known concentration of the precious metal, and dissolving the base metal in acid to leave the refined precious metal as a solid. Preferably the method is used to refine gold, and the acid used is nitric

## Gold Refinery :the process, machineries and project information
For refining, gold bearing alloys are processed on different methods, depending on their carat content. Two methods are commonly employed for purification: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process. Alternatively, it can be a complex mix of burning, drying, grinding, screening, blending and sampling for low-grade scrap and floor sweepings.

## How to Refine Gold: 2 Major Techniques of Gold Refining Process
Two (2) major techniques for refining gold. Generally, gold can be refined using these two-best-known gold-refining procedures: Aqua Regia and gold electrolysis. Both of these techniques can be used to separate gold from other metals. This is because a little piece of other metals in gold can change its properties and value.

## Gold parting
The Miller process affords gold up to 99.5% purity. The process involves blowing a stream of chlorine through molten gold. Impurities in the gold form chlorides, which form a slag that floats on the molten gold. [2] [3] Invented by Emil Wohlwill in 1874, the Wohlwill process produces the highest purity gold (99.999%).

## Everything about Gold Processing, Smelting, Refining, Cyanidation
Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## Balestri Technologies - Gold alloys inquartation
Inquartation is a pre-refining technique used on alloys with a high silver content (>10%) that cannot be directly treated with Aqua Regia. With this technique the starting material is melted with silver and copper to produce an alloy of 25% gold (corresponding to ¼ of the total, hence the term inquartation) then treated with Aqua Regia (nitric acid (HNO 3) and the metals purified.

The process is complete when purple fumes of gold chloride start to form, usually when the gold content reaches a purity of 99.6 to 99.7 percent. Any PGMs present are not removed, and further refining is necessary if pure gold is required. The typical gold purity achieved by this process is 99.5 percent, with silver as the main impurity.

This is called "inquartation.". The resulting bead is cleaned, flattened by a hammer, and dropped into nitric acid. Even if the gold is less than one-fourth the weight of the bead, additional silver is sometimes required. When the amount of gold is small, it is convenient to use a large proportion of silver in parting.

## refining of gold by quartation
The two gold refining methods most commonly employed to derive pure gold are: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process. The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold.
