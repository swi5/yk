## 6 Common Threats to Pumps in Mining Applications
The key to overcoming this challenge is proper sump design. Clean water should be collected at the source, while abrasive solids-laden water should be separated into an isolated area within the sump. 2. Corrosion. The fluids in mining applications are among the most volatile a pump can move.

## The Berkeley Pit: The Water Returns Historical Marker
During the years of underground mining, pumps were used to keep groundwater from filling the underground workings. The main pump station was located on the 3,900 foot level of the Kelley Mine. The pumps were turned off in 1982 and water started flowing back into the underground workings and the Berkeley Pit.

## Gland Seal Water Explained | Oil Sands Magazine
Slurry pumps used in oil sands mining facilities are equipped with gland water seals. Clean, pressurized gland water is pumped into the stuffing box, protecting the shaft from the abraisive process slurry.A steady supply of gland seal water is critical to maintaining operation of any Bitumen Production facility. Even a brief disruption can result in severe pump damage.
