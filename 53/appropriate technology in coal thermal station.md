## Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant - an overview - ScienceDirect
The function of the coal-fired thermal power plant is to convert the energy available in the coal to electricity. Coal power plants work by using several steps to convert stored energy in coal to usable electricity. The conversion from coal to electricity takes place in three stages. Stage 1 involves the conversion of energy in a boiler.

## Electronics
Electronics is a branch of physics and electrical engineering that deals with the emission, behaviour and effects of electrons using electronic devices.Electronics uses active devices to control electron flow by amplification and rectification, which distinguishes it from classical electrical engineering, which only uses passive effects such as resistance, capacitance and inductance to control
