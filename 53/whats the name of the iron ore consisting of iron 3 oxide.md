## Iron ore | BHP
There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

## whats the name of the iron ore consisting of iron 3 oxide
Iron(III) oxide or ferric oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Fe 2 O 3It is one of the three main oxides of iron, the other two being iron(II) oxide (FeO), which is rare; and iron(II,III) oxide (Fe 3 O 4), which also occurs naturally as the mineral magnetiteAs the mineral known as hematite, Fe 2 O 3 is the main source of iron for the steel industry.

## Iron Ore: Sedimentary Rock - Pictures, Definition & More - Geology
Earth's most important iron ore deposits are found in sedimentary rocks. They formed from chemical reactions that combined iron and oxygen in marine and fresh waters. The two most important minerals in these deposits are iron oxides: hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ). These iron ores have been mined to produce almost every iron and

## Iron | Geoscience Australia
Most iron ores mined today comprise the iron oxide minerals hematite, Fe 2 O 3 (70% Fe); goethite, Fe 2 O 3 s H 2 O, (63% Fe); limonite, a mixture of hydrated iron oxides (up to 60% Fe); and magnetite, Fe 3 O 4 (72% Fe). As with most iron ore mines throughout the world, all the major Australian iron ore mines are open cut. The iron-ore bearing
