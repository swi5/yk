## Production of Portland cement | 7 | Cement and Concrete | M.S.J Gan
The production of Portland cement involves the firing (burning) of calcareous material (normally limestone, sea shells etc.) with an argilla­ ceous material (clay, an aluminosilicate). The solid raw materials are crushed and mixed in ball mills, and then heated in a kiln to about 1500 °C. The firing results in the formation of a clinker which

Most often, hot air from the clinker cooler, so-called tertiary air, is utilized as combustion air (Fig. 2-4f). The consumption of fuel for calcination can account for up to 60% of fuel needed for cement production. The degree of decarbonisation constitutes 90-95% and solid material enters the rotary kiln with a temperature of about 900 oC.

Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement, in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica-bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silicates.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year, and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant.

Hydration. Introduction. Portland cement is a hydraulic cement, hence it derives its strength from chemical reactions between the cement and water. The process is known as hydration. Cement consists of the following major compounds (see composition of cement ): Tricalcium silicate, C 3 S. Dicalcium silicate, C 2 S. Tricalcium aluminate, C 3 A.

Cement is made from gypsum, shale or clay, and limestone. The term "cement" is most often used to refer to Portland cement. Portland cement, when mixed with sand, gravel, and water, makes concrete, which is an essential element of the construction industry. Portland cement accounts for more than 95% of all cement produced.

## Superplasticized Portland cement: Production and compressive strength 
This paper describes the production of laboratory-produced high-volume fly ash blended cements. The effect of grinding of the Portland cement clinker, fly ash, and gypsum with or without a superplasticizer on the physical properties of the cements, and the compressive strength of the mortars made with the resulting blended cements, is discussed.

## How Portland Cement is Made? Manufacturing Process of Portland Cement
Portland cement can be made by following two different processes - a dry one and a wet one. Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century. Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement. The materials that are commonly used are limestone, shells, chalk, shale, clay, slate, silica sand, and iron ore. Since limestone is the main
