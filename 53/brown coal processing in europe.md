## Uses of raw sugarnthey
The FDA defines raw sugar thus: " Raw sugar " is the term generally applied to the intermediate food product as it leaves the sugar factory mill for further refinement in sugar refineries before use as food. In general, raw sugar is unsuitable for human food use because it contains extraneous impurities which are removed in the refining process.

## Europe's brown coal-free rural regions | EIT
Aug 23, 2021The brown coal market is still significant in Europe. The mining of lignite is quantitatively much larger than that of hard coal, as much more coal is needed to produce the same amount of energy. 244 million tonnes of it was mined in Europe in 2020, most of it in Germany, which is the main producer. In 2018, 9 % of the total gross electricity

Coal production and consumption statistics Statistics. A big part of hard coal (47 % in 2019) and the majority of brown coal (83 % in 2019) is used for power production. In 2019, 83 million tonnes of hard coal were delivered to power plants in the EU producing electricity and heat. For brown coal, this amount was 256 million tonnes.
