## Discrimination of Six Flotation Kinetic Models Used in the Conventional 
For all flotation tests, tap water was added to maintain a constant pulp level and froth layer of 1 cm. Kerosene and sec-octyl alcohol were used as the collector and frother, respectively, for all flotation tests. For a typical flotation test, the mass of coal particles was 30 g, which resulted in a solid concentration of 60 g/L.

## Froth floatation process used for the concentration of sulphide ore:
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophobic. In some cases, for example, sulphides ores of copper, zinc and lead concentration is brought by this method.In this method, the advantage is taken of the preferential wetting of the ore by an oil.The finely ground ore is taken in a tank containing water and 1% of pine oil or turpentine oil.

When the ore is roughed, the pulp concentration is 25% ~ 35%, and the flotation fine particles and the ore with high mud content is 10% ~ 20%. When the flotation density of the mineral, the material particles are larger, the use of thick pulp. When the flotation density is small, the mineral of fine grain and slime material is used thinner pulp.

## Graphite ore flotation processing flow chart
This graphite ore flotation plant including: (1) Preparation processing: first and second crushing, and coarse milling. (2) Flotation processing: rough separating, sweeping separating and fine separating. (3) Concentrates treatment: dewatering, drying, screening and packing. The raw ores are mainly flake graphite, gaugue minerals are calcite
