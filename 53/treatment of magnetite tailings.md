## Tailings Management With Paste Thickening
From the rod mill, the material proceeds to the cobber magnetic separators. Any non-magnetic material that has been released by the rod mill is separated and sent to the tailings thickener. Magnetite iron ore particles are separated by the magnetite separator from the gangue (waste material) minerals in the cobber magnetic separators.

## Treatment of tailings in mining operations | Condorchem Envitech
Wastewater produced by the mining industry is also known as tailings. Tailings contain waste from the extraction processes, equipment washing water and the refining process. It is a sludge-like waste that contains a mixture of fine gangue particles, chemicals and water; and in many cases is stored in large facilities called tailings dams or ponds.

## Treatment Of Magnetite Tailings
Treatment Of Magnetite Tailings. Extraction of iron iron mining iron ore processing,when the magnetite content mixed in hematite is higher, reverse flotation is a more convenient method for the extraction of iron ore. strong magnetic flotation combined separation. the main treatment methods of iron ore tailings at present are: tailings reprocessing, tailings dry stacking and full tailings

## CNA - Process for producing direct reduced iron powder by 
The invention discloses a process for producing direct reduced iron powder by using coke oven gas for reducing titanic magnetite tailings. The process is characterized by including the steps: (1) raw material proportioning and pelletizing; (2) drying and heat treatment; (3) reducing; (4) magnetic separation. Balls preheated by the step (2) are placed into reduction equipment for reducing, the
