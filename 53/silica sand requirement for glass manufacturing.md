## Silica Sand - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Glass. Glass is manufactured by heating a mixture of silica sand and various metallic oxides/carbonates together in a furnace to a smooth and bubble-free melt at ∼1500°C. The usual glass used in the construction industry is soda glass. Formulations are very variable but typically might be: SiO 2. 70-75%.

Sources of Silica Sand: SiO2 is the chemical sign of silica and it is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Oxygen and Silicon. This sand is often got in the crystalline state and because of weathering, plankton fossilization takes place and that results in crystallizing SiO2. In most regions of the world, these are found as mines and it is obtained in high hardness.
