## how to calculate jaw crusher reduction ratio in oman
13/05/2019 Setting jaw crushers. Ideally, the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6-to-1. There are different ways to calculate reduction ratio, but the best way is something called the P80 factor. The reduction ratio is then calculated by comparing the input feed size passing 80 percent versus the discharge size that passes 80 percent.
