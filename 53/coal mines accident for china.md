The human cost of coal mining is also substantial in the United States. In a report entitled: "Mortality in Appalachian Coal Mining Regions: The Value of Statistical Life Lost," Michael Hendryx and Melissa Ahern conclude that the $8 billion per year of economic benefits provided to Appalachia by coal production are dwarfed by the $42 billion cost of premature deaths.

Chinese coal mines are the deadliest in the world. According to official figures, at least 3,200 people died in China's mines in 2008. The actual number could be even higher, as the Chinese government is suspected of covering up some accidents. Most accidents are blamed on a failure to follow safety regulations, including adequate ventilation and available fire control equipment.
