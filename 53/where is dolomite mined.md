Dolomite is a common rock-forming mineral. It is a calcium magnesium carbonate with a chemical composition of CaMg (CO 3) 2. It is the primary component of the sedimentary rock known as dolostone and the metamorphic rock known as dolomitic marble. Limestone that contains some dolomite is known as dolomitic limestone.

Dolomite as a ceramic material is a uniform calcium magnesium carbonate. In ceramic glazes, it is used as a source of magnesia and calcia. Other than talc, dolomite is the principal source of MgO in high-temperature raw glazes. 'Dolomite matte' stoneware glazes, for example, are highly prized for their pleasant 'silky' surface texture.

Dolomite. Dolomite is widely distributed in Texas except in the Coastal Plain and over the greater part of the High Plains. It occurs in beds of varying thickness and extent in rocks ranging from Precambrian to Cretaceous in age. Dolomite was mined from the Ellenburger Formation in Burnet County as an ore of magnesium during the 1940s.

dolomite, type of limestone, the carbonate fraction of which is dominated by the mineral dolomite, calcium magnesium carbonate [CaMg(CO3)2]. Along with calcite and aragonite, dolomite makes up approximately 2 percent of the Earth's crust. The bulk of the dolomite constitutes dolostone formations that occur as thick units of great areal extent in many sequences of chiefly marine strata.
