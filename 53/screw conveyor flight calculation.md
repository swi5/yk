The design promotes agitation by moving material from the bottom of the trough to the top, unlike a cut flight design. Material capacity is reduced with this design as well, this time by a factor of 3.0-3.5x. As an example, a regular flight conveyor carrying 9.0 tons/hour would carry 2.6-3.0 tons/hour as a cut and fold conveyor.

## Screw conveyor
A screw conveyor or auger conveyor is a mechanism that uses a rotating helical screw blade, called a "flighting", usually within a tube, to move liquid or granular materials.They are used in many bulk handling industries. Screw conveyors in modern industry are often used horizontally or at a slight incline as an efficient way to move semi-solid materials, including food waste, wood chips

## Screw Conveyor Flight Flat Pattern - Eng-Tips Forums
Example: 9" diameter screw x 4" core x 1/4" thick flight, 18" pitch, 90 degree segment. I dont mind being just close on the flat pattern. I can. afford to trial a couple of pieces prior to making the. final part. I just need a good starting point "formula" to work from.

Variable design of threaded/screw turbine is pitch, cylinder pipe radius (R0), thread length (L), and thread slope (K), threaded shaft diameter (Ri), number of blades (N), water discharge per cycle thread. With a good design, efficiency can be achieved between 79 to 84%. Figure 10 shows the construction of a screw turbine with a unique shape.
