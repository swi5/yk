## What should I socket Ik maul with?
Its incorrect. First of all you need 60 IAS assuming your weapon has base speed of 0. Secondly thats only on 2 handed weapons (2 handed swords require less as are treated as 1 handed weapons for WW) Ogre Maul has base speed of 10. With the IK Maul's bonus, thats -30. So you need extra 30 IAS to bring to -60 breakpoint.
