## Significance of Cyclone Resistant Buildings | Design Parameters
So from the light of all these experiences, it is recommended to follow certain guidelines and strategic planning during the design of buildings in cyclone-prone areas. For the construction of a better cyclone-resistant building, various factors should be considered such as the velocity of wind, building geometry, type of building material, characteristics of soil, and the aerodynamics of flow

## Cement Manufacturing Process | Phases | Flow Chart | Cement
Cement Manufacturing Process Phase 1: Raw Material Extraction. Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. Such raw materials are limestone, clay and sand. Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand & clay fulfill the need of silicon, iron and aluminum.

## Process flow of cement rotary kiln
The raw materials exchange heat with the hot gas flow, and enter the decomposition calcination after reaching the cyclone. Then, the feed gas is separated in the coal of the fifth cyclone, and then enters the kiln for calcination. The dust collected at the kiln head and the clinker discharged from the grate cooler are discharged in turn.

A cement plant in Matozinhos, Brazil is one of Brazil's leading cement production facilities. Opened in 1959, the plant produces 660,000 (600,000 metric tons) tons of clinker per year. The need to improve efficiency and maintain production without outages led company officials to consider ways to improve flow through the plant's pre-heater

Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones, slates, and some shales, with the aid of blasting when necessary. Some deposits are mined by underground methods. Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators. The excavated materials are transported to the crushing plant by trucks, railway

With material suitable for cyclonic separation, cyclones prove to be effective as separators. A good pneumatic system efficiently separates material from the flow of air when it reaches the destination. When the material is of a consistency and weight suitable for cyclonic separation, a cyclone is the adequate separator.

When specifying cyclones, one of the first steps is understanding the type of gas and particulate material to be separated. Particle size, shape, density, melt temperature and moisture content rank among the key characteristics. Plastic pellets are relatively soft with a relatively low melt temperature of °F.
