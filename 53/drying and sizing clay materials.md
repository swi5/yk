## Clay Shrinkage During Drying and Firing | Preventing Defects
Our testing showed that about 5% shrink during the drying process, 1/2% during bisque firing (cone 06) and 5.5% during glaze firing (cone 6). The total of 11% is shown in the lantern picture below (before and after). We also found through out after years of firing that even with the same clay body, shrinkage can vary 1-2% from batch to batch.

## Effect of Drying on Clay Clogging of Pervious Concrete
Clay drying may cause difficult-to-recover clogging due to two factors, namely, drying increases particle-to-particle cohesion and particle adhesion to pore walls, and drying causes particles to shrink to form aggregates that are larger than the pore size. This study facilitates the development of effective pavement maintenance strategies.

## Clay Firing Process | Tips
Air Dry Clay. Wet clay contains a large amount of water, a minimum of 25%, actually. When clay starts to dry, water evaporates from it. As this happens, the particles of clay are drawn closer together resulting in shrinkage. Many problems with clay are formed by uneven rates of drying, which create stresses in the clay.

## Drying process of clay ceramic materials: a review
Dec 3, 2020Drying is a heat and mass transfer operation involving the removal of moisture, being an important and expensive step in the manufacturing process of several products. For ceramic materials, the drying process is necessary to remove the water that was added to the clay in the molding step and to provide the necessary strength to reduce the chances of failure during the product firing step.
