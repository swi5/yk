## Three Phase Induction Motor Construction - Your Electrical Guide
In this article, I am discussing about three phase induction motor construction. The three-phase induction motors are the most commonly used AC motors in the industry because they have simple and rugged construction, low cost, high efficiency, reasonably good power factor, self-starting torque and require little maintenance. Almost more than 90

## Air Conditioner Working Principle Simple Explanation with Diagram
The principle of air conditioning is based on the laws of thermodynamics. An air conditioner operates using the refrigeration cycle. Specific refrigerants are needed as the working fluid in the refrigeration cycle. An air conditioner goes through 4 processes; compression, condensation, expansion, and evaporation.

## Construction of Alternator | Electrical4U
The construction of an alternator consists of field poles placed on the rotating fixture of the machine. An alternator is made up of two main parts: a rotor and a stator. The rotor rotates in the stator, and the field poles get projected onto the rotor body of the alternator. The armature conductors are housed on the stator.

## AC Winding | Phase Grouping | Types of Winding
AC Winding: Ac winding are generally of a 3-phase kind because of the inherent advantages of a 3-phase machine. The armature coils must be connected to yield balanced (equal in magnitude and successive phase difference of 2π/3 rad) 3-phase emfs. To begin with the slots around the armature periphery must be divided into phase-bands.

The fundamental operation of an AC Motor depends on the principle of magnetism. The simple AC Motor contains a coil of wire and two fixed magnets surrounding a shaft. When an electric (AC) charge applies to the coil of wire, it becomes an electromagnet. This electromagnet generates a magnetic field. Inside the stator, there is a solid metal

## Relayshirn
Relays of this type are intended for manual soldering. No mea-sures are taken against penetration of flux and cleaning solvent into the relay.This type of relay cannot be immersion-cleaned. Flux-protection Relays Special design construction prevents flux from penetrating into the relay housing, for example, due to capillary action up the ter-.omron 2bphase 2bin 2brelay 2bcontroller 2bfailure

## DC Machine Construction and Operation | Electrical Academia
The operation is basically the same as the foregoing description for the simple DC machines. For motor operation, a DC voltage is applied to the armature terminals. The commutator inverts the DC to provide an AC voltage to the armature windings. The difference, of course, between the machines shown in Figures 9 and 10 and the simple DC machine
