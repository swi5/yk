## Raw materials - Understanding Cement
Technically, a cement producer can have almost complete control over clinker composition by blending raw materials of different compositions to produce the desired result. In practice, however, clinker composition is largely determined by the compositions of the locally-available raw materials which make up the bulk of the raw meal.

## How much clinker is required to make one ton of cement?
Answer: Portland cement clinker is the material that gets ground up (possibly with gypsum and other small quantities of material) to become Portland cement. Clinker is in the form of rounded granules, typically 3 to 25mm diameter. Those granules are the sintered output from large rotary kilns.
