## How to Protect Joint Sand from washing Out Between Pavers | Concrete 
Jan 26, 2022To protect joint sand from washing out between pavers it needs to be sealed. Once the pavers are cleaned and new joint sand is installed the entire surface can be sealed. This can enhance the beauty of the pavers and help to lock out moisture. The sealer will also solidify the joint sand so it will not wash away or erode as easily.

## What is Poly Sand Haze? | Concrete Sealing Ratings
The water reacts with the poly sand and creates a binding agent that helps bind the sand particles together. However, before water is misted onto the surface, the poly sand dust leftover on the surface must be completely removed. If the poly sand dust is not removed, it will create a white haze on top of the pavers. This is called poly sand haze.

Common in, you guessed it, concrete and asphalt, concrete sand is first mined from the ground, screened and washed with water to remove the fine silt and any natural contaminates. Concrete sand is made into actual concrete by mixing it with water and cement. It is then ready to pour and smooth out before putting on the finishing touches.
