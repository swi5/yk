How many years does it take limestone to form? Limestone stalactites form extremely slowly - usually less than 10cm every thousand years - and radiometric dating has shown that some are over 190 000 years old. Stalactites can also form by a different chemical process when water drips through concrete and this is much faster.

## Concrete
The cement reacts with the water through a process called concrete hydration that hardens over several hours to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses. [8] This time allows concrete to not only be cast in forms but also to have a variety of tooled processes preformed.
