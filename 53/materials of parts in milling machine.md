## What Is Lathe and Milling: What's the Difference?
Lathes and milling machines are two essential machines used in the manufacturing industry, they are Subtractive manufacturing involves cutting away from a solid block of material. It could be a block of, for example, metal, plastic, or wood. A milling machine or lathe machine cutting/hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic is an example of subtractive manufacturing.

Unlike lathes, which have been around for thousands of years, milling machines are less than 200 years old. Because they require much more power than hand-driven lathes, the introduction of milling machines had to wait for the invention of industrial water and steam power. Also, their mechanical components had to first be made available, such as accurately fitted slides, large castings to

A milling ( machine ) removes metal by rotating a multi -point cutting tool against a work piece. The work piece or jobs are fixed on the work table and feed is given against the tool. The table can be given three type of movements: 1. Longitudinal cross wise. 2. Vertical movements. 3. Rotational movements.

All milling machines product swarf during operation. Going back to the basics of milling, this process is designed to remove material from workpieces. As the cutting tool presses against the workpiece, it cuts or digs out material. The material removed from milling is known as swarf or chips. Most manufacturing companies recycle or reuse swarf.

In milling the cutting tool is moved in all three dimensions to achieve the desired part shape. In milling the cutting tool usually rotates about an axis that is perpendicular to the table that holds the material to be cut. A milling machine looks somewhat like a drill press at first glance. A cutting tool protrudes down from a rotating spindle.

Each Custom Road begins its life as one of 9 unique carbon parts that are assembled to create the Custom Road Chassis. These parts are made using a mix of unidirectional carbon fiber, spread-tow fiber, and other materials to achieve our goals for.These fibers are bundled and then combined in various ways to create carbon fiber reinforcement and parts that take on this strength property.

## CNC Machining Guide - Machine Types, Benefits | CNC Machined Parts
CNC Turning Machines (Lathes) In CNC turning operations, the cutting tool remains stationary while the workpiece rotates at a high speed on a spindle. CNC turning offers the ability to produce cylindrical parts quickly and with tight tolerances. For example, Technox Machine and Manufacturing has CNC lathes that can produce parts with dimensions of up to 152″ in diameter and 240″ in length
