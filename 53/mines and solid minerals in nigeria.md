## RENEWED INTEREST FOR SOLID MINERALS IN NIGERIA - AfroEden
Tin, columbite, coal, and so on, were the early solid minerals that contributed significantly to Nigeria's economy but declined due to the oil boom that started in 1970 till date. The recent return and attention to solid minerals were necessitated mainly by international oil politics, and the need to diversify Nigeria's economy.

## Mining industry of Nigeria
Mining is the extraction or removal of minerals and metals from the earth. The Nigerian Coal Corporation is a parastatal corporation that was formed in 1950 and held a monopoly on the mining, processing, and sales of coal, lignite, and coke products until 1999.. Coal was first discovered in Enugu in 1909 at the Udi Ridge in Enugu. It was found by Albert Kitson, a British mine engineer.
