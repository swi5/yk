## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels, called adits, to reach the ore. Underground mining is, however, relatively expensive and is

## Ore sorting and pre-concentration - Resourceful Paths
Ore sorting and pre-concentration - potential to boost profit and ease risks. Ore sorting and pre-concentration methods are used to separate waste from ore, and direct materials to optimal processing or disposal destinations. For amenable ores, they can increase feed grade, lower ore throughput and operating costs, and reduce environmental impact.
