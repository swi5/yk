As with crusher run, blinding materials contain a mix of sizes, from the maximum size that the screen mesh can pass, down to dust. Blinding, because it is finer than crusher run, is used for final shaping up of construction sub bases, particularly in road construction, where the sub base is the last unbound layer before coated materials are laid.
