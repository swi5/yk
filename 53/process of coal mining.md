## Surface Mining Process | Steps In The Mining Process & Surface Types - AMS
Coal is usually removed using three main methods; Surface mining - is ideal when the coal is less than 200 feet in the ground. In this case, the large machines will help remove the layers of rock and topsoil which is known as overburden in order to expose the coal seams.

Coal mining, the free encyclopedia. The goal of coal mining is to obtain coal from the ground.  Once this strip is empty of coal, the process is repeated with a new strip being created next to it.

Large machines remove the topsoil and layers of rock known as overburden to expose coal seams. Mountaintop removal is a form of surface mining where the tops of mountains are dynamited and removed to access coal seams. Underground mining, or deep mining, is necessary when the coal is roughly over 90 metres below the earth's surface. Some

## How Coal Works | Union of Concerned Scientists
Two dominant methods account for the vast majority of underground coal mining: "room and pillar" and "longwall" mining.. In room and pillar mining, seams of coal are partially mined, leaving large pillars of coal intact to support the overlying layers of rock. When finished, miners practice "retreat" mining, extracting as much coal as possible from the remaining pillars as they

Open-pit mining. Some 53% of South Africa's coal is produced from surface mining, via open-cast or open-pit mines. This is because the coal is less than 60 metres below the surface. Open-pit mines use draglines, as well as truck and shovel operations to extract coal. A dragline excavator uses a dragline to pull a bucket by a wire cable.

The process of strip mining also lowers groundwater levels around the mine. In order to remove the coal, vast quantities of groundwater are pumped out of the mine and as a result, surrounding ecosystems and farmland may become drier, and erosion may start to change the landscape. Strip mining also uses significant amount of water to suppress dust.

As mining of coal depends on the depth and quality of the coal seams, different techniques are used to dig the deposits. Surface mining and deep underground mining are the two main methods of mining coal.  The overburden taken out from the first strip is deposited outside the mining place. This process is referred to as out-of-pit dumping

## Coal Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Since the 1960s, surface mining methods have become more common, and today they account for more than half of the coal produced in the United States. In this approach, also known as strip mining, oversized bulldozers remove the land surface until coal is exposed, producing large amounts of waste rock—and dust—in the process.

This process is repeated to concentrate the gold bearing ore and separate it from the waste rock (increasing the grade of the ore). The flotation units catch 70% of the gold collected at Macraes, with the primary roughers collecting the other 30%. The slurry that doesn't contain any gold is neutralised and sent to the tailings dam.
