## Raw Materials of Cement - Expert Civil
High content magnesia makes the cement unsound. Calcium Sulphate ( CaSO4): This ingredients is in the form og gypsum and its function is to increase the initial setting time of cement. Sulphur (S): A very small amount of sulphur is useful in making the sound of cement. If it in excess, it causes the cement to become unsound.

## Cement
A cement is a binder, a substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel, produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is behind only water as

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## What materials are used in cement?
Cement is traditionally made by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) with small amounts of other materials (such as clay) to 1450°C in a kiln. The resulting hard substance, called 'clinker', is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder to make 'Ordinary Portland Cement', the most commonly used type of cement.

## Concrete Materials - Mix Components - Concrete Network
SCMs are used as replacement for cement, and since they have a very small particle size, they reduce the permeability of concrete, which is good. Fly ash is the most common SCM and it improves finishability, although it tends to slow the set time, especially in cold weather. SCMs can be used to replace as much as 40% of the cement in a mix.
