## DIY Terrazzo Concrete Formula | Hunker
Step 1. Choose an aggregate type and size. Terrazzo concrete floors consist of marble, glass, plastic, river rock or mother-of-pearl aggregates. Pebble-sized aggregate closely packs, giving the look of granite. Use large chunks of aggregate to show off the color or material of the aggregate and create an assertive flooring appearance.

The standard ratio for average mortar mix is 3:1 or 4:1 for bricklaying. If you are using a pointing mix, then you should have a ratio of 1:4 or 1:5 mortar to sand. As for concrete, it depends on the strength you need it to be at. Usually, it is good practice to mix concrete at 1:2 mix to materials.

In terms of the ratio for concrete, it depends on what strength you are trying to achieve, but as a general guide a standard concrete mix would be 1 part cement to 2 parts sand to 4 parts aggregates. For foundations, a mix of 1 part cement to 3 parts sand to 6 parts aggregates can be used.

The lower the w/c ratio, the higher the concrete strength. All materials used for a design including the water quality should be to a high standard.
