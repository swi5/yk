## Structural vibration: What is it and how to control it
Structural vibration occurs when forces generated by machines such as compressors, pumps, chillers and air handling equipment, causes the structural steels to vibrate. Consequently, this can prompt equipment failure, noise transfer and most importantly, safety concerns. The vibration is due to the structure being mechanically resonant.
