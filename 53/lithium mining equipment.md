## Lithium Mining Issues - Advancing Mining
Sep 14, 2021Lithium Needed for Hybrid Mining Equipment Batteries. Hybrid drive mining trucks, utilizing lithium-ion batteries, are in the works to help the environment — especially since these trucks have the opportunity to recuperate a considerable amount of energy downhill and store it in batteries.

## Commercial Lithium Production and Mining of Lithium - ThoughtCo
By. Terence Bell. Updated on August 21, 2020. Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene. Lithium production from clay sources is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022.
