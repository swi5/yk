## Origin of the Surigao iron ores | Economic Geology | GeoScienceWorld
Abstract The iron ore deposit of Surigao, Mindanao, Philippine islands, occurs as a surficial mantle over serpentinized ultrabasic rocks. The ore is lateritic in origin, having been derived by subaerial decomposition of the parent serpentine rock. The Surigao deposit resembles closely the lateritic iron ores of Mayari, Cuba.

## Geology, Prospecting and Exploration for Iron Ore Deposits
In these deposits, iron often occurs as siderite (FeCO3) or sometimes as oxides. Sedimentary ores - These are (i) bedded ores, (ii) siderite ores, (iii) placer ores, or (iv) bog iron ores. 'Bedded iron ores' are often composed of oölites of hematite, siderite, iron silicate or, less commonly, limonite in a matrix of siderite, calcite or silicate.

Iron ores, usually rich in iron oxide, are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined. There are four main types of iron ore deposits worked currently: magnetite, hematite, pisolitic ironstone, and titanomagnetite deposits. Pure iron metal is silvery white in colour

By far the most important metal from an economic and technical point of view is iron. Sedimentary iron deposits, from which almost all iron is obtained, can therefore be viewed as one of the world's great mineral treasures. There are two major types of deposit. The first, and by far the most important, is banded iron formations (BIFs), so called because they are finely layered alternations
