## Production of Crushed Sand Using Underwater Pulsed Dsicharge
In this study, the coarse aggregate was crushed by underwater pulsed discharge to produce crushed sand, and the voltage condition with good treatment efficiency was optimized. Oven-dry density and water absorption ration of crushed sand were measured and evaluated as to whether it meets the industrial standards.

Aggregate " is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand, gravel and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water, bitumen, portland cement, lime, etc.) to form compound materials (such as asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete). By volume, aggregate generally accounts for 92 to 96 percent of HMA and about 70 to 80 percent of portland cement concrete.

## Crushed Stone Aggregates - Lehigh Hanson, Inc.
Crushed stone aggregates are produced by crushing quarried rock, then screening it to sizes appropriate for the intended use. Production of crushed stone has three stages: Primary crushing to break down the stone to a manageable size; secondary and tertiary crushing to render the rocks into sizes specific to their applications; and screening to separate the crushed stone for further processing
