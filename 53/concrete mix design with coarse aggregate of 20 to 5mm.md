## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Coarse Aggregates: Types, Properites & Applications
1.Size of Coarse Aggregates: The size of the coarse aggregate depends on the use of the concrete is to be poured. For large-scale concreting operations without complex reinforcement, large aggregates of size 80 mm, 40 mm, 20 mm are used. For the simple construction of residential or other buildings, 20 mm is the maximum size will be used.

Unit weight of aggregate:- unit weight or density of 10mm, 12mm, 12.5mm, 20mm & 40mm coarse aggregate/ crushed stone/ gravel/ coarse sand is ranging between 1425 kg/m3 to 1575 kg/m3, it means weight of 1 cubic meter of course aggregate is around 1425kg to 1575kg or 1.425 to 1.575 MT.It's advisable to sample the coarse aggregates or crushed stone from the site

and, Wc= Free-water content appropriate to type of coarse aggregate. Note:- The above combined obtained grading is for PPC and OPC mixes. For OPC + Flyash Mix fine aggregate is about 43%, 10 mm 20% and 20 mm is 37%. This is also within the permissible limits of recommended grading for pumped concrete.

## Designing a Lightweight Structural Concrete Mix - Concrete Construction
If fine and coarse aggregate are considered separtely, the total lightweight aggregate for one cubic yard of concrete will usually be form 30 to 32 cubic feet on a dry, loose basis. Total waer requirement for the particular aggregate is best obtained form the aggregate supplier. It can range from 350 pounds per cubic yard for a well-shaped
