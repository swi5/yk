## Old,pedal powered grinding wheels - Bladesmith's Forum Board
"toxonix"'s post about building a wet grinder got me thinking about the old pedal powered grinding stones. A friend of mine has one in his living room as "decoration". It has a cast Iron seat on it, kind of like an old tractor seat, then pedals to turn the wheel. The wheel itself is approximately 30" in diameter, and around 3" wide.

## Grinding Wheel — Greater West Bloomfield Historical Society
The typical "farmyard" grindstone would have been used to sharpen ax blades, knives, hoes, and other farm implements. Small amounts of water dripping on the stone as it turns (wet grinding), keeps the stone from over-heating. Early grinding wheels, rotated by two cranks, one on each end of its axle, date from around 1340.

David Weaver that one looks like it was probably a low speed wheel given that it's not dressed and it's sitting dry on a light weight stand. I did notice in urban explorer pictures that the old George Barnsley works in sheffield there were several large silicon carbide wheels sitting around in good shape (just filthy from sitting).
