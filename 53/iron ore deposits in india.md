## How To Find Iron Ore In Real Life - Realonomics
Together these nine countries produce 80 percent of the world's iron ore. How can you identify iron ore? Iron ore is put down in layers and runs in "veins " much like gold. Test the mined rock ore. Using a small rare earth magnet test each portion of the rock for traces of magnetism. If iron ore exists it will be magnetic.

What is iron ore? Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red.

Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.
