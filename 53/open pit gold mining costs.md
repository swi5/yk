## Open-Pit Mining | Method and Process | Epiroc US
Open-pit mining technology. Open-pit mining clearly offers a number of economic advantages over underground mining, especially now that mineral-processing technology has advanced to the stage where very low-grade ores can be treated profitably. 100 to 150 years ago, this was not the case, and mining was still much more selective.

In metal open-pit mine, the ore loss rate is generally 3% ~ 5% and dilution rate is generally 5% ~ 8%. While in underground mining, the ore loss rate is generally 15% ~ 25% and dilution rate is 3% ~ 20%. Therefore, open pit mining is beneficial to the full recovery of mineral resources.

## An Overview of the Open Pit Mining Process
An Overview of the Open Pit Mining Process. Open-pit mining which is sometimes referred to as open cut mining, opencast mining or simply strip mining is a mining technique that extracts important minerals from a borrow or an open pit. There are two types of mining methods commonly used in large scale mineral mining; open pit mining and tunneling.

## Open-Pit Mining Methods - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
When the open pit at Sacramento Hill, Bisbee, Ariz., became so deep that hauling ore from the pit was too expensive, the deep ore was mined by glory-holing. In 1929, 574,000 tons and in 1930, 304,000 tons were mined by this method. The bottom of the old pit was oval, about 450 feet long and 400 feet wide.

8.2.3.1 Open pit mining Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

## Open Pit (Open Cast) Mining - Gold Companies Explained
Open Pit (Open Cast) Mining. Open pit, or open cast, mines excavate ore from the surface creating a hole in ground. Open pit mining is generally less expensive than underground mining. Whether or not a deposit can be open pit mined will depend on the shape and depth of the ore deposit. The main issue for an open pit mine design is the strip ratio.

## Australia's gold mines by production, grades and costs Part 1
As a case in point, a mine that produces 100,000 ounces of gold and 10,000 tonnes of copper per year at a cost of US$1000 per ounce, not including revenues generated from the sale of copper, will have AISCs well below US$1000 per ounce after the by-product credits are taken into account.

## Open-Pit Mining | Method and Process | Epiroc
Open-pit mining technology. Open-pit mining clearly offers a number of economic advantages over underground mining, especially now that mineral-processing technology has advanced to the stage where very low-grade ores can be treated profitably. 100 to 150 years ago, this was not the case, and mining was still much more selective.
