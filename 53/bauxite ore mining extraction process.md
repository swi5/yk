The Chemistry and Processing of Jamaican Bauxite. The first commercial extraction of alumina (Al 2 O 3) from bauxite has been attributed to Henri Sainte-Claire Deville in about 1854. Soon after this, in 1888, Karl Joseph Bayer described what is now known as the Bayer Process, which led to a dramatic reduction in the cost of aluminum metal.

Bauxite ore contains 30-60% aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3). In the Bayer process (Figure 2), the bauxite is digested in a pressure vessel along with a sodium hydroxide solution (caustic soda) at an elevated temperature, which dissolves the aluminum oxide converting it into sodium aluminate, leaving insoluble red mud solids as a by-product. The alumina is extracted from the bauxite by means of the

## Bauxite Mining and Alumina Refining: Process Description and  - LWW
The typical processes involved in the mining of surface deposits are as follows: Clearing of vegetation and collection of valuable topsoil using scrapers and bulldozers. Removal of overburden. Blasting or ripping of some parts of the ore that cannot be dug easily. This involves drilling and placing explosives, or ripping with large bulldozers.

## Where bauxite is found in the world?
How Bauxite is processed? Bayer process. The Bayer process is the principal industrial means of refining bauxite to produce alumina (aluminium oxide). Bauxite, the most important ore of aluminium, contains only 30-60% aluminium oxide, (alumina), Al2O3, the rest being a mixture of silica, various iron oxides, and titanium dioxide.
