Manufacturing Process: The main raw material for this industry is sugarcane. A typical flow diagram for sugar production is given in Fig. 15.1. The sugarcane is cut into pieces and crushed in a series of rollers to extract the juice in the 'mill house'. The fibrous residue of the mill house is discarded as bagasse.

## The Abolition ofurfussball-essen
The production of sugar required - and killed - hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans. So, between 1748 and 1788 over 1,200 ships brought over 335,000 enslaved Africans to Jamaica, Britain's largest sugar-producing colony. Yet in 1788 a Jamaican census recorded that only 226,432 enslaved men, women and children were alive on the island.

##  System of Cane Sugar Factory Control - Qut
The manufacture of cane sugar from sugar cane is a distinc­ tive industrial process in that it involves no element of synthesis. Sucrose comes into the factory in the cane, and, subject to some physical losses and some destruction, emerges in the product, crystal sugar. The process is essentially a combination of separation and concentration.

Australia's first commercial sugar mill was established in 1864 at Ormiston, in Brisbane, by Captain Louis Hope. The number of sugar mills throughout Queensland and northern New South Wales increased as the sugar cane growing industry began to expand. In 1892, there were as many as 72 sugar and juice mills ion operation throughout Queensland.

The juice is extracted from the shredded sugarcane by crushing the product in a cane mill. A typical mill consists of three cast iron crushing rolls that work together (top roll, feed roll, and discharge roll). Typically, a series of these mills will be used sequentially (referred to as a mill train) in order to maximize the extraction efficiency.
