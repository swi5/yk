## Iron ore | BHP
There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

## Iron ore | BHP
Mixing with coke Iron ore is mixed with coke (from super-heated metallurgical coal) in a blast furnace. Heating Air that has been heated to around 1,200°C is injected into the furnace, converting the iron ore to molten pig iron and slag. Removing impurities Once impurities are removed, alloying elements are added.

## Detection and segmentation of iron ore green pellets in images using 
In steel manufacturing industry, powdered iron ore is agglomerated in a pelletizing disk to form iron ore green pellets. The agglomeration process is usually monitored using a camera. As pellet size distribution is one of the major measures of product quality monitoring, pellets detection and segmentation from the image are the key steps to determine the pellet size. Traditional image
