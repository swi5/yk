Pig iron, also known as crude iron, is an intermediate product of the iron industry in the production of steel which is obtained by smelting iron ore in a blast furnace.Pig iron has a very high carbon content, typically 3.8-4.7%, along with silica and other constituents of dross, which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications.

The delay in the auctioning of mines in Odisha - which were to be held in March 2019 - due to the lack of clarity on the maximum lease area, impacted production in the state.
