## What Equipment is Used for Cement Manufacturing? - Prater
Because raw coal is still used in cement manufacturing, equipment that can grind coal onsite is necessary for most cement plants. As with the actual milling of cement, manufacturing equipment used to break down the coal requires mechanisms with airlock capabilities. These must be able to handle capacities from 10-100 tons hourly.
