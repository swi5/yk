## What are raw materials used in chemical industries? - Quora
The raw materials for common cement are limestone and clay. There are five steps to produce cement. The process begins with the crushing of limestone and clay, and then the powder is blended in a mixer. The next stage of the process is happening in rotating heater. As you can see through the equipment's name, the powder is heated in this stage.

## Name the important raw materials used in the manufacturing of cement 
The following are some of the most important raw materials used in the manufacturing of cement: (i) Limestone : Used to make the clinker, or the main ingredient in cement. (ii) Sand : Used to make up around 60% of cement and to provide a smooth texture and finish to the product. (iii) Clay : Used to make up around 10% of cement and to act as a binder and absorbent.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.
