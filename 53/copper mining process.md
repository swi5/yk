The Basics of Copper Mining and Processing. Mined from open pits, copper ore must be crushed as part of the process that occurs between extraction and production. Using today's compact mining equipment, copper ore is extracted from the mine. After the ore is crushed, it's roasted, which helps to convert sulfides to oxides.
