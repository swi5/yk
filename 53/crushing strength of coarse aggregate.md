## Coarse Aggregate in Concrete Construction | Shyam Steel
Strength of Coarse Aggregate. The strength of the actual material will determine the final strength of the concrete mix. Some rocks and stones are stronger than others thus, giving higher resistance to cracking and crushing. Granite, for example, is far stronger than limestone. Therefore, it is a common aggregate used by contractors.

## Mechanical Properties of Aggregate - Construction How
Mechanical Properties of Aggregate. Concrete, in general, is a concoction of cement, aggregates and water. Each of these components accounts for a particular purpose or target. However, the liability of imparting strength and durability to concrete rests on aggregates, the coarse ones in particular. This is owing to the fact that aggregates

smaller sized coarse aggregate produces higher strengths for a given water-to-cement ratio. In fact, it is generally agreed that, although larger coarse aggregates can be used to make high-strength concrete, it is easier to do so with coarse aggregates below 12.5 mm (Y, in.) (ACI 363-95).

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - Determine Aggregate Crushing Strength 
The ' aggregate crushing value test ` gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. Aggregate crushing value is defined as the percentage by weight of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized

## Crushing Strength Of Coarse Aggregate Testing Procedure
Aggregate crushing value of coarse aggregate note 1 the aggregate crushing value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load with aggre gate of aggregate crushing value 30 or higher the result may be anomalous and in such cases the ten percent fines value should be determined instead note 2 the standard aggregate crushing test.
