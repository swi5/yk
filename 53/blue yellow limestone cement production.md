For example, the carbonation resistance of concrete with a cement with only 15 mass % limestone was equal to that of a cement with 30 or even 50 mass % limestone when the w/c ratio was reduced from 0.5 to 0.35 or 0.3 (Figure 3). Of course, sophisticated process measures in cement plants are necessary for the production of high-limestone cements.

A lot of those emissions come from the production of cement, which is the second most consumed material on the planet behind water. Cement produces emissions in two main ways. One is through the chemical reactions that occur while sintering limestone and other materials to make "clinker," a key component of cement.
