## Windmills: What are they used for? What do they do? (Explained) - Ecavo
The first windmill to generate electricity was invented in 1888 by an Ohio-based engineer named Charles Brush. The windmill could generate up to 12 kilowatts of electricity and was a sixty foot post mill with a 56 foot rotor. In today's society windmills used to generate electricity are referred to as wind turbines.
