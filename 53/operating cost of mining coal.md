## Coal mines need lower costs and raised productivity
Oct 16, 2020Coal mines need lower costs and raised productivity. By Kwatani. Oct 16, 2020. Kwatani designed and manufactured robust grizzly coal screen. Despite South Africa's energy supply being heavily reliant on coal, weak prices and more demanding mining conditions are putting pressure on coal mines and their suppliers to do more with less.

## Prices and costs - Coal 2020 - Analysis - IEA
The cost structure of coal mining is determined mostly by operating expenses such as mining cash costs (e.g. labour, fuel, taxes and royalties) and transportation expenditures (e.g. inland transportation, port fees and seaborne freight rates). The proportions of these costs depend on the mining method, i.e. surface or underground mining, and

## operating cost of mining coal
The cost structure of coal mining is determined mostly by operating expenses such as mining cash costs (e.g. labour, fuel, taxes and royalties) and transportation expenditures (e.g. inland transportation, port fees and seaborne freight rates). The proportions of these costs depend on the mining method, i.e. surface or underground mining.
