Community Development Agreements (CDAs) in mining are contractual agreements between mining companies and local communities- and sometimes government bodies- on what development benefits a mining project will bring. CDAs, also know as Impact Benefit Agreements (IBAs) or Development Agreements, are growing in number and scope.
